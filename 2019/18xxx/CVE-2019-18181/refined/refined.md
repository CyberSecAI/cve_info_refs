- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The CloudVision Portal (CVP) allows users with read-only permissions to bypass intended restrictions on functionality. This is achieved via CVP API calls through the Configlet Builder modules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation. Read-only users can take actions that are normally restricted in the GUI via API calls. In affected 2018.1 releases this includes unauthorized read and write access to portions of the filesystem, while in 2018.2 releases this allows unauthorized read-only access.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An authenticated user with read-only access can bypass these restrictions to perform actions they should not be able to, potentially leading to unauthorized configuration changes.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through CVP API calls using the Configlet Builder modules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with read-only access to the CloudVision Portal.
