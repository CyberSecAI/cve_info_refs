**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Exposure of sensitive user data, including first name, last name, phone numbers, email addresses, and physical addresses.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Unauthenticated access via the `GetVCard` endpoint, likely through a web request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication is needed.

*   The vulnerability was patched on 02/19/2019 in version 8.6.
*   The fix involved securing the `GetVCard` functionality by adding authentication and authorization.
