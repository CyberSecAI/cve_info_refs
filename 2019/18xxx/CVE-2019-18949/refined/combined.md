=================================== SSA 006 ====================================
Page settings applied in a counter-intuitive manner.
DETAILS
Under specific circumstances, SnowHaze would apply different page settings than
most users would expect.
IMPACT
Websites may be able to perform operations that the user intended to block.
FIX
The application of page settings has been reworked to provide more
understandable results.
AFFECTED VERSIONS
SnowHaze 3.1 is affected.
WORKAROUND
Apply additional care when setting up per-page policies with the affected
SnowHaze version.
RESOLUTION
Update to SnowHaze version 3.1.1 (released January 19, 2021) or newer.
SEVERITY
Medium

=================================== SSA 005 ====================================
DNS queries leaked with some OpenVPN clients.
DETAILS
A server misconfiguration causes a split tunnel with some OpenVPN clients.
IMPACT
Some DNS queries can be leaked to a third-party DNS server.
FIX
The server configuration has been updated.
RESOLUTION
Ensure that your OpenVPN connections were established on or after Aug 04, 2020.
SEVERITY

================================================================================
=================================== SSA 004 ====================================
Domain names in page settings truncated in the middle.
DETAILS
The page settings display the domain name of the page they affect. If it is too
long, the line is truncated. Versions of SnowHaze prior to 2.6.7 performed this
truncation in the middle of the domain name.
IMPACT
Since later domain name components are more important in determining who
controls a page, this can facilitate social engineering attacks by hiding
important information in favour of data often chosen to be misleading.
FIX
Domain names are now truncated at the beginning, ensuring that the more
important components remain visible.
AFFECTED VERSIONS
All versions of SnowHaze prior to 2.6.7 (released February 24, 2020) are
affected.
WORKAROUND
Manually check which site is open if the domain name is truncated in the page
settings.
RESOLUTION
Update to SnowHaze version 2.6.7 (released February 24, 2020) or newer.
SEVERITY
Medium

================================================================================
=================================== SSA 003 ====================================
Tab setting no longer applied to closed tabs.
DETAILS
Tabs which are closed are sometimes not immediately released in order to enable
undoing the closing of the tab. In such cases, the tab settings were not applied
to the tab properly.
IMPACT
A webpage loaded in a tab with more restrictive settings may take advantage of
more permissive global settings to perform a prohibited action.
FIX
This issue has been addressed by cancelling any activity in the tab immediately
upon it being closed.
AFFECTED VERSIONS
All SnowHaze versions from the introduction of tab closing undo (Version 1.1,
released December 22, 2016) through 2.6.6 (released October 24, 2019) are
affected.
WORKAROUND
Set 'Allow for' in the 'Undo Tab Closing' section of the 'SnowHaze' settings to
'0 sec' to disable the feature.
RESOLUTION
Update to SnowHaze version 2.6.7 (released February 24, 2020) or newer.
SEVERITY
Low

================================================================================
=================================== SSA 002 ====================================
Cancel button in dangerous site warning ignored.
DETAILS
Tapping the cancel button in the dangerous site warning alert would be treated
the same as tapping the continue button.
IMPACT
A user deciding to cancel a page load due to a dangerous site warning would fail
to prevent the page from being loaded.
FIX
Taps of the cancel button are now properly registered.
AFFECTED VERSIONS
All SnowHaze versions from the introduction of dangerous sites warnings (Version
2.0, released August 31, 2017) through 2.6.6 (released October 24, 2019) are
affected.
WORKAROUND
Manually navigate away from pages which trigger a dangerous site warning.
RESOLUTION
Update to SnowHaze version 2.6.7 (released February 24, 2020) or newer.
SEVERITY
Medium

=================================== SSA 001 ====================================
JavaScript blocking bypass when multiple sites use different per-site settings.
DETAILS
When visiting multiple websites with differing per-site settings for 'Allow
JavaScript,' the setting was sometimes applied too late. This could lead to
JavaScript being run on pages where JavaScript was supposed to be blocked.
IMPACT
A webpage may be able to execute JavaScript code even though 'Allow JavaScript'
is disabled. This does not require user interaction.
FIX
This issue has been addressed by more aggressive application of per-site
settings.
AFFECTED VERSIONS
All versions of SnowHaze prior to 2.6.6 (released October 24, 2019) are affected
when running on iOS 13.
CREDITS
Person / People wishing to remain unnamed.
RESOLUTION
Update to SnowHaze version 2.6.6 (released October 24, 2019) or newer.
SEVERITY
Medium
