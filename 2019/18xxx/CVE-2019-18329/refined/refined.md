- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow exists when processing crafted packets on port 5010/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service condition and potentially gain remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending specially crafted packets to port 5010/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Network access to the MS3000 Server.
