net: dsa: sja1105: Prevent leaking memoryIn sja1105\_static\_config\_upload, in two cases memory is leaked: when
static\_config\_buf\_prepare\_for\_upload fails and when sja1105\_inhibit\_tx
fails. In both cases config\_buf should be released.

9p/cache.c: Fix memory leak in v9fs\_cache\_session\_get\_cookie
commit 962a991c5de18452d6c429d99f3039387cf5cbb0 upstream.
v9fs\_cache\_session\_get\_cookie assigns a random cachetag to v9ses->cachetag,
if the cachetag is not assigned previously.
v9fs\_random\_cachetag allocates memory to v9ses->cachetag with kmalloc and uses
scnprintf to fill it up with a cachetag.
But if scnprintf fails, v9ses->cachetag is not freed in the current
code causing a memory leak.
Fix this by freeing v9ses->cachetag it v9fs\_random\_cachetag fails.

The testcase programs HV\_X64\_MSR\_STIMERn\_CONFIG/HV\_X64\_MSR\_STIMERn\_COUNT,
in addition, there is no lapic in the kernel, the counters value are small

timer interrupt into the guest through lapic in the kernel which triggers
the NULL deferencing. This patch fixes it by don't advertise direct mode
synthetic timers and discarding the inject when lapic is not in kernel.

kexec: bail out upon SIGKILL when allocating memory.
commit 7c3a6aedcd6aae0a32a527e68669f7dd667492d1 upstream.
syzbot found that a thread can stall for minutes inside kexec\_load() after
that thread was killed by SIGKILL [1]. It turned out that the reproducer
was trying to allocate 2408MB of memory using kimage\_alloc\_page() from
kimage\_load\_normal\_segment(). Let's check for SIGKILL before doing memory
allocation.

dm raid: fix updating of max\_discard\_sectors limit
commit c8156fc77d0796ba2618936dbb3084e769e916c1 upstream.
Unit of 'chunk\_size' is byte, instead of sector, so fix it by setting
the queue\_limits' max\_discard\_sectors to rs->md.chunk\_sectors. Also,
rename chunk\_size to chunk\_size\_bytes.
Without this fix, too big max\_discard\_sectors is applied on the request
queue of dm-raid, finally raid code has to split the bio again.
This re-split done by raid causes the following nested clone\_endio:
1) one big bio 'A' is submitted to dm queue, and served as the original
bio
2) one new bio 'B' is cloned from the original bio 'A', and .map()
is run on this bio of 'B', and B's original bio points to 'A'
3) raid code sees that 'B' is too big, and split 'B' and re-submit
the remainded part of 'B' to dm-raid queue via generic\_make\_request().
4) now dm will handle 'B' as new original bio, then allocate a new
clone bio of 'C' and run .map() on 'C'. Meantime C's original bio
points to 'B'.
5) suppose now 'C' is completed by raid directly, then the following
clone\_endio() is called recursively:
clone\_endio(C)
->clone\_endio(B) #B is original bio of 'C'
->bio\_endio(A)
'A' can be big enough to make hundreds of nested clone\_endio(), then
stack can be corrupted easily.

smack: use GFP\_NOFS while holding inode\_smack::smk\_lock
commit e5bfad3d7acc5702f32aafeb388362994f4d7bd0 upstream.
inode\_smack::smk\_lock is taken during smack\_d\_instantiate(), which is
called during a filesystem transaction when creating a file on ext4.
Therefore to avoid a deadlock, all code that takes this lock must use
GFP\_NOFS, to prevent memory reclaim from waiting for the filesystem
transaction to complete.

Smack: Don't ignore other bprm->unsafe flags if LSM\_UNSAFE\_PTRACE is set
commit 3675f052b43ba51b99b85b073c7070e083f3e6fb upstream.
There is a logic bug in the current smack\_bprm\_set\_creds():
If LSM\_UNSAFE\_PTRACE is set, but the ptrace state is deemed to be
acceptable (e.g. because the ptracer detached in the meantime), the other
->unsafe flags aren't checked. As far as I can tell, this means that
something like the following could work (but I haven't tested it):
- task A: create task B with fork()
- task B: set NO\_NEW\_PRIVS
- task B: install a seccomp filter that makes open() return 0 under some
conditions
- task B: replace fd 0 with a malicious library
- task A: attach to task B with PTRACE\_ATTACH
- task B: execve() a file with an SMACK64EXEC extended attribute
- task A: while task B is still in the middle of execve(), exit (which
destroys the ptrace relationship)
Make sure that if any flags other than LSM\_UNSAFE\_PTRACE are set in
bprm->unsafe, we reject the execve().

net: sched: taprio: Avoid division by zero on invalid link speed

The check in taprio\_set\_picos\_per\_byte is currently not robust enough
and will trigger this division by zero, due to e.g. PHYLINK not setting
kset->base.speed when there is no PHY connected:

Russell King points out that the ethtool API says zero is a valid return
value of \_\_ethtool\_get\_link\_ksettings:
\* If it is enabled then they are read-only; if the link
\* is up they represent the negotiated link mode; if the link is down,
\* the speed is 0, %SPEED\_UNKNOWN or the highest enabled speed and
\* @duplex is %DUPLEX\_UNKNOWN or the best enabled duplex mode.
So, it seems that taprio is not following the API... I'd suggest either
fixing taprio, or getting agreement to change the ethtool API.
The chosen path was to fix taprio.

Background: the switch only offers partial RX timestamps (24 bits) and
it is up to the driver to read the PTP clock to fill those timestamps up
to 64 bits. But the PTP clock readout needs to happen quickly enough (in
0.135 seconds, in fact), otherwise the PTP clock will wrap around 24
bits, condition which cannot be detected.
Looking at the 'max 134217731' value on output line 3, one can see that
in hex it is 0x8000003. Because the PTP clock resolution is 8 ns,
that means 0x1000000 in ticks, which is exactly 2^24. So indeed this is
a PTP clock wraparound, but the reason might be surprising.
What is going on is that sja1105\_tstamp\_reconstruct(priv, now, ts)
expects a "now" time that is later than the "ts" was snapshotted at.
This, of course, is obvious: we read the PTP time \_after\_ the partial RX
timestamp was received. However, the workqueue is processing frames from
a skb queue and reuses the same PTP time, read once at the beginning.
Normally the skb queue only contains one frame and all goes well. But
when the skb queue contains two frames, the second frame that gets
dequeued might have been partially timestamped by the RX MAC \_after\_ we
had read our PTP time initially.
The code was originally like that due to concerns that SPI access for
PTP time readout is a slow process, and we are time-constrained anyway
(aka: premature optimization). But some timing analysis reveals that the
time spent until the RX timestamp is completely reconstructed is 1 order
of magnitude lower than the 0.135 s deadline even under worst-case
conditions. So we can afford to read the PTP time for each frame in the
RX timestamping queue, which of course ensures that the full PTP time is
in the partial timestamp's future.

xen-netfront: do not use ~0U as error return value for xennet\_fill\_frags()
[ Upstream commit a761129e3625688310aecf26e1be9e98e85f8eb5 ]
xennet\_fill\_frags() uses ~0U as return value when the sk\_buff is not able
to cache extra fragments. This is incorrect because the return type of
xennet\_fill\_frags() is RING\_IDX and 0xffffffff is an expected value for
ring buffer index.
In the situation when the rsp\_cons is approaching 0xffffffff, the return
value of xennet\_fill\_frags() may become 0xffffffff which xennet\_poll() (the
caller) would regard as error. As a result, queue->rx.rsp\_cons is set
incorrectly because it is updated only when there is error. If there is no
error, xennet\_poll() would be responsible to update queue->rx.rsp\_cons.
Finally, queue->rx.rsp\_cons would point to the rx ring buffer entries whose
queue->rx\_skbs[i] and queue->grant\_rx\_ref[i] are already cleared to NULL.
This leads to NULL pointer access in the next iteration to process rx ring
buffer entries.
The symptom is similar to the one fixed in
commit 00b368502d18 ("xen-netfront: do not assume sk\_buff\_head list is
empty in error handling").
This patch changes the return type of xennet\_fill\_frags() to indicate
whether it is successful or failed. The queue->rx.rsp\_cons will be
always updated inside this function.

rds\_ibdev:ipaddr\_list and rds\_ibdev:conn\_list are initialized
after allocation some resources such as protection domain.
If allocation of such resources fail, then these uninitialized
variables are accessed in rds\_ib\_dev\_free() in failure path. This
can potentially crash the system. The code has been updated to
initialize these variables very early in the function.

udp: only do GSO if # of segs > 1
[ Upstream commit 4094871db1d65810acab3d57f6089aa39ef7f648 ]
Prior to this change an application sending <= 1MSS worth of data and
enabling UDP GSO would fail if the system had SW GSO enabled, but the
same send would succeed if HW GSO offload is enabled. In addition to this
inconsistency the error in the SW GSO case does not get back to the
application if sending out of a real device so the user is unaware of this
failure.
With this change we only perform GSO if the # of segments is > 1 even
if the application has enabled segmentation. I've also updated the
relevant udpgso selftests.

tcp: adjust rto\_base in retransmits\_timed\_out()

The cited commit exposed an old retransmits\_timed\_out() bug
which assumed it could call tcp\_model\_timeout() with
TCP\_RTO\_MIN as rto\_base for all states.
But flows in SYN\_SENT or SYN\_RECV state uses a different
RTO base (1 sec instead of 200 ms, unless BPF choses
another value)
This caused a reduction of SYN retransmits from 6 to 4 with
the default /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp\_syn\_retries value.

net: dsa: rtl8366: Check VLAN ID and not ports
[ Upstream commit e8521e53cca584ddf8ec4584d3c550a6c65f88c4 ]
There has been some confusion between the port number and
the VLAN ID in this driver. What we need to check for
validity is the VLAN ID, nothing else.
The current confusion came from assigning a few default
VLANs for default routing and we need to rewrite that
properly.
Instead of checking if the port number is a valid VLAN
ID, check the actual VLAN IDs passed in to the callback
one by one as expected.

tipc: fix unlimited bundling of small messages
[ Upstream commit e95584a889e1902fdf1ded9712e2c3c3083baf96 ]
We have identified a problem with the "oversubscription" policy in the
link transmission code.
When small messages are transmitted, and the sending link has reached
the transmit window limit, those messages will be bundled and put into
the link backlog queue. However, bundles of data messages are counted
at the 'CRITICAL' level, so that the counter for that level, instead of
the counter for the real, bundled message's level is the one being
increased.
Subsequent, to-be-bundled data messages at non-CRITICAL levels continue
to be tested against the unchanged counter for their own level, while
contributing to an unrestrained increase at the CRITICAL backlog level.
This leaves a gap in congestion control algorithm for small messages
that can result in starvation for other users or a "real" CRITICAL
user. Even that eventually can lead to buffer exhaustion & link reset.
We fix this by keeping a 'target\_bskb' buffer pointer at each levels,
then when bundling, we only bundle messages at the same importance
level only. This way, we know exactly how many slots a certain level
have occupied in the queue, so can manage level congestion accurately.
By bundling messages at the same level, we even have more benefits. Let
consider this:
- One socket sends 64-byte messages at the 'CRITICAL' level;
- Another sends 4096-byte messages at the 'LOW' level;
When a 64-byte message comes and is bundled the first time, we put the
overhead of message bundle to it (+ 40-byte header, data copy, etc.)
for later use, but the next message can be a 4096-byte one that cannot
be bundled to the previous one. This means the last bundle carries only
one payload message which is totally inefficient, as for the receiver
also! Later on, another 64-byte message comes, now we make a new bundle
and the same story repeats...
With the new bundling algorithm, this will not happen, the 64-byte
messages will be bundled together even when the 4096-byte message(s)
comes in between. However, if the 4096-byte messages are sent at the
same level i.e. 'CRITICAL', the bundling algorithm will again cause the
same overhead.
Also, the same will happen even with only one socket sending small
messages at a rate close to the link transmit's one, so that, when one
message is bundled, it's transmitted shortly. Then, another message
comes, a new bundle is created and so on...
We will solve this issue radically by another patch.

net: Unpublish sk from sk\_reuseport\_cb before call\_rcu
[ Upstream commit 8c7138b33e5c690c308b2a7085f6313fdcb3f616 ]
The "reuse->sock[]" array is shared by multiple sockets. The going away
sk must unpublish itself from "reuse->sock[]" before making call\_rcu()
call. However, this unpublish-action is currently done after a grace
period and it may cause use-after-free.
The fix is to move reuseport\_detach\_sock() to sk\_destruct().
Due to the above reason, any socket with sk\_reuseport\_cb has
to go through the rcu grace period before freeing it.
It is a rather old bug (~3 yrs). The Fixes tag is not necessary
the right commit but it is the one that introduced the SOCK\_RCU\_FREE
logic and this fix is depending on it.

net: ipv4: avoid mixed n\_redirects and rate\_tokens usage
[ Upstream commit b406472b5ad79ede8d10077f0c8f05505ace8b6d ]
Since commit c09551c6ff7f ("net: ipv4: use a dedicated counter
for icmp\_v4 redirect packets") we use 'n\_redirects' to account
for redirect packets, but we still use 'rate\_tokens' to compute
the redirect packets exponential backoff.
If the device sent to the relevant peer any ICMP error packet
after sending a redirect, it will also update 'rate\_token' according
to the leaking bucket schema; typically 'rate\_token' will raise
above BITS\_PER\_LONG and the redirect packets backoff algorithm
will produce undefined behavior.
Fix the issue using 'n\_redirects' to compute the exponential backoff
in ip\_rt\_send\_redirect().
Note that we still clear rate\_tokens after a redirect silence period,
to avoid changing an established behaviour.
The root cause predates git history; before the mentioned commit in
the critical scenario, the kernel stopped sending redirects, after
the mentioned commit the behavior more randomic.

addrconf\_dad\_work is kicked to be scheduled when a device is brought
up. There is a race between addrcond\_dad\_work getting scheduled and
taking the rtnl lock and a process taking the link down (under rtnl).
The latter removes the host route from the inet6\_addr as part of
addrconf\_ifdown which is run for NETDEV\_DOWN. The former attempts
to use the host route in \_\_ipv6\_ifa\_notify. If the down event removes
the host route due to the race to the rtnl, then the BUG listed above
occurs.
Since the DAD sequence can not be aborted, add a check for the missing
host route in \_\_ipv6\_ifa\_notify. The only way this should happen is due
to the previously mentioned race. The host route is created when the
address is added to an interface; it is only removed on a down event
where the address is kept. Add a warning if the host route is missing
AND the device is up; this is a situation that should never happen.

ipv6: drop incoming packets having a v4mapped source address
[ Upstream commit 6af1799aaf3f1bc8defedddfa00df3192445bbf3 ]
This began with a syzbot report. syzkaller was injecting
IPv6 TCP SYN packets having a v4mapped source address.
After an unsuccessful 4-tuple lookup, TCP creates a request
socket (SYN\_RECV) and calls reqsk\_queue\_hash\_req()
reqsk\_queue\_hash\_req() calls sk\_ehashfn(sk)
At this point we have AF\_INET6 sockets, and the heuristic
used by sk\_ehashfn() to either hash the IPv4 or IPv6 addresses
is to use ipv6\_addr\_v4mapped(&sk->sk\_v6\_daddr)
For the particular spoofed packet, we end up hashing V4 addresses
which were not initialized by the TCP IPv6 stack, so KMSAN fired
a warning.
I first fixed sk\_ehashfn() to test both source and destination addresses,
but then faced various problems, including user-space programs
like packetdrill that had similar assumptions.
Instead of trying to fix the whole ecosystem, it is better
to admit that we have a dual stack behavior, and that we
can not build linux kernels without V4 stack anyway.
The dual stack API automatically forces the traffic to be IPv4
if v4mapped addresses are used at bind() or connect(), so it makes
no sense to allow IPv6 traffic to use the same v4mapped class.

The current default value (400) is too low on many systems (e.g. some
ARM64 platform takes up 1000+ entries).
syzbot uses 16000 as default value, and has proved to be enough on beefy
configurations, so let's pick that value.
This consumes more RAM on boot (each entry is 160 bytes, so in total
~2.5MB of RAM), but the memory would later be freed (early\_log is
\_\_initdata).

ocfs2: wait for recovering done after direct unlock request
[ Upstream commit 0a3775e4f883912944481cf2ef36eb6383a9cc74 ]
There is a scenario causing ocfs2 umount hang when multiple hosts are
rebooting at the same time.
NODE1 NODE2 NODE3
send unlock requset to NODE2
dies
become recovery master
recover NODE2
find NODE2 dead
mark resource RECOVERING
directly remove lock from grant list
calculate usage but RECOVERING marked
\*\*miss the window of purging
clear RECOVERING
To reproduce this issue, crash a host and then umount ocfs2
from another node.
To solve this, just let unlock progress wait for recovery done.

kbuild: clean compressed initramfs image
[ Upstream commit 6279eb3dd7946c69346a3b98473ed13d3a44adb5 ]
Since 9e3596b0c653 ("kbuild: initramfs cleanup, set target from Kconfig")
"make clean" leaves behind compressed initramfs images. Example:
$ make defconfig
$ sed -i 's|CONFIG\_INITRAMFS\_SOURCE=""|CONFIG\_INITRAMFS\_SOURCE="/tmp/ir.cpio"|' .config
$ make olddefconfig
$ make -s
$ make -s clean
$ git clean -ndxf | grep initramfs
Would remove usr/initramfs\_data.cpio.gz
clean rules do not have CONFIG\_\* context so they do not know which
compression format was used. Thus they don't know which files to delete.
Tell clean to delete all possible compression formats.
Once patched usr/initramfs\_data.cpio.gz and friends are deleted by
"make clean".

mm: add dummy can\_do\_mlock() helper

On kernels without CONFIG\_MMU, we get a link error for the siw driver:

This is probably not the only driver that needs the function and could
otherwise build correctly without CONFIG\_MMU, so add a dummy variant that
always returns false.

crypto: hisilicon - Fix double free in sec\_free\_hw\_sgl()
[ Upstream commit 24fbf7bad888767bed952f540ac963bc57e47e15 ]
There are two problems in sec\_free\_hw\_sgl():
First, when sgl\_current->next is valid, @hw\_sgl will be freed in the
first loop, but it free again after the loop.
Second, sgl\_current and sgl\_current->next\_sgl is not match when
dma\_pool\_free() is invoked, the third parameter should be the dma
address of sgl\_current, but sgl\_current->next\_sgl is the dma address
of next chain, so use sgl\_current->next\_sgl is wrong.
Fix this by deleting the last dma\_pool\_free() in sec\_free\_hw\_sgl(),
modifying the condition for while loop, and matching the address for
dma\_pool\_free().

fat: work around race with userspace's read via blockdev while mounting
[ Upstream commit 07bfa4415ab607e459b69bd86aa7e7602ce10b4f ]
If userspace reads the buffer via blockdev while mounting,
sb\_getblk()+modify can race with buffer read via blockdev.
For example,
FS userspace
bh = sb\_getblk()
modify bh->b\_data
read
ll\_rw\_block(bh)
fill bh->b\_data by on-disk data
/\* lost modified data by FS \*/
set\_buffer\_uptodate(bh)
set\_buffer\_uptodate(bh)
Userspace should not use the blockdev while mounting though, the udev
seems to be already doing this. Although I think the udev should try to
avoid this, workaround the race by small overhead.

If equal to 0, the injection limit for a bfq\_queue is pushed to 1

The problem is that the Tegra PCIe driver indirectly uses I2C for
controlling some regulators and the I2C driver is now being suspended
before the PCIe driver causing the PCIe suspend to fail. The Tegra PCIe
driver is suspended during the NOIRQ phase and this cannot be changed
due to other dependencies. Therefore, we also need to move the suspend
handling for the Tegra I2C driver to the NOIRQ phase as well.
In order to move the I2C suspend handling to the NOIRQ phase we also
need to avoid calling pm\_runtime\_get/put() because per commit
1e2ef05bb8cf ("PM: Limit race conditions between runtime PM and system
sleep (v2)") these cannot be called early in resume. The function
tegra\_i2c\_init(), called during resume, calls pm\_runtime\_get/put() and
so move these calls outside of tegra\_i2c\_init(), so this function can
be used during the NOIRQ resume phase.

ARM: 8903/1: ensure that usable memory in bank 0 starts from a PMD-aligned address
[ Upstream commit 00d2ec1e6bd82c0538e6dd3e4a4040de93ba4fef ]
The calculation of memblock\_limit in adjust\_lowmem\_bounds() assumes that
bank 0 starts from a PMD-aligned address. However, the beginning of the
first bank may be NOMAP memory and the start of usable memory
will be not aligned to PMD boundary. In such case the memblock\_limit will
be set to the end of the NOMAP region, which will prevent any memblock
allocations.
Mark the region between the end of the NOMAP area and the next PMD-aligned
address as NOMAP as well, so that the usable memory will start at
PMD-aligned address.

clang can emit a working mcount symbol, \_\_gnu\_mcount\_nc, when
'-meabi gnu' is passed to it. Until r369147 in LLVM, this was
broken and caused the kernel not to boot with '-pg' because the
calling convention was not correct. Always build with '-meabi gnu'
when using clang but ensure that '-pg' (which is added with
CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_TRACER and its prereq CONFIG\_HAVE\_FUNCTION\_TRACER)
cannot be added with it unless this is fixed (which means using
clang 10.0.0 and newer).

on line 3920 to check whether skb is NULL:
if (skb && skb->secmark != 0)
This check indicates skb can be NULL in some cases.
But on lines 3931 and 3932, skb is used:
ad.a.u.net->netif = skb->skb\_iif;
ipv6\_skb\_to\_auditdata(skb, &ad.a, NULL);
Thus, possible null-pointer dereferences may occur when skb is NULL.
To fix these possible bugs, an if statement is added to check skb.
These bugs are found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.

PCI: exynos: Propagate errors for optional PHYs
[ Upstream commit ddd6960087d4b45759434146d681a94bbb1c54ad ]
devm\_of\_phy\_get() can fail for a number of reasons besides probe
deferral. It can for example return -ENOMEM if it runs out of memory as
it tries to allocate devres structures. Propagating only -EPROBE\_DEFER
is problematic because it results in these legitimately fatal errors
being treated as "PHY not specified in DT".
What we really want is to ignore the optional PHYs only if they have not
been specified in DT. devm\_of\_phy\_get() returns -ENODEV in this case, so
that's the special case that we need to handle. So we propagate all
errors, except -ENODEV, so that real failures will still cause the
driver to fail probe.

power: supply: register HWMON devices with valid names
[ Upstream commit f1b937cc86bedf94dbc3478c2c0dc79471081fff ]
With the introduction of the HWMON compatibility layer to the power
supply framework in Linux 5.3, all power supply devices' names can be
used directly to create HWMON devices with the same names.
But HWMON has rules on allowable names that are different from those
used in the power supply framework. The dash character is forbidden, as
it is used by the libsensors library in userspace as a separator,
whereas this character is used in the device names in more than half of
the existing power supply drivers. This last case is consistent with the
typical naming usage with MFD and Device Tree.
This leads to warnings in the kernel log, with the format:
power\_supply gpio-charger: hwmon: \
'gpio-charger' is not a valid name attribute, please fix
Add a protection to power\_supply\_add\_hwmon\_sysfs() that replaces any
dash in the device name with an underscore when registering with the
HWMON framework. Other forbidden characters (star, slash, space, tab,
newline) are not replaced, as they are not in common use.

[ Upstream commit 7ef66122bdb3b839e9f51b76d7e600b6e21ef648 ]
Issue:
- # hwclock -w
hwclock: RTC\_SET\_TIME: Invalid argument
Why:
- Relative commit: 8b9f9d4dc511 ("regmap: verify if register is
writeable before writing operations"), this patch
will always check for unwritable registers, it will compare reg
with max\_register in regmap\_writeable.
- The pcf85363/pcf85263 has the capability of address wrapping
which means if you access an address outside the allowed range
(0x00-0x2f) hardware actually wraps the access to a lower address.
The rtc-pcf85363 driver will use this feature to configure the time
and execute 2 actions in the same i2c write operation (stopping the
clock and configure the time). However the driver has also
configured the `regmap maxregister` protection mechanism that will
block accessing addresses outside valid range (0x00-0x2f).
How:
- Split of writing regs to two parts, first part writes control
registers about stop\_enable and resets, second part writes
RTC time and date registers.

PCI: mobiveil: Fix the CPU base address setup in inbound window

Current code erroneously sets-up the CPU base address through the
parameter 'pci\_addr', which is passed to initialize the CPU (AXI) base
address of the inbound window where the controller maps the PCI address
space into CPU physical address space; furthermore, it also truncates it
by programming only the lower 32-bit value into the inbound CPU address
register.
Fix both issues by introducing a new parameter 'u64 cpu\_addr' to
initialize both lower 32-bit and upper 32-bit of the CPU physical
base address mapping PCI inbound transactions into CPU (AXI) ones.

ARM: 8898/1: mm: Don't treat faults reported from cache maintenance as writes
[ Upstream commit 834020366da9ab3fb87d1eb9a3160eb22dbed63a ]
Translation faults arising from cache maintenance instructions are
rather unhelpfully reported with an FSR value where the WnR field is set
to 1, indicating that the faulting access was a write. Since cache
maintenance instructions on 32-bit ARM do not require any particular
permissions, this can cause our private 'cacheflush' system call to fail
spuriously if a translation fault is generated due to page aging when
targetting a read-only VMA.
In this situation, we will return -EFAULT to userspace, although this is
unfortunately suppressed by the popular '\_\_builtin\_\_\_clear\_cache()'
intrinsic provided by GCC, which returns void.
Although it's tempting to write this off as a userspace issue, we can
actually do a little bit better on CPUs that support LPAE, even if the
short-descriptor format is in use. On these CPUs, cache maintenance
faults additionally set the CM field in the FSR, which we can use to
suppress the write permission checks in the page fault handler and
succeed in performing cache maintenance to read-only areas even in the
presence of a translation fault.

mips/atomic: Fix smp\_mb\_\_{before,after}\_atomic()
[ Upstream commit 42344113ba7a1ed7b5654cd5270af0d5698d8521 ]
Recent probing at the Linux Kernel Memory Model uncovered a
'surprise'. Strongly ordered architectures where the atomic RmW
primitive implies full memory ordering and
smp\_mb\_\_{before,after}\_atomic() are a simple barrier() (such as MIPS
without WEAK\_REORDERING\_BEYOND\_LLSC) fail for:
\*x = 1;
atomic\_inc(u);
smp\_mb\_\_after\_atomic();
r0 = \*y;
Because, while the atomic\_inc() implies memory order, it
(surprisingly) does not provide a compiler barrier. This then allows
the compiler to re-order like so:
atomic\_inc(u);
\*x = 1;
smp\_mb\_\_after\_atomic();
r0 = \*y;
Which the CPU is then allowed to re-order (under TSO rules) like:
atomic\_inc(u);
r0 = \*y;
\*x = 1;
And this very much was not intended. Therefore strengthen the atomic
RmW ops to include a compiler barrier.

barriers from cmpxchg() because cmpxchg\_local() is implemented with

of\_node\_put() is missing thus causing a reference leak.
Hence stash these mid-loop return values in a variable 'err' and add a
new label err\_node\_put which executes of\_node\_put() on the previous node
and returns 'err' on failure.
Change mid-loop return statements to point to jump to this label to
fix the reference leak.
Issue found with Coccinelle.

mfd: intel-lpss: Remove D3cold delay
[ Upstream commit 76380a607ba0b28627c9b4b55cd47a079a59624b ]
Goodix touchpad may drop its first couple input events when
i2c-designware-platdrv and intel-lpss it connects to took too long to
runtime resume from runtime suspended state.
This issue happens becuase the touchpad has a rather small buffer to
store up to 13 input events, so if the host doesn't read those events in
time (i.e. runtime resume takes too long), events are dropped from the
touchpad's buffer.
The bottleneck is D3cold delay it waits when transitioning from D3cold
to D0, hence remove the delay to make the resume faster. I've tested
some systems with intel-lpss and haven't seen any regression.

\*\*\* DEADLOCK \*\*\*
The problem is that the CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC's builtin i2c-adapter is
itself a part of an i2c-client (the PMIC). This means that transfers done
through it take adapter->bus\_lock twice, once for the parent i2c-adapter
and once for its own bus\_lock. Lockdep does not like this nested locking.
To make lockdep happy in the case of busses with muxes, the i2c-core's
i2c\_adapter\_lock\_bus function calls:
rt\_mutex\_lock\_nested(&adapter->bus\_lock, i2c\_adapter\_depth(adapter));
But i2c\_adapter\_depth only works when the direct parent of the adapter is
another adapter, as it is only meant for muxes. In this case there is an
i2c-client and MFD instantiated platform\_device in the parent->child chain
between the 2 devices.
This commit overrides the default i2c\_lock\_operations, passing a hardcoded
depth of 1 to rt\_mutex\_lock\_nested, making lockdep happy.
Note that if there were to be a mux attached to the i2c-wc-cht adapter,
this would break things again since the i2c-mux code expects the
root-adapter to have a locking depth of 0. But the i2c-wc-cht adapter
always has only 1 client directly attached in the form of the charger IC
paired with the CHT Whiskey Cove PMIC.

ext4: fix potential use after free after remounting with noblock\_validity
[ Upstream commit 7727ae52975d4f4ef7ff69ed8e6e25f6a4168158 ]
Remount process will release system zone which was allocated before if
"noblock\_validity" is specified. If we mount an ext4 file system to two
mountpoints with default mount options, and then remount one of them
with "noblock\_validity", it may trigger a use after free problem when
someone accessing the other one.
# mount /dev/sda foo
# mount /dev/sda bar
User access mountpoint "foo" | Remount mountpoint "bar"
|
ext4\_map\_blocks() | ext4\_remount()
check\_block\_validity() | ext4\_setup\_system\_zone()
ext4\_data\_block\_valid() | ext4\_release\_system\_zone()
| free system\_blks rb nodes
access system\_blks rb nodes |
trigger use after free |
This problem can also be reproduced by one mountpint, At the same time,
add\_system\_zone() can get called during remount as well so there can be
racing ext4\_data\_block\_valid() reading the rbtree at the same time.
This patch add RCU to protect system zone from releasing or building
when doing a remount which inverse current "noblock\_validity" mount
option. It assign the rbtree after the whole tree was complete and
do actual freeing after rcu grace period, avoid any intermediate state.

f2fs: fix to drop meta/node pages during umount

As reported in bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show\_bug.cgi?id=204193
A null pointer dereference bug is triggered in f2fs under kernel-5.1.3.

call\_function\_single\_interrupt+0xf/0x20
During umount, we will access NULL sbi->node\_inode pointer in
f2fs\_write\_end\_io():
f2fs\_bug\_on(sbi, page->mapping == NODE\_MAPPING(sbi) &&
page->index != nid\_of\_node(page));
The reason is if disable\_checkpoint mount option is on, meta dirty
pages can remain during umount, and then be flushed by iput() of
meta\_inode, however node\_inode has been iput()ed before
meta\_inode's iput().
Since checkpoint is disabled, all meta/node datas are useless and
should be dropped in next mount, so in umount, let's adjust
drop\_inode() to give a hint to iput\_final() to drop all those dirty
datas correctly.

dma-buf/sw\_sync: Synchronize signal vs syncpt free
[ Upstream commit d3c6dd1fb30d3853c2012549affe75c930f4a2f9 ]
During release of the syncpt, we remove it from the list of syncpt and
the tree, but only if it is not already been removed. However, during
signaling, we first remove the syncpt from the list. So, if we
concurrently free and signal the syncpt, the free may decide that it is
not part of the tree and immediately free itself -- meanwhile the
signaler goes on to use the now freed datastructure.
In particular, we get struck by commit 0e2f733addbf ("dma-buf: make
dma\_fence structure a bit smaller v2") as the cb\_list is immediately
clobbered by the kfree\_rcu.

through the oops path"), pstore dmesg file is not updated when dump is
triggered from HMC. This commit modified system reset (sreset) handler
to invoke fadump or kdump (if configured), without pushing dmesg to
pstore. This leaves pstore to have old dmesg data which won't be much
of a help if kdump fails to capture the dump. This patch fixes that by
calling kmsg\_dump() before heading to fadump ot kdump.

clk: Make clk\_bulk\_get\_all() return a valid "id"
[ Upstream commit 7f81c2426587b34bf73e643c1a6d080dfa14cf8a ]
The adreno driver expects the "id" field of the returned clk\_bulk\_data
to be filled in with strings from the clock-names property.
But due to the use of kmalloc\_array() in of\_clk\_bulk\_get\_all() it
receives a list of bogus pointers instead.
Zero-initialize the "id" field and attempt to populate with strings from
the clock-names property to resolve both these issues.

clk: imx: clk-pll14xx: unbypass PLL by default
[ Upstream commit a9aa8306074d9519dd6e5fdf07240b01bac72e04 ]
When registering the PLL, unbypass the PLL.
The PLL has two bypass control bit, BYPASS and EXT\_BYPASS.
we will expose EXT\_BYPASS to clk driver for mux usage, and keep
BYPASS inside pll14xx usage. The PLL has a restriction that
when M/P change, need to RESET/BYPASS pll to avoid glitch, so
we could not expose BYPASS.
To make it easy for clk driver usage, unbypass PLL which does
not hurt current function.

[ Upstream commit dee1bc9c23cd41fe32549c0adbe6cb57cab02282 ]
According to PLL1443XA and PLL1416X spec,
"When BYPASS is 0 and RESETB is changed from 0 to 1, FOUT starts to
output unstable clock until lock time passes. PLL1416X/PLL1443XA may
generate a glitch at FOUT."
So set BYPASS when RESETB is changed from 0 to 1 to avoid glitch.
In the end of set rate, BYPASS will be cleared.
When prepare clock, also need to take care to avoid glitch. So
we also follow Spec to set BYPASS before RESETB changed from 0 to 1.
And add a check if the RESETB is already 0, directly return 0;

Selecting the right parent for the main clock is done using only

In case we have this oscillator bypassed by an external signal (no driving
on the XOUT line), we still use external clock, but with BYPASS bit set.
So, in this case we must select the same parent as before.

ARM: dts: dir685: Drop spi-cpol from the display
[ Upstream commit 2a7326caab479ca257c4b9bd67db42d1d49079bf ]
The D-Link DIR-685 had its clock polarity set as active
low using the special SPI "spi-cpol" property.
This is not correct: the datasheet clearly states:
"Fix SCL to GND level when not in use" which is
indicative that this line is active high.
After a recent fix making the GPIO-based SPI driver
force the clock line de-asserted at the beginning of
each SPI transaction this reared its ugly head: now
de-asserted was taken to mean the line should be
driven high, but it should be driven low.
Fix this up in the DTS file and the display works again.

powerpc/pseries: correctly track irq state in default idle

this include:

online operation block indefinitely waiting for the new cpu to
respond.
\* Hitting this WARN\_ON in arch\_local\_irq\_restore():

\* We should already be hard disabled here. We had bugs
\* where that wasn't the case so let's dbl check it and
\* warn if we are wrong. Only do that when IRQ tracing

[ Upstream commit 5e4b7e82d497580bc430576c4c9bce157dd72512 ]
Some MMC cards fail to enumerate properly when inserted into an MMC slot
on sdm845 devices. This is because the clk ops for qcom clks round the
frequency up to the nearest rate instead of down to the nearest rate.
For example, the MMC driver requests a frequency of 52MHz from
clk\_set\_rate() but the qcom implementation for these clks rounds 52MHz
up to the next supported frequency of 100MHz. The MMC driver could be
modified to request clk rate ranges but for now we can fix this in the
clk driver by changing the rounding policy for this clk to be round down
instead of round up.

powerpc/eeh: Clean up EEH PEs after recovery finishes

When the last device in an eeh\_pe is removed the eeh\_pe structure itself
(and any empty parents) are freed since they are no longer needed. This
results in a crash when a hotplug driver is involved since the following
may occur:
1. Device is suprise removed.
2. Driver performs an MMIO, which fails and queues and eeh\_event.
3. Hotplug driver receives a hotplug interrupt and removes any
pci\_devs that were under the slot.
4. pci\_dev is torn down and the eeh\_pe is freed.
5. The EEH event handler thread processes the eeh\_event and crashes
since the eeh\_pe pointer in the eeh\_event structure is no
longer valid.
Crashing is generally considered poor form. Instead of doing that use
the fact PEs are marked as EEH\_PE\_INVALID to keep them around until the
end of the recovery cycle, at which point we can safely prune any empty
PEs.

The main handler runs exactly as a normal interrupt handler, after the

kbuild: Do not enable -Wimplicit-fallthrough for clang for now
[ Upstream commit e2079e93f562c7f7a030eb7642017ee5eabaaa10 ]
This functionally reverts commit bfd77145f35c ("Makefile: Convert
-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3 to just -Wimplicit-fallthrough for clang").
clang enabled support for -Wimplicit-fallthrough in C in r369414 [1],
which causes a lot of warnings when building the kernel for two reasons:
1. Clang does not support the /\* fall through \*/ comments. There seems
to be a general consensus in the LLVM community that this is not
something they want to support. Joe Perches wrote a script to convert
all of the comments to a "fallthrough" keyword that will be added to
compiler\_attributes.h [2] [3], which catches the vast majority of the
comments. There doesn't appear to be any consensus in the kernel
community when to do this conversion.
2. Clang and GCC disagree about falling through to final case statements
with no content or cases that simply break:
https://godbolt.org/z/c8csDu
This difference contributes at least 50 warnings in an allyesconfig
build for x86, not considering other architectures. This difference
will need to be discussed to see which compiler is right [4] [5].

Given these two problems need discussion and coordination, do not enable

what is going on as well. This commit should be reverted once these two
issues are fully flushed out and resolved.

The CPG/MSSR Clock Domain driver does not implement the

cannot be powered down. Hence the domain should be marked as always-on

Note that this only affects RZ/A2 SoCs. On R-Car Gen2 and Gen3 SoCs,

[ Upstream commit a459a184c978ca9ad538aab93aafdde873953f30 ]
The CPG/MSTP Clock Domain driver does not implement the
generic\_pm\_domain.power\_{on,off}() callbacks, as the domain itself
cannot be powered down. Hence the domain should be marked as always-on
by setting the GENPD\_FLAG\_ALWAYS\_ON flag, to prevent the core PM Domain
code from considering it for power-off, and doing unnessary processing.
This also gets rid of a boot warning when the Clock Domain contains an
IRQ-safe device, e.g. on RZ/A1:
sh\_mtu2 fcff0000.timer: PM domain cpg\_clocks will not be powered off

pinctrl: amd: disable spurious-firing GPIO IRQs
[ Upstream commit d21b8adbd475dba19ac2086d3306327b4a297418 ]
When cold-booting Asus X434DA, GPIO 7 is found to be already configured
as an interrupt, and the GPIO level is found to be in a state that
causes the interrupt to fire.
As soon as pinctrl-amd probes, this interrupt fires and invokes
amd\_gpio\_irq\_handler(). The IRQ is acked, but no GPIO-IRQ handler was
invoked, so the GPIO level being unchanged just causes another interrupt
to fire again immediately after.
This results in an interrupt storm causing this platform to hang
during boot, right after pinctrl-amd is probed.
Detect this situation and disable the GPIO interrupt when this happens.
This enables the affected platform to boot as normal. GPIO 7 actually is
the I2C touchpad interrupt line, and later on, i2c-multitouch loads and
re-enables this interrupt when it is ready to handle it.
Instead of this approach, I considered disabling all GPIO interrupts at
probe time, however that seems a little risky, and I also confirmed that
Windows does not seem to have this behaviour: the same 41 GPIO IRQs are
enabled under both Linux and Windows, which is a far larger collection
than the GPIOs referenced by the DSDT on this platform.

When changing this value Nvidia driver still appeared to ignore it, and I wasn't able to find out why, thus the code is ignoring the value if it is zero.

powerpc/eeh: Clear stale EEH\_DEV\_NO\_HANDLER flag
[ Upstream commit aa06e3d60e245284d1e55497eb3108828092818d ]
The EEH\_DEV\_NO\_HANDLER flag is used by the EEH system to prevent the
use of driver callbacks in drivers that have been bound part way
through the recovery process. This is necessary to prevent later stage
handlers from being called when the earlier stage handlers haven't,
which can be confusing for drivers.
However, the flag is set for all devices that are added after boot
time and only cleared at the end of the EEH recovery process. This
results in hot plugged devices erroneously having the flag set during
the first recovery after they are added (causing their driver's
handlers to be incorrectly ignored).
To remedy this, clear the flag at the beginning of recovery
processing. The flag is still cleared at the end of recovery
processing, although it is no longer really necessary.
Also clear the flag during eeh\_handle\_special\_event(), for the same
reasons.

powerpc/64s/radix: Fix memory hotplug section page table creation

create\_physical\_mapping expects physical addresses, but creating and
splitting these mappings after boot is supplying virtual (effective)
addresses. This can be irritated by booting with mem= to limit memory
then probing an unused physical memory range:
echo  > /sys/devices/system/memory/probe
This mostly works by accident, firstly because \_\_va(\_\_va(x)) == \_\_va(x)
so the virtual address does not get corrupted. Secondly because pfn\_pte
masks out the upper bits of the pfn beyond the physical address limit,
so a pfn constructed with a 0xc000000000000000 virtual linear address
will be masked back to the correct physical address in the pte.

powerpc/rtas: use device model APIs and serialization during LPM
[ Upstream commit a6717c01ddc259f6f73364779df058e2c67309f8 ]
The LPAR migration implementation and userspace-initiated cpu hotplug
can interleave their executions like so:
1. Set cpu 7 offline via sysfs.
2. Begin a partition migration, whose implementation requires the OS
to ensure all present cpus are online; cpu 7 is onlined:
rtas\_ibm\_suspend\_me -> rtas\_online\_cpus\_mask -> cpu\_up
This sets cpu 7 online in all respects except for the cpu's
corresponding struct device; dev->offline remains true.
3. Set cpu 7 online via sysfs. \_cpu\_up() determines that cpu 7 is
already online and returns success. The driver core (device\_online)
sets dev->offline = false.
4. The migration completes and restores cpu 7 to offline state:
rtas\_ibm\_suspend\_me -> rtas\_offline\_cpus\_mask -> cpu\_down
This leaves cpu7 in a state where the driver core considers the cpu
device online, but in all other respects it is offline and
unused. Attempts to online the cpu via sysfs appear to succeed but the
driver core actually does not pass the request to the lower-level
cpuhp support code. This makes the cpu unusable until the cpu device
is manually set offline and then online again via sysfs.
Instead of directly calling cpu\_up/cpu\_down, the migration code should
use the higher-level device core APIs to maintain consistent state and
serialize operations.

powerpc/powernv/ioda2: Allocate TCE table levels on demand for default DMA window
[ Upstream commit c37c792dec0929dbb6360a609fb00fa20bb16fc2 ]
We allocate only the first level of multilevel TCE tables for KVM
already (alloc\_userspace\_copy==true), and the rest is allocated on demand.
This is not enabled though for bare metal.
This removes the KVM limitation (implicit, via the alloc\_userspace\_copy
parameter) and always allocates just the first level. The on-demand
allocation of missing levels is already implemented.
As from now on DMA map might happen with disabled interrupts, this
allocates TCEs with GFP\_ATOMIC; otherwise lockdep reports errors 1].
In practice just a single page is allocated there so chances for failure
are quite low.
To save time when creating a new clean table, this skips non-allocated
indirect TCE entries in pnv\_tce\_free just like we already do in
the VFIO IOMMU TCE driver.
This changes the default level number from 1 to 2 to reduce the amount
of memory required for the default 32bit DMA window at the boot time.
The default window size is up to 2GB which requires 4MB of TCEs which is
unlikely to be used entirely or at all as most devices these days are
64bit capable so by switching to 2 levels by default we save 4032KB of
RAM per a device.
While at this, add \_\_GFP\_NOWARN to alloc\_pages\_node() as the userspace
can trigger this path via VFIO, see the failure and try creating a table
again with different parameters which might succeed.

drm/amd/display: Register VUPDATE\_NO\_LOCK interrupts for DCN2
[ Upstream commit e40837afb9b011757e17e9f71d97853ca574bcff ]
[Why]
These are needed to send back DRM vblank events in the case where VRR
is on. Without the interrupt enabled we're deferring the events into the
vblank queue and userspace is left waiting forever to get back the
events they need.
Found using igt@kms\_vrr - the test fails immediately due to vblank
timeout.
[How]
Register them the same way we're handling it for DCN1.
This fixes igt@kms\_vrr for DCN2.

[Why]
The math on deciding on how many

Also integer overflow can occur if we have high refresh rates.
[How]
Instead of clipping the frame duration such that it doesn’t go below the min,
just remove a frame from the number of frames to insert. +
Use unsigned long long for intermediate calculations to prevent
integer overflow.

The code was setting the bit 21 of the CPCCR register to use a divider
of 2 for the "pll half" clock, and clearing the bit to use a divider
of 1.
This is the opposite of how this register field works: a cleared bit
means that the /2 divider is used, and a set bit means that the divider
is 1.
Restore the correct behaviour using the newly introduced .div\_table
field.

ipmi\_si: Only schedule continuously in the thread in maintenance mode
[ Upstream commit 340ff31ab00bca5c15915e70ad9ada3030c98cf8 ]
ipmi\_thread() uses back-to-back schedule() to poll for command
completion which, on some machines, can push up CPU consumption and
heavily tax the scheduler locks leading to noticeable overall
performance degradation.
This was originally added so firmware updates through IPMI would
complete in a timely manner. But we can't kill the scheduler
locks for that one use case.
Instead, only run schedule() continuously in maintenance mode,
where firmware updates should run.

clk: imx8mq: Mark AHB clock as critical
[ Upstream commit 9b9c60bed562c3718ae324a86f3f30a4ff983cf8 ]
Initially, the TMU\_ROOT clock was marked as critical, which automatically
made the AHB clock to stay always on. Since the TMU\_ROOT clock is not
marked as critical anymore, following commit:
"clk: imx8mq: Remove CLK\_IS\_CRITICAL flag for IMX8MQ\_CLK\_TMU\_ROOT"
all the clocks that derive from ipg\_root clock (and implicitly ahb clock)
would also have to enable, along with their own gate, the AHB clock.
But considering that AHB is actually a bus that has to be always on, we mark
it as critical in the clock provider driver and then all the clocks that
derive from it can be controlled through the dedicated per IP gate which
follows after the ipg\_root clock.

drm/tinydrm/Kconfig: drivers: Select BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE
[ Upstream commit 3389669ac5ea598562673c04971d7bb0fab0e9f1 ]
The mipi\_dbi helper is missing a dependency on DRM\_KMS\_HELPER and putting
that in revealed this problem:
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:12:error: recursive dependency detected!
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:12: symbol FB is selected by DRM\_KMS\_FB\_HELPER
drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig:75: symbol DRM\_KMS\_FB\_HELPER depends on DRM\_KMS\_HELPER
drivers/gpu/drm/Kconfig:69: symbol DRM\_KMS\_HELPER is selected by TINYDRM\_MIPI\_DBI
drivers/gpu/drm/tinydrm/Kconfig:11: symbol TINYDRM\_MIPI\_DBI is selected by TINYDRM\_HX8357D
drivers/gpu/drm/tinydrm/Kconfig:15: symbol TINYDRM\_HX8357D depends on BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE
drivers/video/backlight/Kconfig:144: symbol BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE is selected by FB\_BACKLIGHT
drivers/video/fbdev/Kconfig:187: symbol FB\_BACKLIGHT depends on FB
A symbol that selects DRM\_KMS\_HELPER can not depend on
BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE. The reason for this is that DRM\_KMS\_FB\_HELPER
selects FB instead of depending on it.
The tinydrm drivers have somehow gotten away with depending on
BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE because DRM\_TINYDRM selects DRM\_KMS\_HELPER and the
drivers depend on that symbol.
An audit shows that all DRM drivers that select DRM\_KMS\_HELPER and use
BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE, selects it:
DRM\_TILCDC, DRM\_GMA500, DRM\_SHMOBILE, DRM\_NOUVEAU, DRM\_FSL\_DCU,
DRM\_I915, DRM\_RADEON, DRM\_AMDGPU, DRM\_PARADE\_PS8622
Documentation/kbuild/kconfig-language.txt has a note regarding select:
1. 'select should be used with care since it doesn't visit dependencies.'
This is not a problem since BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE doesn't have any
dependencies.
2. 'In general use select only for non-visible symbols'
BACKLIGHT\_CLASS\_DEVICE is user visible.
The real solution to this would be to have DRM\_KMS\_FB\_HELPER depend on the
user visible symbol FB. That is a can of worms I'm not willing to tackle.
I fear that such a change will result in me handling difficult fallouts
for the next weeks. So I'm following DRM suite here.

drm/amd/display: Copy GSL groups when committing a new context
[ Upstream commit 21ffcc94d5b3dc024fedac700f1e7f9dacf4ab4f ]
[Why]
DC configures the GSL group for the pipe when pipe\_split is enabled
and we're switching flip types (buffered <-> immediate flip) on DCN2.
In order to record what GSL group the pipe is using DC stores it in
the pipe's stream\_res. DM is not aware of this internal grouping, nor
is DC resource.
So when DM creates a dc\_state context and passes it to DC the current
GSL group is lost - DM never knew about it in the first place.
After 3 immediate flips we run out of GSL groups and we're no longer
able to correctly perform \*any\* flip for multi-pipe scenarios.
[How]
The gsl\_group needs to be copied to the new context.
DM has no insight into GSL grouping and could even potentially create
a brand new context without referencing current hardware state. So this
makes the most sense to have happen in DC.
There are two places where DC can apply a new context:
- dc\_commit\_state
- dc\_commit\_updates\_for\_stream
But what's shared between both of these is apply\_ctx\_for\_surface.
This logic only matters for DCN2, so it can be placed in
dcn20\_apply\_ctx\_for\_surface. Before doing any locking (where the GSL
group is setup) we can copy over the GSL groups before committing the
new context.

drm/panel: simple: fix AUO g185han01 horizontal blanking
[ Upstream commit f8c6bfc612b56f02e1b8fae699dff12738aaf889 ]
The horizontal blanking periods are too short, as the values are
specified for a single LVDS channel. Since this panel is dual LVDS
they need to be doubled. With this change the panel reaches its
nominal vrefresh rate of 60Fps, instead of the 64Fps with the
current wrong blanking.
Philipp Zabel added:
The datasheet specifies 960 active clocks + 40/128/160 clocks blanking
on each of the two LVDS channels (min/typical/max), so doubled this is
now correct.

drm/vkms: Avoid assigning 0 for possible\_crtc
[ Upstream commit e9d85f731de06a35d2ae6cdcf7d0e037c98ef41a ]
When vkms invoke drm\_universal\_plane\_init(), it sets 0 for
possible\_crtcs parameter which means that planes can't be attached to
any CRTC. It currently works due to some safeguard in the drm\_crtc file;
however, it is possible to identify the problem by trying to append a
second connector. This patch fixes this issue by modifying
vkms\_plane\_init() to accept an index parameter which makes the code a
little bit more flexible and avoid set zero to possible\_crtcs.

According to the datasheet tc358767 can transfer up to 16 bytes via
its AUX channel, so the artificial limit of 8 appears to be too
low. However only up to 15-bytes seem to be actually supported and
trying to use 16-byte transfers results in transfers failing
sporadically (with bogus status in case of I2C transfers), so limit it
to 15.

drm/vkms: Fix crc worker races
[ Upstream commit 18d0952a838ba559655b0cd9cf85097ad63d9bca ]
The issue we have is that the crc worker might fall behind. We've
tried to handle this by tracking both the earliest frame for which it
still needs to compute a crc, and the last one. Plus when the
crtc\_state changes, we have a new work item, which are all run in
order due to the ordered workqueue we allocate for each vkms crtc.
Trouble is there's been a few small issues in the current code:
- we need to capture frame\_end in the vblank hrtimer, not in the
worker. The worker might run much later, and then we generate a lot
of crc for which there's already a different worker queued up.
- frame number might be 0, so create a new crc\_pending boolean to
track this without confusion.
- we need to atomically grab frame\_start/end and clear it, so do that
all in one go. This is not going to create a new race, because if we
race with the hrtimer then our work will be re-run.
- only race that can happen is the following:
1. worker starts
2. hrtimer runs and updates frame\_end
3. worker grabs frame\_start/end, already reading the new frame\_end,
and clears crc\_pending
4. hrtimer calls queue\_work()
5. worker completes
6. worker gets re-run, crc\_pending is false
Explain this case a bit better by rewording the comment.
v2: Demote warning level output to debug when we fail to requeue, this
is expected under high load when the crc worker can't quite keep up.
