## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18809](/security/CVE-2019-18809))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-19965](/security/CVE-2019-19965))

It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in

certain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-20096](/security/CVE-2019-20096))

Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel

when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations

before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-5108](/security/CVE-2019-5108))

It was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while

destroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-7053](/security/CVE-2020-7053))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4254-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

btrfs: merge btrfs\_find\_device and find\_device

```
Both btrfs_find_device() and find_device() does the same thing except
that the latter does not take the seed device onto account in the device
scanning context. We can merge them.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-5.0](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-5.0) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-gke-5.0](/security/cves?package=linux-gke-5.0) - Linux kernel for Google Container Engine (GKE) systems

## Details

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19050](/security/CVE-2019-19050), [CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19077](/security/CVE-2019-19077))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router TUN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19079](/security/CVE-2019-19079))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or have other unspecified impacts. ([CVE-2019-19252](/security/CVE-2019-19252))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 958300 960493 962254 963493 964153 964480 965365

Linux 4.19 has been packaged for Debian 9 as linux-4.19.  This
provides a supported upgrade path for systems that currently use
kernel packages from the "stretch-backports" suite.

There is no need to upgrade systems using Linux 4.9, as that kernel
version will also continue to be supported in the LTS period.

This backport does not include the following binary packages:

    hyperv-daemons libbpf-dev libbpf4.19 libcpupower-dev libcpupower1
    liblockdep-dev liblockdep4.19 linux-compiler-gcc-6-arm
    linux-compiler-gcc-6-x86 linux-cpupower linux-libc-dev lockdep
    usbip

Older versions of most of those are built from the linux source
package in Debian 9.

The kernel images and modules will not be signed for use on systems
with Secure Boot enabled, as there is no support for this in Debian 9.

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or information leak.

CVE-2019-18814

    Navid Emamdoost reported a potential use-after-free in the
    AppArmor security module, in the case that audit rule
    initialisation fails.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-18885

    The 'bobfuzzer' team discovered that crafted Btrfs volumes could
    trigger a crash (oops).  An attacker able to mount such a volume
    could use this to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2019-20810

    A potential memory leak was discovered in the go7007 media driver.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-10766

    Anthony Steinhauser reported a flaw in the mitigation for
    Speculative Store Bypass (CVE-2018-3639) on x86 CPUs.  A local
    user could use this to temporarily disable SSB mitigation in other
    users' tasks.  If those other tasks run sandboxed code, this would
    allow that code to read sensitive information in the same process
    but outside the sandbox.

CVE-2020-10767

    Anthony Steinhauser reported a flaw in the mitigation for Spectre
    variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715) on x86 CPUs.  Depending on which other
    mitigations the CPU supports, the kernel might not use IBPB to
    mitigate Spectre variant 2 in user-space.  A local user could use
    this to read sensitive information from other users' processes.

CVE-2020-10768

    Anthony Steinhauser reported a flaw in the mitigation for Spectre
    variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715) on x86 CPUs.  After a task force-
    disabled indirect branch speculation through prctl(), it could
    still re-enable it later, so it was not possible to override a
    program that explicitly enabled it.

CVE-2020-12655

    Zheng Bin reported that crafted XFS volumes could trigger a system
    hang.  An attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to
    cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-12771

    Zhiqiang Liu reported a bug in the bcache block driver that could
    lead to a system hang.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2020-13974

    Kyungtae Kim reported a potential integer overflow in the vt
    (virtual terminal) driver.  The security impact of this is
    unclear.

CVE-2020-15393

    Kyungtae Kim reported a memory leak in the usbtest driver.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

## Infomations

null dereference in btrfs\_verify\_dev\_extents(loop list entry)

### Overview

on mounting crafted btrfs image, got Null-Ptr-Deref.

### Target

Tested on Linux Kernel 5.0.21 BTRFS filesystem(source [here](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/linux-5.0.21.tar.gz))

(It can be need `CONFIG_BTRFS_FS=m` option.)

### Reproduce

attached crafted image on [here](/bobfuzzer/CVE-2019-18885/blob/master/poc_2019_18885.zip)

```
mkdir ./mnt
mount -t btrfs ./poc_2019_18885.img ./mnt
```

### Bug Causes

fs/btrfs/volumes.c:430

```
static struct btrfs_device *find_device(struct btrfs_fs_devices *fs_devices,
		u64 devid, const u8 *uuid)
{
	struct btrfs_device *dev;

[1]	list_for_each_entry(dev, &fs_devices->devices, dev_list) {
		if (dev->devid == devid &&
		    (!uuid || !memcmp(dev->uuid, uuid, BTRFS_UUID_SIZE))) {
			return dev;
		}
	}
	return NULL;
}
```

in `list_for_each_entry` loop(`[1]`), `&fs_devices->devices` list entry can be NULL

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Fuzzing File Systems via
Two-Dimensional Input Space Exploration

Wen Xu Hyungon Moon† Sanidhya Kashyap Po-Ning Tseng Taesoo Kim

Georgia Institute of Technology
†Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology

Abstract—File systems, a basic building block of an OS, are
too big and too complex to be bug free. Nevertheless, file systems
rely on regular stress-testing tools and formal checkers to find
bugs, which are limited due to the ever-increasing complexity
of both file systems and OSes. Thus, fuzzing, proven to be an
effective and a practical approach, becomes a preferable choice,
as it does not need much knowledge about a target. However,
three main challenges exist in fuzzing file systems: mutating a
large image blob that degrades overall performance, generating
image-dependent file operations, and reproducing found bugs,
which is difficult for existing OS fuzzers.

Hence, we present JANUS, the first feedback-driven fuzzer
that explores the two-dimensional input space of a file system,
i.e., mutating metadata on a large image, while emitting image-
directed file operations. In addition, JANUS relies on a library
OS rather than on traditional VMs for fuzzing, which enables
JANUS to load a fresh copy of the OS, thereby leading to better
reproducibility of bugs. We evaluate JANUS on eight file systems
and found 90 bugs in the upstream Linux kernel, 62 of which have
been acknowledged. Forty-three bugs have been fixed with 32
CVEs assigned. In addition, JANUS achieves higher code coverage
on all the file systems after fuzzing 12 hours, when compared
with the state-of-the-art fuzzer Syzkaller for fuzzing file systems.
JANUS visits 4.19× and 2.01× more code paths in Btrfs and ext4,
respectively. Moreover, JANUS is able to reproduce 88–100% of
the crashes, while Syzkaller fails on all of them.

I. INTRODUCTION

File systems are one of the most basic system services of an
operating system that play an important role in managing the
files of users and tolerating system crashes without losing data
consistency. Currently, most of the conventional file systems,
such as ext4 [8], XFS [64], Btrfs [59], and F2FS [30], run in
the OS kernel. Hence, bugs in file systems cause devastating
errors, such as system reboots, OS deadlock, and unrecoverable
errors of the whole file system image. In addition, they also
pose severe security threats. For instance, attackers exploit
various file system issues by mounting a crafted disk image [28]
or invoking vulnerable file system-specific operations [37]
to achieve code execution or privilege escalation on victim
machines. However, manually eliminating every bug in a file
system that has sheer complexity is a challenge, even for
an expert. For example, the latest implementation of ext4 in
Linux v4.18 comprises 50K lines of code, while that of Btrfs
is nearly 130K LoC. At the same time, many widely used
file systems are still under active development. File system
developers consistently optimize performance [72] and add new
features [11, 29], meanwhile introducing new bugs [26, 27, 40].

To automatically discover these potential bugs, most file
systems in development rely on the known stress-testing frame-
works (xfstests [63], fsck [56, 69], Linux Test Project [62], etc.)
that mostly focus on the regression of file systems with minimal
integrity checks. For example, one of the bugs we found in
ext4 (i.e., CVE-2018-10880) crashes the kernel by moving a
critical extended attribute out of the inode structure. We trigger
this bug by mounting a normal ext4 image formatted with
inline_data, which bypasses integrity checks in both xfstests
and fsck. In addition, some prior works have applied model
checking [73, 74] to find file system bugs, which requires a
deep understanding of both the file system and OS states. This
is now impractical due to the increasing complexity of modern
OSes [2, 35, 68]. On the other hand, most of the verified file
systems [6, 9] are too immature to adopt in practice.

Another approach—fuzzing—is gaining traction. Fuzzing
not only requires minimal knowledge about the target software,
but also is an effective and a practical approach that has found
thousands of vulnerabilities [15, 18, 34, 76]. Hence, fuzzing is a
viable approach to automatically discover bugs in a wide range
of file systems (e.g., 54 in the Linux kernel). However, unlike
other ordinary targets, fuzzing file systems is dependent on two
inputs: a mounted disk image and a sequence of file operations
(i.e., system calls) that are executed on the mounted image.
Existing fuzzers either focus on mutating images as ordinary
binary inputs [21, 48, 57, 61] or generating random sets of
file operation-specific system calls [20, 25, 46]. Unfortunately,
they all fail to efficiently and comprehensively test file systems
because of the following three challenges.

First, a disk image is a large binary blob that is structured
but complicated, and the minimum size can be almost 100×
larger than the maximum preferred size of general fuzzers [76],
which dramatically degrades the fuzzing throughput [21, 57, 61]
due to the heavy I/O involved in mutating images. Another
issue related to blob mutation is that existing fuzzers [20, 48]
mutate only non-zero chunks in an image. This approach is
unsound because these fuzzers do not exploit the properties
of structured data, i.e., file system layout, in which mutating
metadata blocks is more effective than mutating data blocks. In
addition, without any knowledge about the file system layout,
existing fuzzers also fail to fix any metadata checksum after
corrupting metadata blocks. The second challenge is that file
operations are context-aware workloads, i.e., a dependence
exists between an image and the file operations executed on

it. In particular, the real-time status of a mounted file system
determines which file objects a set of system calls can operate
on, and the invocation of a particular system call brings changes
to the object being operated on. Unfortunately, existing system
call fuzzers [20, 25, 46], which independently generate random
system calls with hard-coded file paths, fail to emit meaningful
sequences of file operations, and cover deep code paths of a
file system. The third issue with existing fuzzers is the aspect
of reproducing found bugs. Most of the existing fuzzers that
target OSes [20, 25, 46] or file systems [48] test generated
inputs without reloading a fresh copy of the OS instance or
file system image, i.e., they do not use a non-aging OS and
file system. The reason they do not re-initialize the OS or file
systems is that they rely on VM, QEMU, or user-mode Linux
(UML) [13] instances that take seconds to reload a fresh copy.
To overcome this issue, they reuse these instances, thereby
leading to dirty OS states, which eventually results in unstable
executions and irreproducible bugs.

We address the aforementioned challenges with JANUS, an
evolutionary feedback-driven fuzzer, that effectively explores
the two-dimensional input space of a disk file system. JANUS
addresses the first problem by exploiting the structured data
property in the form of metadata, i.e., it mutates only metadata
thereby drastically pruning the
blocks of a seed image,
searching space of the input. Second, we propose the image-
directed syscall fuzzing technique to fuzz file operations, i.e.,
JANUS not only stores generated system calls but also deduces
the runtime status of every file object on the image after these
system calls complete. JANUS then uses the speculated status as
feedback to generate a new set of system calls, thereby emitting
context-aware workloads. During each fuzzing iteration, JANUS
performs image fuzzing with higher priority and then invokes
image-directed syscall fuzzing to fully explore a target file
system. Finally, JANUS solves the reproducibility problem,
which is tightly coupled with the scalability of OS fuzzing as
well as OS aging, by always loading a fresh copy of the OS
to test the file system-related OS functionalities with the help
of a library OS (i.e., Linux Kernel Library [54]), running in
user space.

With JANUS, we fuzzed eight popular file systems in the
upstream Linux kernel (v4.16–v4.18) for four months. Our
evaluation shows that JANUS achieves at most 4.19× more
code coverage than the state-of-the-art OS fuzzer Syzkaller.
Moreover, our choice of using a library OS enables us
to reproduce 88-100% of crashes, while Syzkaller fails to
reproduce any. Until now, we have successfully found 90 bugs,
and developers have already acknowledged 62 of them, 43 of
which have been fixed with 32 CVEs assigned.
This paper makes the following contributions:

• Issues. We identify three prominent issues of existing
file systems fuzzers: (1) fuzzing a large blob image is
inefficient; (2) fuzzers do not exploit the dependence
between a file system image and file operations; (3)
fuzzers use aging OSes and file systems, which results in
irreproducible bugs.

• Approach. We design and implement an evolutionary
file system fuzzer, called JANUS, that efficiently mutates
metadata blocks in a large seed image while generating
image-directed workloads to extensively explore a target
file system. JANUS further leverages a library OS (i.e.,
LKL) other than a VM to test OS functionalities, so as to
provide a clean-slate OS image in a matter of milliseconds.
• Impact. We evaluate JANUS on eight file systems and find
90 bugs in the upstream kernel, 62 and 43 of which have
been acknowledged and patched with 32 CVEs assigned.
Moreover, JANUS outperforms Syzkaller regarding code
coverage on all selected file systems. In particular, JANUS
eventually visits 4.19× and 2.01× more code paths than
Syzkaller when fuzzing Btrfs and ext4, respectively, for
12 hours. Meanwhile, JANUS can reproduce 88-100% of
the found crashes, while Syzkaller fails to reproduce any.

Threat Model.
In this work, we assume that an attacker is
privileged to mount a fully crafted disk image on a target
machine and operate files stored on the image to exploit
security bugs in an in-kernel file system. Practical ways exist
for an attacker to achieve this without root privilege, including:
(1) Auto-mounting. Modern OSes automatically mount an
untrusted plugged-in drive if it supports the corresponding file
system, which is exploited by several infamous attacks such
as Stuxnet [28], "evil maid attack" [60], etc.; (2) Unprivileged
mounts. macOS allows a non-root user to mount an Apple disk
image applying various file systems such as HFS, HFS+, APFS,
etc., and a number of bugs are found in these file systems that
lead to memory read restriction bypass and code execution
in the kernel [38, 39, 77]. Linux also allows unprivileged
users to mount any file system with FS_USERNS_MOUNT in a user
namespace [12].

II. BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION

Commodity OSes usually implement a disk file system as a
kernel module. Users are tasked with mounting the large-size
and formatted image and manage data via file operations. In this
section, we first describe general fuzzing approaches (§II-A)
and existing file system fuzzers (§II-B). Later, we explain why
they all fail to efficiently test file systems. We then summarize
the challenges and potential opportunities in file system fuzzing
(§II-C).

A. A Primer on Fuzzing

Fuzzing is a popular software-testing method that repeatedly
generates new inputs and injects them into a target program to
trigger bugs. It is one of the most effective approaches in prac-
tice to find security bugs in modern software. For example, the
state-of-the-art fuzzer AFL [76] and its variants [4, 5, 15, 51],
have discovered numerous bugs in open-source software. To
effectively explore a target program, recent fuzzers leverage
the past code coverage to later direct the input generation.
Moreover, software such as an OS is the most critical program,
as discovered bugs allow privilege escalation on a target
machine. To fuzz OSes, several frameworks [20, 46, 61] extend

of them, including extent tree nodes, directory entries, and journal

group descriptors, etc.) are in the beginning.

feedback-driven fuzzing approaches to trigger kernel bugs by
invoking randomly generated system calls.

B. File System Fuzzing

A disk file system has two-dimensional input space: (1) the
structured file system image format; and (2) file operations that
users invoke to access files stored on a mounted image. Several
file system fuzzing tools use a generic fuzzing infrastructure
to target either images or file operations.

1) Disk Image Fuzzer: A disk image is a large structured
binary blob. The blob has (1) user data and (2) several
management structures, called metadata, that a file system
needs to access, load, recover, and search data or to fulfill
other specific requirements of a file system. Figure 1 presents
the on-disk layout of a typical ext4 image.1 However, the size
of metadata constitutes merely 1% of the image size [1]. On
the other hand, the minimal size of a valid image can be 100
MBs (see Table I), which further increases on enabling certain
features. Three issues occur with an image as a fuzzing input:
(1) Large input size leads to an exponential increase in the
input space exploration. Meanwhile, important metadata are
mutated infrequently. (2) A fuzzer performs frequent read and
write operations on input files. When fuzzing a disk image, it
repeatedly reads during mutation, writes after mutation, and
saves the image if necessary. As a result, the large size of a
disk image slows down essential file operations, leading to
huge performance overhead. (3) Finally, to detect metadata
corruption, several file systems (e.g., XFS v5, GFS2, F2FS, etc.)
introduce checksums to protect on-disk metadata. Hence, the
kernel rejects a corrupt image, with mutated metadata blocks
without correct checksums, during initialization.

Disk image fuzzers [21, 48, 57, 61, 69] enforce a file system
to mount and execute a sequence of file operations on the
mutated disk images to trigger file system-specific bugs. Early
fuzzers [21, 57] ineffectively mutate bytes at random offsets in a
valid image to generate new images or mutate bytes in metadata
blocks only. These approaches incur heavy disk I/O from
loading and saving entire images. Moreover, these blind fuzzing
techniques generate poor-quality images without utilizing past
coverage. To overcome this, most recent fuzzers [20, 48] are

1We have listed its file hierarchy in Figure 9 including files and directories.

driven by code coverage. Moreover, they extract all the non-zero
chunks in a seed image for mutation. This approach touches
most of the metadata blocks and improves fuzzing performance
by decreasing input size. Nevertheless, these non-zero chunks
not only contain non-zero data blocks but also discard the
zero initialized metadata blocks, which results in sub-optimal
file system fuzzing. In addition, as metadata blocks are not
precisely located, this approach fails to fix their checksums.

2) File Operation Fuzzer: Since file systems are part of
the OS, a general approach to fuzz them is to invoke a set
of system calls [20, 25, 46]. Although porting these fuzzers
to target file system operations is straightforward, they fail
to efficiently fuzz file systems for two reasons: First, file
operations modify only file objects (e.g., directories, symbolic
links, etc.) that exist on the image, and a completed operation
affects particular objects. However, existing OS fuzzers do not
consider the dynamic dependence between an image and file
operations, as they blindly generate system calls, that explore
a file system superficially. For example, the state-of-the-art
OS fuzzer, Syzkaller, generates system calls based upon static
grammar rules describing the data types of every argument and
return value for every target system call. Therefore, Syzkaller
is able to generate a single semantically correct system call but
fails to explore the collective behavior of a set of system calls
and the modified file system image. For instance, Syzkaller may
emit multiples of open() calls on a file with its old path that
has been either renamed (rename()) or removed (unlink()).
Second, existing OS fuzzers [20, 61] mostly use virtualized
instances (e.g., KVM, QEMU, etc.) to run a target OS without
reloading a fresh copy of the OS or file system for every testing
input for the sake of performance. Unfortunately, fuzzing with
an aging OS or file systems has two issues: (1) The execution
of an aging OS becomes non-deterministic after processing
numerous system calls. For example, kmalloc() which depends
on prior allocations, behaves differently across runs. Sometimes
a kernel component (e.g., journaling system) quietly fails and
detaches from the OS without triggering any file system crash
during a long-run fuzzing. (2) A bug found by these fuzzers
accumulates the impact of thousands of invoked system calls,
which impedes the generation of a stable proof-of-concept for
developers to reproduce the bug and debug it [19].

3) File System Fuzzer: As mentioned before, most fuzzers
either fuzz a binary input [34, 76] or use a sequence of system
calls to fuzz the OS [20, 25]. However, to fuzz a file system,
we need to mutate two inputs: (1) the binary image (i.e., a file
system image) and (2) the corresponding workload (i.e., a set
of file system specific system calls). Unfortunately, combining
these two existing fuzzing techniques is not straightforward.
Recently, Syzkaller tried to achieve both by mutating non-zero
chunks in an image, while independently generating context-
unaware workloads to test the mutated image, which is still
unsound and ineffective.

C. Challenges of Fuzzing a File System

We summarize a set of challenges of fuzzing file systems
in the Linux kernel, and present our insights in designing

are applicable to other OSes as well.
Handling large disk images as input. An image fuzzer
should effectively fuzz a complicated, large disk image by (1)
mutating scattered metadata in the image with checksum, and
(2) mitigating frequent disk I/O due to input manipulation.
Unfortunately, current fuzzers fail to address these issues
simultaneously (see §II-B1). An ideal image fuzzer should
target only the metadata, rather than the entire disk image, and
must fix the checksum for any mutated metadata structure.
Missing context-aware workloads. File system-aware work-
loads directly affect the image. In particular, valid file opera-
tions modify file objects on an image (e.g., open() creates a
new file and unlink() removes one link of an existing file) at
runtime. However, existing fuzzers rely on the predefined image
information (i.e., valid file and directory paths on a seed image)
to generate system calls, and thereby fail to comprehensively
test all the accessible file objects in a target file system at
runtime (§II-B2). Therefore, a better approach is to maintain the
runtime status of every file object on an image after performing
past file operations for generating new ones.
Exploring input space in two dimensions. A file system
processes two types of inputs, including disk images and
file operations which are organized in completely different
formats (i.e., binary blob versus sequential operations), but
have an implicit connection between them. To fully explore
a file system, a fuzzer should mutate both of them, which is
not supported by existing fuzzers. Thus, we aim to propose
a hybrid approach that explores both dimensions by fuzzing
image bytes and file operations simultaneously.
Reproducing found crashes. Traditional OS fuzzers use
virtualized instances to test OS functionalities. However, to
avoid the expensive cost of rebooting a VM or reverting a
snapshot, they re-uses an OS or file system instance across
multiple runs, which leads to unstable kernel executions and
irreproducible bugs (see §II-B2). This issue can be overcome
by leveraging a library OS [53, 54] that provides the exact OS
behavior and re-initializes the OS states within milliseconds.

A. Overview

III. DESIGN

JANUS is a feedback-driven fuzzer that mutates the metadata
of a seed image, while generating context-aware file operations
(i.e., system calls) to comprehensively explore a file system. In
general, JANUS adopts the following design choices to resolve
the aforementioned challenges regarding file system fuzzing
(see §II-C). First, JANUS merely stores the metadata extracted
from the seed image as its mutation target, which is critical
for a file system to manage user data. In addition, JANUS
re-calculates every metadata checksum value after mutation.
Since the metadata occupy a small space (1%), the size of
an input test case is much smaller than that of an entire disk
image, which enables high fuzzing throughput. Second, JANUS
does not rely on manually specified information about the
files stored on a seed image, as it becomes stale over time

4

Fig. 2: An overview of JANUS. In each fuzzing iteration, JANUS
loads a test case from its working corpus, which consists of three
parts: the metadata of a seed image, a program containing a list of file
operations, and the speculated image status at runtime after executing
the program ( 1 ). Then the fuzzing engine of JANUS mutates the test
case in two directions: (1) The image mutator randomly mutates the
metadata, and the fuzzing engine outputs the mutated metadata along
with the intact program for testing ( 2 ), or (2) The syscall fuzzer
mutates existing system calls in the program or appends new ones, and
updates the image status correspondingly as the workload changes
( 2 ). In this case, the fuzzing engine outputs the intact metadata
and the newly generated program. Next, JANUS releases the output
metadata into a full-size image ( 3 ) and delivers the image with the
output program ( 3 ) to a library OS based executor. The executor
mounts the image and executes the program, whose execution trace is
profiled into a bitmap shared with the fuzzing engine of JANUS ( 4 ).
If new code paths are discovered, the output metadata and program,
and the updated image status are packed as a new test case and saved
into the corpus for future mutation ( 5 ).

and results in ineffective test case generation. Instead, JANUS
generates new file operations based upon the deduced status
of an image after completing old ones in a workload. Third,
JANUS manages to explore the two-dimensional input space
of a file system by wisely scheduling image fuzzing and file
operation fuzzing. Considering the fact that the original image
determines the initial state of a file system and affects the
executions of the foremost file operations, JANUS makes the
first effort to mutate image bytes. Lastly, JANUS relies on a
library OS to test kernel functions in user space. A library OS
instance runs as a user application, which can be re-launched
with negligible overhead, and thereby helps to increase the
chance of reproducing a found bug.

Figure 2 presents the detailed design of JANUS. A binary
input for JANUS consists of three parts: (1) a binary blob
comprising the metadata blocks of a seed image, (2) a serialized
program (i.e., file system workload) that describes a sequence
of system calls, and (3) the speculated image status after the
program operates the image. In the beginning, JANUS relies
on a file system-specific parser to extract metadata from a
seed image. JANUS also inspects the seed image to retrieve
initial image status and generate starting programs. The original
metadata, along with the image status and the program, are
packed as a test case and are saved into JANUS’S working
corpus. JANUS initiates fuzzing with both the image mutator
and the system call fuzzer by selecting a test case from the
corpus ( 1 ) for exploring the two-dimensional input space in
an infinite loop. First, the fuzzing engine invokes the image
mutator to flip the bytes of the metadata blob in several ways

and outputs mutated blobs ( 2 ). At the same time, the program
in the test case remains unchanged. Later on, the system call
fuzzer enables JANUS to either mutate the argument values of
existing system calls in the program or append new ones to the
program. The system call fuzzer also produces new image status
according to the newly generated program ( 2 ). Meanwhile, the
metadata part remains intact. The output metadata is combined
with other unchanged parts (i.e., user data) to produce a full-size
image with all the checksum values re-calculated by JANUS
( 3 ). And the output program is also serialized and saved onto
the disk ( 3 ). A user-space system call executor, which relies
on a library OS, launches a new instance to mount the full-size
image and perform the file operations involved in the program
loaded from the disk ( 4 ). The runtime path coverage of the
executor is profiled into a bitmap shared with JANUS’s fuzzing
engine. The fuzzing engine inspects the bitmap; on discovering
a new path, JANUS saves the shrunken image, the serialized
program, and the speculated image status into one binary input
for further mutation in successive runs ( 5 ). Note that for
each test case, JANUS always launches the image mutator first
for certain rounds and invokes the system call fuzzer if no
interesting test case is discovered.

We first describe how JANUS generates the starting test cases
by parsing a seed image in §III-B. We then present how it
fuzzes image bytes and generates file operations in §III-C and
§III-D, respectively. More important, we describe how JANUS
integrates two core fuzzers in §III-E. Finally, we present our
new library OS-based environment for file system fuzzing in
§III-F.

B. Building Corpus

JANUS relies on its image parser and system call fuzzer
to build its initial corpus upon a seed image (see Figure 3).
The first part of the test cases in the corpus is the essential
metadata blocks of the seed image, which constitutes around
1% of the total size, thereby overcoming the challenges of
fuzzing a disk image, as described in §II-C. Specifically, JANUS

first maps the entire image into a memory buffer. Then a file
system-specific image parser scans the image and locates all
the on-disk metadata according to the specification of the
applied file system. JANUS re-assembles these metadata into a
shrunken blob for mutation afterward and records their sizes
and in-image offsets. For any metadata structure protected
by checksum, JANUS records the in-metadata offset of the
checksum field recognized by the image parser. Second, the
starting test cases also include the information of every file
and directory on the image that allows JANUS to use that
knowledge for generating context-aware workloads afterward.
In particular, the system call fuzzer probes the seed image and
retrieves the path, type (e.g., normal file, directory, symbolic
link, FIFO file, etc.), and extended attributes of every file object
on it, which are packed into every initial test case. Moreover,
every initial test case involves a starting program that has a
distinct system call generated by the system call fuzzer for
mutation. To enlarge the overall coverage of the corpus, each
randomly generated system call operates a unique file object
(see §III-D for the details of program format and system call
generation). The metadata and the file status of the seed image,
along with a starting program together form an input test case,
which is packed by JANUS and saved into the corpus on the
disk for future fuzzing.

C. Fuzzing Images

JANUS relies on the image mutator to fuzz images. In
particular, the image mutator loads the metadata blocks of
a test case, and applies several common fuzzing strategies [76]
(e.g., bit flipping, arithmetic operation on random bytes, etc.)
to randomly mutate the bytes of the metadata, as described in
Figure 4 ( 2 ). Similar to existing fuzzers [75], JANUS prefers a
group of specific integers (i.e., interesting values in Figure 4),
such as -1, 0, INT_MAX, etc., instead of purely random values
to mutate the metadata. In our evaluation, these special values
enable the image mutator to produce more corner cases, which
are not correctly handled by the file system (e.g., bug #1, #6,
#14, #28, #33, etc. in Table VI found by JANUS) and also
more extreme cases that increase the probability of crashing

the kernel by triggering a specific bug at runtime (e.g., most
of the out-of-bound access bugs discovered by JANUS).

After mutating the entire metadata blob, JANUS copies each
metadata block in the blob back to its corresponding position
inside the memory buffer, which stores the original full-size
image ( 3 ). To maintain the sanctity of the image, the image
parser recalculates the checksum value of every metadata block
by following the specific algorithm adopted by the target file
system, and fills the value at the recorded offset of the checksum
field.

D. Fuzzing File Operations

The system call fuzzer enables JANUS to generate image-
directed workloads to effectively explore how a file system
handles various file operations requested by users. First, we
present the structure of a program manipulated by the system
call fuzzer. A program includes a list of ordered system calls
that modifies the mutated image and maintains a variable bank
that stores the variables used by system calls. JANUS describes
each system call as a tuple of the syscall number, argument
values, and a return value. If any argument value or return
value is not a simple constant but a variable, JANUS presents
it as an index pointing to the variable stored in the variable
bank. In addition, the program also includes a list of active
file descriptors that are opened and have not been closed by
the program.

6

Similar to existing fuzzers (e.g., Syzkaller), the system call
fuzzer generates new programs from an input program in two
ways: (1) Syscall mutation. The system call fuzzer randomly
selects one system call in the program, and generates a list
of new values to replace the old value of a randomly selected
argument; (2) Syscall generation. The system call fuzzer
appends a new system call to the program, whose arguments
have randomly generated values. In particular, JANUS adopts
the same strategies that Syzkaller uses to generate values for the
trivial arguments of a system call. The candidate values of these
arguments are independent of our speculated runtime status.
For any argument that has a clearly defined set of its available
values, JANUS randomly selects values from the set for it.
(e.g., int whence for lseek()). Moreover, JANUS generates
random numbers in a certain range for the arguments of an
integer type (e.g., size_t count for write()). Furthermore, a
number of file operations requires an argument of a pointer
type. Such a pointer normally points to a buffer that is used to
store either user data (e.g., void *buf for write()) or kernel
output (e.g., void *buf for read()). For the former case, the
system call fuzzer declares an array filled with random values
for the argument. A fixed array is always used in the latter
case, since JANUS is not driven by what the kernel outputs at
runtime except for its code coverage.

Nevertheless, for those non-trivial arguments whose proper
values depend on the running context of a file system, JANUS
generates their values based not only on their expected types,
but more important, on our maintained status by following
mainly three rules: (1) If a file descriptor is required, the system
call fuzzer randomly picks an opened file descriptor of proper
type. For instance, write() requires a normal file descriptor,
while getdents() asks for the file descriptor of a directory; (2)
If a path is required, the system call fuzzer randomly selects the
path of an existing file or directory, or a stale file or directory
that is removed by recent operations. For instance, JANUS
provides the path of a normal file or a directory to rename(),
but delivers only that of a valid directory required by rmdir().
If the path is used to create a new file or directory, JANUS may
also randomly generate a brand new path that is located under
an existing directory; (3) If a system call operates the existing
extended attribute of a particular file (e.g., getxattr() and
setxattr()), the system call fuzzer randomly picks a recorded
extended attribute name of the file. The generation strategies
enable JANUS to emit context-aware workloads on fresh file
objects that are free of runtime errors and achieve high code
coverage.

For a newly generated system call, JANUS appends it to
the program and, more important, summarizes the potential
changes to the file system caused by the system call and
updates the speculated status of the image correspondingly.
For instance, open(), mkdir(), link(), or symlink() may
create a new file or directory, while open() also introduces
an active file descriptor; rmdir() or unlink() removes a file
or a directory from the image; rename() updates the path of
a file and setxattr() or removexattr() updates a particular
extended attribute.

TABLE II: Implementation complexity of JANUS, including the
changes to AFL and LKL for file system fuzzing. Since we directly
reuse the existing binary mutation algorithms in AFL for the image
mutator, we omit its code size.

Fig. 7: Pseudo-code of one fuzzing iteration in JANUS.

F. Library OS based Kernel Execution Environment

Note that in the current design, JANUS maintains only the
speculated image status after completing the execution of
a program. Therefore, JANUS avoids any mutation on the
existing arguments that result in potential changes to the image
status. For instance, JANUS may mutate fd of a write() in the
program while never touching path of unlink(), since such
a mutation may invalidate the system calls after the mutated
ones (e.g., changing unlink("A") to unlink("B") affect all the
existing file operations afterward on file B in a test case).

E. Exploring Two-Dimensional Input Space

To fuzz both metadata and system calls together, JANUS
schedules its two core fuzzers in order. Figure 7 describes
one fuzzing iteration of JANUS. Specifically, for an input test
case, which contains a shrunken image and a program, JANUS
first launches the image mutator to mutate random bytes on
the shrunken image. If no new code path is discovered with
the unchanged program, JANUS invokes the system call fuzzer
to mutate the argument values of an existing system call in
the program for certain rounds. If still no new code path is
explored, JANUS eventually tries to append new system calls
to the program. Note that rounds in every fuzzing stage are
user defined.

Scheduling image fuzzing and file operation fuzzing in such
an order is effective as follows: (1) The extracted metadata
indicate the initial state of an image, whose impacts on the
executions of file operations gradually decreases when the
image has been operated by several system calls. Hence, JANUS
always tries to mutate metadata first. (2) Introducing new file
operations exponentially increases the mutation space of a
program and may also erase the changes from past operations of
the image. Therefore, JANUS prefers mutating existing system
calls rather than generating new ones.

To avoid using an aging OS or file system that results
in unstable executions and irreproducible bugs (see §II-C),
JANUS relies on a library OS based application (i.e., executor)
to fuzz OS functionalities. Specifically, JANUS forks a new
instance of the executor to test every newly generated image and
workload from the fuzzing engine ( 4 ). Note that forking a user
application incurs negligible time compared with resetting a
VM instance. Hence, JANUS guarantees a clean-slate kernel for
every test case with low overhead. Moreover, as both fuzzing
engine and executor run in user space on one machine, sharing
input files and coverage bitmap between them is straightforward,
which is challenging for VM-based fuzzers that run the fuzzing
engine outside VM instances. In addition, a library OS instance
requires far less computing resources compared with any type
of VMs. Therefore, we can deploy JANUS instances on a large
scale without severe contention.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION

We implement JANUS as a variant of AFL (version 2.52b).
JANUS adopts the basic infrastructure of AFL, including the
forkserver, coverage bitmap, and test-case scheduling algorithm.
We extend AFL with the the image mutator and the system
call fuzzer. In addition, we implement an image inspector to
build the initial corpus from a seed image and a program
serializer for delivering generated programs between memory
and working corpus. Furthermore, we implement an executor
based on Linux Kernel Library (LKL) to test newly generated
images and workloads. Note that we also modify LKL to
support the kernel address sanitizer (KASAN) [17], which
is widely adopted by OS fuzzers to detect memory errors.
For ease of reproducing bugs in a real environment, we also
implement a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) generator that produces
a full-size image along with a compilable C program from a
serialized test case. Table II presents the lines of code (LoC)

7

of each components of JANUS. In this section, we describe the
implementation details of several main components.
Image parser and image mutator. We implement the image
parser as a dynamic library to locate metadata and identify
checksums on a seed image. Currently, the image parser
supports parsing the disk images of eight widely used file
systems on Linux, including ext4, XFS, Btrfs, F2FS, GFS2,
HFS+, ReiserFS, and VFAT. Our implementation of the image
parser refers to the user-space utilities (e.g., mkfs and fsck) of
those file systems. We also implement the image mutator, which
randomly mutates the bytes of a shrunken image through eight
strategies (see Figure 4). We directly port the implementation
of these mutation strategies from AFL in JANUS.
Image inspector. We implement an image inspector for
JANUS, which iterates files and directories on a seed image,
and records their in-image paths, types, and extended attributes
for building initial test cases (see §III-B).
Program serializer. We describe newly generated programs
and updated status in a serializable format (see Figure 12) and
implement a corresponding program serializer. The serializer
loads them from the disk into the memory for fuzzing and
testing, and saves them from memory onto the disk for
bookkeeping.
System call fuzzer. The system call fuzzer is implemented
as a new extension for AFL, which is invoked by JANUS
when image mutation fails to make progress. The system call
fuzzer receives a deserialized program and the corresponding
status, and outputs new programs and updated status through
system call mutation or system call generation (see §III-D).
Currently, JANUS supports generating and mutating 34 system
calls designed for fundamental file operations (see §F). A
number of system calls related to file operations to a certain
extent but mainly realized at the VFS (virtual file system) layer
(e.g., dup(), splice(), tee(), etc.) are not worth being tested
and are excluded by JANUS.

In our implementation, JANUS basically mutates metadata
in a test case for 256 rounds, which is the default setting for
the havoc stage (i.e., nondeterministic mutation) in AFL. If the
code coverage fails to increase, JANUS tries to mutate existing
system calls for 128 rounds and appends new ones for another
64 rounds. JANUS spends more effort on image mutation due
to its higher priority when exploring the two-dimensional input
space (see §III-E).
LKL-based executor. We build our executor for JANUS upon
Linux Kernel Library (LKL), which is a typical library OS that
exposes kernel interfaces to user-space programs. Figure 11
presents a code example of using LKL system calls to operate
an ext4 image. The official LKL currently works with Linux
kernel v4.16 and we port it to be compatible with recent
versions, including v4.17 and v4.18. To achieve AFL-style path
coverage at runtime, we implement a GCC wrapper to selectively
instrument the source files of a target file system when building
LKL. Furthermore, we implement a user application (i.e., the
executor) linked with LKL as the fuzzing target of JANUS. For
a generated test case, the executor forks a new instance through

the forkserver and invokes LKL system calls to mount an image
mutated by the image mutator and perform a sequence of file
operations generated by the system call fuzzer.

As flushing a full-size image onto the disk every time takes
much time, we introduce a persistent memory buffer shared
between JANUS’s fuzzing engine and the LKL-based executor
to store the image (i.e., ctx.image_buffer in Figure 3). The
LKL’s block device driver underlying a file system is then
modified to access the memory buffer instead of the image file
on the disk when acquiring any image data. Moreover, we apply
the Copy-on-Write (CoW) technique at runtime to guarantee
that besides the mutated blocks, other parts inside the image
buffer never change when the image buffer is operated by the
generated workload. Specifically, when the device driver tends
to flush any byte back to a block on the image at runtime,
the block is duplicated for modification and later accesses
from LKL. In addition, we port the kernel address sanitizer
(KASAN) to LKL, which can effectively detect memory errors
at runtime. KASAN allocates shadow memory at runtime to
record whether each byte of the original memory is safe to
access. Note that KASAN relies on MMU to translate an
address to its corresponding shadow address, which is not
supported by LKL. Hence, we reserve the shadow memory
space and build the mappings from the memory space of LKL
to the shadow memory at LKL’s boot time.

V. EVALUATION

In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of JANUS in
terms of its ability to find bugs in the latest file systems and
achieve higher code coverage than existing file system fuzzers.
In particular, we answer the following questions:

• Q1: How effective is JANUS in discovering previously

unknown bugs in file systems? (§V-A)

• Q2: How effective is JANUS in exploring (1) the state
of file system images, (2) file operations, and (3) the
two-dimensional input space including images and file
operations? (§V-B, §V-C, §V-D)

• Q3: Is the library OS based executor more effective in

reproducing crashes than traditional VMs? (§V-E)

• Q4: Besides finding new bugs, what else can JANUS

contribute to the file system community? (§V-F)

Experimental Setup. We evaluate JANUS on a 2-socket,
24-core machine running Ubuntu 16.04 with Intel Xeon E5-
2670 processors and 256GB memory. We use JANUS to fuzz
file systems in Linux v4.18-rc1, unless otherwise stated. In
particular, we test eight file systems including ext4, XFS, Btrfs,
F2FS, GFS2, HFS+, ReiserFS, and VFAT. We create a seed image
for each file system that has the on-disk file organization shown
in Figure 9 with most features enabled except ext4 and XFS.
For ext4, we create two seed images: one compatible with
ext2/3 and the other with ext4 features. Similarly, we do the
same for XFS representing XFS v4 and XFS v5, which introduces
on-disk checksums to enforce metadata integrity. In total, we
evaluate 10 seed images. In addition, we compare our results
with Syzkaller (commit ID 9be5aa1), which is the state-of-the-

art OS fuzzer. We run Syzkaller with KVM instances, each of
which has two cores and 2GB of memory.

Note that Syzkaller relies on KCOV to profile code coverage,
while JANUS relies on the method of AFL. For an apples-to-
apples comparison between Syzkaller and JANUS, after fuzzing
12 hours, we mount every image mutated by JANUS, and
execute the corresponding program generated by JANUS on a
KCOV-enabled kernel to get the KCOV-style coverage. (see
Appendix §B for the details of AFL- and KCOV- style code
coverage).

A. Bug Discovery in the Upstream File Systems

We intermittently ran JANUS for four months (i.e., from April
2018 to July 2018) to fuzz the aforementioned file systems
in upstream kernels from v4.16 to v4.18. Over the span of
few days to a week, we ran three instances of JANUS to test
each file system. JANUS found 90 unique bugs that resulted in
kernel panics or deadlocks, which we reported to the Linux
kernel community. We differentiated bugs on the basis of
KASAN reports and call stack traces. Among them, developers
confirmed 62 as previously unknown bugs, including 36 in
ext4, XFS, and Btrfs—the three most widely used file systems
on Linux. So far, developers have already fixed 43 bugs with
52 distinct patches, and also assigned 32 CVEs (see Table III).
Another important finding is that some bugs, (e.g., four bugs
related to log recovery in XFS and six bugs about extended
attributes in HFS+) are not going to be fixed by developers in the
near future, as these bugs require large-scale code refactoring.
In addition, ReiserFS developers will not fix five bugs that
lead to the BUG() condition, as ReiserFS is in maintenance
mode.

Note that there are other notable efforts on finding file system

bugs through fuzzing or manual auditing.

• Syzkaller,

the state-of-the-art system call fuzzer that
started to support mutating file system images in March,
2018. Note that Google deployed many more instances
of Syzkaller (i.e., syzbot) than those of JANUS for
continuously fuzzing the upstream kernel. Although syzbot
fuzzes the whole kernel, we found more file system bugs

with JANUS in four months. According to our investigation,
Syzkaller reported only two ext4 bugs, one XFS bug, four
F2FS bugs, and one HFS+ bug during our evaluation period,
among which one of the ext4 bugs, the XFS bug, and the
HFS+ bug were also found by JANUS. JANUS missed one
ext4 bug requiring a 4K block size, which is larger than
that of our seed images. And we started using JANUS to
fuzz F2FS after these four F2FS bugs were fixed.

• Google Project Zero, a team of security researchers
seeking zero-day vulnerabilities who found one ext4 bug
through source review. The bug was also discovered by
JANUS.

• Internal efforts from the file system development com-
munity. XFS developers noticed four XFS bugs found by
JANUS before we reported them. Unfortunately, we were
unable to provide the total number of memory safety
bugs found by developers whose patches cannot easily be
differentiated from the ones for fixing functionalities.
Table VI lists the details of 43 patched bugs that were
previously unknown. The bugs have a wide range of types,
from relatively harmless floating point exceptions to critical
out-of-bound access and heap overflow bugs that can be used
to corrupt critical kernel data and execute arbitrary code with
kernel privileges. Most of the bugs require mounting a corrupted
image followed by particular file operations to trigger, which
are the joint effects from two types of input of a file system
that JANUS manages to explore. In particular, one needs to
invoke three or more system calls to trigger 80% of these bugs,
which indicates the effectiveness of the system call fuzzer.
Moreover, a quarter of the bugs are triggered by mounting only
a corrupted image, which further proves the effectiveness of
JANUS in fuzzing images. As JANUS emphasizes the priority
of mutating image bytes, all the generated test cases contain
the images with error bytes. Therefore, no reported bug only
requires particular file operations without an uncorrupted image
to trigger.
Result.
JANUS successfully found 90 bugs in widely-used
and mature file systems in upstream kernels. Among them,
62 bugs have been confirmed as previously unknown. As a
specialized fuzzer for file systems, JANUS helped the Linux
kernel community to discover and patch more file system bugs
than Syzkaller in recent months.

B. Exploring the State Space of Images

We first evaluate how JANUS mutates image bytes to explore
a target file system by comparing it with Syzkaller. Syzkaller
recently supported mounting mutated images by introducing
a wrapper call: syz_mount_image(), which takes mutated non-
zero segments of an image as input, flushes them into a loop
device at corresponding offsets, and eventually invokes mount().
To evaluate the impact of state space of an input image, we
disable the system call fuzzing stage in JANUS and concentrate
only on fuzzing the image. We denote our image fuzzer as
JANUSi. After a mutated image is mounted, we enforce both
our LKL-based executor, used by JANUSi, and the executor
of Syzkaller (called Syzkalleri) running in a KVM instance to

9

perform a fixed sequence of system calls under the mounting
point (see Figure 13) to demonstrate how mutated image bytes
help fuzzers to explore a file system. We evaluate both fuzzers,
with the seed images of eight file systems, described in the
experimental setup, for 12 hours. For each target file system,
we launch one JANUSi instance and one KVM instance for
Syzkalleri.

Figure 8 presents the number of paths both JANUSi and
Syzkalleri visit in selected file systems. After running for
30 minutes, JANUSi always has higher code coverage than
Syzkalleri. JANUSi outperforms Syzkalleri by 1.47–4.17× for
the evaluated file systems. Note that most selected file systems
have relatively complex implementation, which shows the
ability of JANUS mutating important image bytes to discover
deeper code paths. Our approach differs from Syzkalleri, as
Syzkalleri considers only the important parts of an image as
an array of non-zero chunks, that can either miss metadata
blocks or even include inessential data blocks. By contrast,
JANUSi leverages the semantics of an image, namely locating
and mutating metadata blocks only. In addition, both GFS2
and Btrfs have checksum for metadata blocks, which severely
degrades the performance of Syzkalleri. Another interesting
observation is that Syzkalleri does not correctly use the seed
image for XFS because Syzkaller does not support an image
containing more than 4096 non-contiguous non-zero chunks,
which is one of the big limitations of Syzkaller in fuzzing
file systems. Therefore, Syzkalleri has to generate XFS images
from scratch. Since XFS v5 has metadata checksum, Syzkalleri
cannot make any forward progress even after running for 12
hours, as it does not fix the checksum of metadata.
Result. By mutating metadata blocks and fixing checksums,
JANUSi quickly explores more code paths in the selected file
systems than Syzkalleri when fuzzing only images with fixed
file operations. More specifically, JANUSi achieves at most
4.17× more code coverage than Syzkalleri, which shows the
effectiveness of JANUS when fuzzing only images.

C. Exploring File Operations

We now evaluate the effectiveness of only fuzzing file
operations without mutating the file system image, i.e., we
discard the image fuzzing stage. We denote our file operation
fuzzer as JANUSs, which automatically generates nine seed
programs for mutation after inspecting a seed image, each one
containing an open() system call on a file or directory in the
image (see Figure 9). We compare JANUSs with Syzkallers
by fuzzing 27 file system-specific system calls2 and executing
generated programs on a seed image after being mounted. We
hard-code the paths of all available files and directories on a
seed image in the description file for Syzkallers to fill the values
of certain arguments when fuzzing particular system calls. We
run both of these fuzzers on eight file systems for 12 hours.

2 Syzkallers and JANUSs

fuzz the following system calls: read(),
write(), open(), lseek(), getdents64(), pread64(), pwrite64(), stat(),
lstat(), rename(), fsync(), fdatasync(), access(), ftruncate(), truncate(),
utimes(), mkdir(), rmdir(), link(), unlink(), symlink(), readlink(),
chmod(), setxattr(), fallocate(), listxattr() and removexattr()

As already mentioned, we launch one JANUSs instance and
one KVM instance for Syzkallers in this experiment. Further,
we re-execute all programs generated by JANUSs to obtain
comparable path coverage in KCOV style.

Figure 8 presents the evaluation result, which shows that
with a wiser fuzzing strategy, JANUSs keeps exploring more
code paths than Syzkallers in the span of 12 hours. In particular,
JANUSs eventually visits 2.24×, 1.27×, and 1.25× more unique
code paths than Syzkallers when fuzzing the three most popular
file systems, XFS v5, Btrfs, and ext4, respectively. Moreover,
JANUSs also outperforms Syzkallers 1.72× and 1.49× on HFS+
and GFS2, respectively. By generating context-aware workloads,
we observe that JANUS is more effective than Syzkallers for
fuzzing file systems. The reason is that Syzkallers is a general
and advanced system call fuzzer, but, unlike JANUSs, Syzkallers
completely fails to exploit the domain knowledge of a file
system to explore its code path effectively.
Result. By generating context-aware workloads, JANUS
explores more code paths than Syzkallers in all eight popular
file systems when only targeting the system calls related to
file operations. In particular, the programs generated by JANUS
manage to visit at most 2.24× more paths. The evaluation
result fully demonstrates the effectiveness of JANUS in terms
of file operation fuzzing.

D. Exploring Two-Dimensional Input Space

To demonstrate the comprehensiveness of JANUS’S fuzzing
by mutating both image bytes and file operations, we run
original JANUS and Syzkaller on the eight aforementioned file
systems with the same seed images for 12 hours. We provide
syz_mount_image() in the description file to make Syzkaller
not only generate system calls but also mutate the bytes in a
seed image while invoking 27 file system-specific system calls
(see §V-C). In this experiment, we simultaneously launch three
instances for both JANUS and Syzkaller for parallel fuzzing.
Moreover, both fuzzers share generated test cases for each
corresponding file systems. Figure 8 (marked Syzkaller and
JANUS) shows the results of this experiment.

We observe that JANUS discovers more code paths than both
JANUSi and JANUSs. Our results illustrate the importance of
fuzzing both images and file operations to comprehensively
explore a file system. More important, JANUS further out-
performs Syzkaller on all tested file systems. In particular,
JANUS achieves at most 4.19×, 4.04×, and 3.11× higher code
coverage than Syzkaller when fuzzing Btrfs, GFS2, and F2FS,
respectively. For ext4, JANUS also hits 2.01× more unique
code paths. The major reason is that Syzkaller prioritizes system
call fuzzing over image fuzzing, while JANUS incorporates
the strategy of blob-directed system call fuzzing. For instance,
while generating a program for fuzzing, Syzkaller does not guar-
antee whether a valid file system is mounted before performing
any file operation, i.e., it completely forgoes the file system
context-awareness to blindly fuzz a file system. We mitigate
this issue by invoking umount() and syz_mount_image() at
the beginning of a program. Nevertheless, Syzkaller is still
not capable of stopping if mounting a mutated image fails. In

Fig. 8: The overall path coverage of using Syzkaller and JANUS to fuzz eight file system images for 12 hours. The y-axis represents the
number of unique code paths of each file system visited during the fuzzing process. In particular, JANUSi and Syzkalleri only mutate bytes
on a seed image and perform a fixed sequence of system calls on a mutated image and JANUSi outperforms Syzkalleri up to 4.17×. JANUSs
and Syzkallers generate random system calls to be executed on a fixed seed image, in which JANUSs achieves up to 2.24× higher coverage
than Syzkallers. JANUS and Syzkaller fuzz both image bytes and file operations, and JANUS visits at most 4.19× unique paths.

fact, syz_mount_image() can be invoked anywhere and several
times in a program generated by Syzkaller. Unlike Syzkaller,
JANUS fuzzes each image separately with a clean LKL instance.
If mounting a mutated image succeeds, the executor will
execute context-aware workloads afterward and terminate with
umount(). As we mentioned in §V-B, the comparison for XFS
is partially unfair due to the limitation of Syzkaller in handling
dense images. Another advantage of JANUS is that it utilizes
many fewer CPU and memory resources for LKL instances
but still outperforms Syzkaller, which relies on VMs.

Result.
JANUS achieves higher code coverage than both
JANUSs and JANUSi, which proves the importance of mutating
both images and operations in file system fuzzing. Moreover,

JANUS outperforms Syzkaller on all eight file systems. In
particular, JANUS outperforms Syzkaller at most 4.19× on
Btrfs, one of the popular file systems that has an extremely
complex design. Our evaluation result shows the effectiveness
of JANUS in fuzzing a file system by exploring its two-
dimensional input space.

E. Reproducing Crashes

To evaluate whether the library OS used by JANUS (i.e.,
LKL) helps to reproduce more found crashes compared to

TABLE V: The average time costs of VM-based (i.e., KVM) fuzzer
and JANUS for a non-aging OS and file system. The total time includes
reloading a clean-slate OS and mounting an image.

and a particular sequence of system calls. We then mount
the image and execute system calls under the mounting point
again to see if the kernel crashes. Based on the crashing PC
values, we also count the number of unique crashes among
those reproducible ones. Table IV summarizes the number of
crashes and reproducible ones found by JANUS and Syzkaller.
Note that Syzkaller originally records these numbers in its logs.
Because of the fundamental limitation of using an aging OS, in
which Syzkaller mounts different images and invokes system
calls without initialization, Syzkaller fails to reproduce any of
its found crashes. On the contrary, JANUS can reproduce more
than 95% of crashes found in most file systems, except Btrfs.
Btrfs launches multiple kernel threads completing different
transactions in parallel, which results in non-deterministic
kernel execution. In addition, F2FS and GFS2 also spawns few
worker threads to accomplish particular tasks, such as garbage
collection, logging, etc. Note that, in theory, it is possible
to reproduce 100% of crashes if we can control the thread
scheduling, which is currently outside the scope of this work.
We also estimate the performance overhead of bringing up a
fresh copy of OS (non-aging OS) for a VM-based fuzzer to test
every generated input. More specifically, we evaluate the total
time that a KVM instance (two cores and 2GB memory) spends
on either rebooting VM or reverting an existing snapshot and
testing an input image, and compare it to the corresponding
time that our LKL executor requires. Table V presents the
evaluation result. By simply invoking fork() to launch a new
LKL instance, our LKL-based executor spends negligible time
on setting up a clean OS and a fresh file system compared
with a KVM instance.
Result. LKL, on which JANUS relies, provides a clean-slate
OS that has more stable execution than an OS running in a

VM. This approach results in reproducing most of the crashes.
In particular, JANUS is able to reproduce at least 88% of the
crashes found during a 12-hour fuzzing period. By contrast, a
VM-based fuzzer (i.e., Syzkaller) fails to reproduce any of its
crashes. Moreover, re-initializing OS states in a VM suffers
from unacceptable overhead.

F. Miscellany

Besides finding previously unknown bugs, JANUS contributes
the following notable results to the file system development
community.
Malicious image samples. The development communities of
several file systems including Btrfs, F2FS, etc., have already
added a number of corrupted images generated by JANUS
into their repositories for internal fuzzing and for future
regression testing. Currently, developers consider these images
as representative malicious samples that involve diverse error
bytes in various metadata fields for testing the functionality of
file systems.
General patches for file system hardening. F2FS developers
have not only fixed the bugs reported by us in the kernel
module but also extended corresponding security checks into
the user-space tool (i.e., fsck.f2fs) to help users detect these
image corruptions in advance, i.e., before the Linux kernel
mounts images containing critical error bytes.

VI. DISCUSSION

We have demonstrated that JANUS effectively explores the
code paths and discovers unknown bugs in a disk file system
in the Linux kernel. We now discuss the limitations of JANUS
and our future directions.
Library OS based executor. JANUS relies on LKL to test in-
kernel file systems. In fact, other OS fuzzers can use it to test
other kernel sub-systems, except MMU-dependent components.
For instance, JANUS cannot fuzz the DAX mode of a file
system [31] without modification on LKL. We could also use
user-mode Linux (UML), as done by Oracle’s kernel fuzzer [48].
However, UML suffers from the limitation of its multi-process
design, which complicates the spotting of a kernel crash and
termination of all its processes during each iteration. Therefore,
UML does not support fuzzing the kernel as a user application
well.
Minimal PoC generator. An ideal PoC for developers to
debug crashes consists of an image that only has essential error
bytes and a program with the least file operations. To achieve
this, JANUS currently uses a brute force approach to revert
every mutated byte and also tries to remove every invoked
file operation to check whether the kernel still crashes at the
expected location. Although this approach is sub-optimal, we
can leverage certain file system utilities such as fsck and
debugfs and system call trace distillation techniques [22, 49]
to pinpoint root-causing bytes and system calls. Another
possibility is to apply taint tracking on the kernel.
Fuzzing FUSE drivers. Currently, JANUS does not support
file systems (e.g., NTFS [70], GVfs [67], SSHFS [55], etc.)

12

that rely on FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) [32]. We can
easily extend the fuzzing engine of JANUS to fuzz such file
systems as long as they store user data in a disk image and
support certain file operations for users to interact with data.
Fuzzing file system utilities. Developers heavily rely on
system utilities (e.g., mkfs, fsck, etc.), to manage file systems.
For instance, Linux automatically launches fsck for recovering
disk data from a sudden system crash. Moreover, users use
fsck to check the consistency of an untrusted disk image before
mounting the disk. Hence, developers desire such utilities to
be bug free. We believe that developers can easily extend the
image mutator of JANUS to generate corrupted images for
fuzzing these tools, thereby improving their robustness. In fact,
we use JANUS to find two unknown bugs in fsck.ext4, and
one has already been fixed.
Extending to fuzz file systems on other OSes. Extending
JANUS for fuzzing in-kernel file systems on other OSes will be
straightforward if the corresponding library OS solution exists.
For instance, Drawbridge [52] enables Windows to efficiently
run in a process. Moreover, we can also integrate the core
fuzzing engine of JANUS with other general kernel fuzzing
frameworks such as kAFL [61] built upon QEMU and KVM
to fuzz file systems used by other commodity OSes such as
Windows and macOS.
Improving other file system testing tools. The goal of JANUS
is to find general security bugs in file systems, contrary to the
goals of other tools, including crash-consistency checkers [6,
73] and semantic correctness checkers [36, 58]. However, these
tools also need sequences of file operations. Hence, JANUS
becomes a one-stop solution on which other tools can rely.

VII. RELATED WORK

Structured input fuzzing. Numerous approaches have been
proposed to fuzz inputs that are highly structured like file
system images. Unlike JANUS, a number of generation fuzzers
( [14, 23, 41, 42, 50]) construct syntactically correct inputs
from scratch based on input specifications described through
manual efforts. Furthermore, EXE [7] relies on symbolic
execution to build valid inputs that satisfy deep path constraints.
More advanced approaches such as [3, 16, 24] learn the
input structures from a set of samples. On the other side,
mutation-based fuzzers [4, 5, 10, 15, 18, 34, 76] generate new
inputs by mutating valid samples. The generated inputs have
correct structures with slight errors, and hopefully trigger bugs.
Considering the complexity of a file system image and the
diversity in image format among different file systems, JANUS
adopts mutation-based strategies to fuzz images. Similar to
file system images, many file formats involve checksums for
integrity checks. JANUS specifically fixes metadata checksums
with expertise knowledge. Nevertheless, some checksum-aware
fuzzers [33, 71] identify checksum fields and bypass checksum
checks at runtime through dynamic taint analysis.
OS kernel fuzzers. To find security bugs in OSes, a number
of general kernel fuzzing frameworks
[20, 43, 46, 61] and
[22, 25, 44, 45, 47] have been
OS-specific kernel fuzzers

proposed. Unlike JANUS, all these fuzzers generate random
system calls based upon predefined grammar rules, which is
ineffective in the context of file system fuzzing. Several recent
OS fuzzers such as IMF [22] and MoonShine [49] focusing
on seed distillation are orthogonal to this work. Nevertheless,
JANUS can start with seed programs of high quality by utilizing
their approaches.
File system semantic correctness checkers.
JUXTA [36]
and SibylFS [58] are other types of file system checkers, that
aim to find whether the implementation of a file system exactly
meets the standard (e.g., the POSIX standard, man pages,
etc.) through static analysis and high-level modeling of file
system behaviors. They are orthogonal to JANUS regarding their
purposes and methodologies. Similarly, JANUS can generate
meaningful system calls to find crash consistency bugs [6, 73].
File system abstraction. Several studies [65, 66] propose
general
interfaces for file system utilities to access and
manipulate the on-disk metadata of various file systems through
high-level abstraction. By utilizing these interfaces, JANUS
can compress disk images in a more general manner without
implementing an image parser for every target file system.

VIII. CONCLUSION

In this work, we propose JANUS, an evolutionary file system
fuzzer, that explores an in-kernel file system by exploring its
two-dimensional input space (i.e., images and file operations).
Unlike existing file system fuzzers, JANUS efficiently mutates
metadata blocks of input images while emitting context-aware
workloads on an image. Rather than traditional VMs, JANUS
relies on a library OS that supports fast reloading to test
OS functionalities, thereby avoiding unstable executions and
irreproducible bugs. We reported 90 bugs found by JANUS
in the upstream kernel, 43 of which have been fixed with 32
CVEs assigned. JANUS outperforms Syzkaller by exploring at
most 4.19× more code paths when fuzzing popular file systems
for 12 hours and manages to reproduce 88–100% of found
crashes. We will open source our implementation of JANUS,
which has been requested by several file system development
communities due to our notable results. We believe that JANUS
will be one-stop solution for file system testing, as JANUS
can act as a basic infrastructure to design new semantic and
crash-consistency checkers for file systems.

AFL and KCOV used to support Syzkaller apply two different approaches to
instrument a fuzzing target and reserve runtime path coverage in two different
formats. In particular, AFL labels every basic block with a random number,
and at each branch, the code shown in Figure 10 is instrumented. Each byte
set in the bitmap can be considered as a hit on a particular code path.

KCOV relies on the -fsanitize-coverage=trace-pc flag of GCC (>= 6.0)
to inject code at every basic block which emits the current PC value into
a buffer mapped in user space. After the execution for a mutated input is
completed, Syzkaller uses every two consequent PC values to calculate out a
hash value to represent a particular code path (see Figure 10).

Note that Syzkaller uses the lowest 32 bits of a PC value to label the
corresponding basic block, which has lower randomness compared to pseudo
random numbers generated by AFL and thereby results in more collisions that
degrade the fuzzing performance.

C. An LKL Example

Figure 11 provides a simple example of leveraging LKL in an user

application to operate an ext4 image.

D. Serialization Format

JANUS serializes a generate program along with the speculated image status

into a binary file by following the format described in Figure 12.

E. A Testing Program for Image Fuzzing

Figure 13 presents a fixed sequence of system calls to be performed on
any mutated image when evaluating the effectiveness of JANUS and Syzkaller
in image fuzzing.

F. Supported System Calls

In our implementation, JANUS supports generating and mutating the follow-
ing 34 system calls: read(), write(), open(), seek(), mmap(), getdents64(),
pread64(), pwrite64(), stat(), lstat(), rename(), fsync(), fdatasync(),
syncfs(), sendfile(), access(), ftruncate(), truncate(), fstat(), statfs(),
fstatfs(), utimes(), mkdir(), rmdir(), link(), unlink(), symlink(),
readlink(), chmod(), fchmod(), setxattr(), fallocate(), listxattr(), and
removexattr().

G. File system bugs found by JANUS

Table VI lists the patched bugs found by JANUS in five widely used file

systems that were previously unknown.

TABLE VI: The list of previously unknown bugs in widely used file systems found by JANUS that have already been fixed in Linux kernel
v4.16, v4.17, and v4.18. We are still waiting for CVE assignment for several confirmed bugs. For security concerns, we exclude other 19
found bugs that developers have not fixed. The rightmost column, Conditions, indicates what components of JANUS contribute to discovering
the bugs. I means that triggering the bug only requires mounting a mutated image. I+S represents that the bug is triggered by mounting a
mutated image and also invoking specific system calls.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

btrfs: merge btrfs\_find\_device and find\_deviceBoth btrfs\_find\_device() and find\_device() does the same thing except
that the latter does not take the seed device onto account in the device
scanning context. We can merge them.

# USN-4287-2: Linux kernel (Azure) vulnerabilities

18 February 2020

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

USN-4287-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1069-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.15.0-1069.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.15.0-1069.74~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.15.0.1069.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.15.0-1069.74~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
