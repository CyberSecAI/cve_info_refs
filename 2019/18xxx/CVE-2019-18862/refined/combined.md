| [Description](#c0)  Mike Gualtieri    2019-11-20 19:19:55 UTC  ``` The --url parameter included in the GNU Mailutils maidag utility (versions 2.0 through 3.7) can abused to write to arbitrary files on the host operating system.  By default, maidag is set to execute with setuid root permissions, which can lead to local privilege escalation through code/command execution by writing to the system's crontab or by writing to other root owned files on the operating system.  This issue has been fixed in mailutils 3.8.  A patch has also been offered for 3.7 (see URL submitted with this bug).  The flaw has been assigned CVE-2019-18862.  Reproducible: Always  Steps to Reproduce: 1. Install mailutils  Actual Results:   The --url parameter of maidag can be used to write to arbitrary files due to the default setuid permissions. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2020-03-01 13:04:07 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2020-03-02 12:28:26 UTC  ``` arm stable ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2020-03-02 12:32:11 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2020-03-02 12:39:43 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sergei Trofimovich (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2020-03-02 14:18:06 UTC  ``` ia64 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2020-03-02 15:23:07 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Mart Raudsepp   gentoo-dev  2020-03-28 22:37:45 UTC  ``` fwiw, some arm64 USE=kerberos builds are failing, but not all.
