  "description": "The --url parameter included in the GNU Mailutils maidag utility (versions 2.0 through 3.7) can abused to write to arbitrary files on the host operating system. By default, maidag is set to execute with setuid root permissions, which can lead to local privilege escalation through code/command execution by writing to the system's crontab or by writing to other root owned files on the operating system. This issue has been fixed in mailutils 3.8.",
