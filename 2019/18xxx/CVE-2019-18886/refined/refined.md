{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application had inconsistent behavior when handling switch user requests. It responded differently depending on whether the target user existed or not. This allowed an attacker to enumerate valid user accounts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "User enumeration vulnerability",
       "Inconsistent error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could enumerate valid user accounts within the application by observing the difference in responses when attempting to switch to existing versus non-existing users, potentially enabling further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application's switch user functionality. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability."
