Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-18271:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue that can be introduced on the PI Vision administration site.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to potentially perform unauthorized actions if a user with sufficient permissions clicks on a malicious link or visits a malicious website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF exploit could lead to a low impact on confidentiality and high impact on availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (AV:N).
- The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) where the victim clicks on a malicious link or interacts with a malicious website.
- No privileges are required (PR:N), but the victim needs to have valid credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to induce a user to perform an action (click on a link or visit a website) that submits a crafted request to the vulnerable PI Vision application.
- The attacker needs no special privileges but requires knowledge of the application's endpoints.
