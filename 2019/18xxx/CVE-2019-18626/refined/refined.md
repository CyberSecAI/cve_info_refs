Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which is indeed related to CVE-2019-18626:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of access control on the `ORMEDMIS/Data/PY/T4W2Service.svc/RetrieveW2EntriesForEmployee` URI. This URI is intended to provide W-2 information for a specified employee, but it does not properly restrict which user can request information for a given employee.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `empNo` parameter in the JSON request is used directly to fetch W-2 information without any validation or authorization checks to ensure the requesting user is permitted to view the information associated with the requested `empNo`.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The lack of proper authorization allows an authenticated user to view sensitive information of other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** An attacker can access sensitive employee information, including:
    *   Tax information (W-2 data)
    *   Social Security numbers
    *   Home addresses
    *   Potentially other personal details

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** An attacker can send crafted JSON requests to the vulnerable URI (`ORMEDMIS/Data/PY/T4W2Service.svc/RetrieveW2EntriesForEmployee`), manipulating the `empNo` parameter to access the W-2 data of any user.
*   **Iterative Attack:** An attacker can iterate through possible `empNo` values to extract W-2 information for all users of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Harris Ormed Self Service application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to send requests to the vulnerable URI.

**Additional Details (Beyond CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability is described as "pre-auth" which is incorrect as the attacker needs to be authenticated.
*   The specific vulnerable endpoint and parameter are named (`ORMEDMIS/Data/PY/T4W2Service.svc/RetrieveW2EntriesForEmployee`, `empNo`).
*   The fix is stated as being in patch `2019.1.4` from November 2019.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jake Rawlins and Joel Hopwood.
*   The timeline of disclosure is provided.
