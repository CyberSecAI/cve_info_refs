  "vulnerability": {
    "id": "CVE-2019-18196",
    "description": "A DLL preloading vulnerability in the TeamViewer Windows client (versions 11 to 14) where a Microsoft Windows system DLL could load potentially untrusted DLLs from the application directory into the service process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `ws2_32.dll` library loading `mswsock.dll`, which in turn attempts to load `wshtcpip.dll` using LoadLibraryExW without proper flags, leading to an uncontrolled search path and the potential loading of malicious DLLs from the application directory. Additionally, there's a lack of signature validation on loaded DLLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Search Path",
       "Lack of DLL Signature Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could achieve persistence and potentially defense evasion by loading and executing malicious payloads within the context of the signed TeamViewer service process (NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM). This could be used for application whitelisting bypass.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in the TeamViewer application directory. When the TeamViewer service starts, it will attempt to load the malicious DLL.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the system to place the malicious DLL in the TeamViewer application directory."
