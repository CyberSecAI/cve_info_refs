**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it on a web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

    - Redirection: An attacker could redirect users to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack through a crafted web request to the affected application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the application and be able to inject malicious input.
- Requires high privileges on the target system.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Affected Product:**
- PI Vision 2017 R2 and PI Vision 2017 R2 SP1.
