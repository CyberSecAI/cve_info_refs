  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "root_cause": "Insecure file upload and local file inclusion vulnerabilities due to lack of proper input validation and sanitization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Arbitrary File Upload: The application allows uploading files without proper validation, allowing attackers to upload malicious files, such as PHP shells.",
        "Local File Inclusion (LFI): The application includes files based on user-supplied input, without sanitization. This allows attackers to include arbitrary files on the server."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution, sensitive information disclosure. An attacker can upload a malicious file like a PHP shell, then execute it via LFI. The LFI can also expose sensitive system files and configuration files.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the /cgi-bin/up.cgi endpoint with a file to upload.",
        "HTTP GET request to the application with the 'op' and 'tmpl' parameters to perform LFI."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. For the arbitrary file upload, the attacker must be able to craft a multipart/form-data request containing the file and the necessary parameters. For LFI, the attacker needs to craft a URL with the vulnerable parameters. The attacker does not need any special privileges."
