{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A malformed HTTP request without a Host header triggers an internally generated 'Invalid request' response. This response is then processed by the configured encoder filter chain. If an encoder filter within this chain attempts to access the request's Host header via route manager APIs, it leads to a NULL pointer dereference because the Host header is missing.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "Abnormal termination of the Envoy process, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a malformed HTTP request without a 'Host' header to the Envoy proxy."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Envoy instance, which is typically accessible over the network.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is triggered by encoder filters that use route manager APIs that access the Host header. Mitigation involves disabling such filters (e.g., LUA filters or vendor-specific filters). Detection can be performed by looking for abnormal terminations of the Envoy proxy process and stack traces containing `Envoy::Router::RouteMatcher::findVirtualHost()`."
