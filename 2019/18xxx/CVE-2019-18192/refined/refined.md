- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The profile directory in GNU Guix was world-writable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure permissions on the profile directory, allowing any user to write to it.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user could populate the profile of another user, even if that user has never logged in to the machine. This could lead to various attacks, such as arbitrary code execution, by injecting malicious executables or configuration files into the profile.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable locally. An attacker needs to have local access to the machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be a local user on the system running a vulnerable version of GNU Guix. They do not need any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
