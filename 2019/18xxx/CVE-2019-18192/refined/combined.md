Subject: CVE-2019-18192: Insecure permissions on Guix profile directory

Hello,

GNU Guix is a transactional package manager and associated GNU/Linux
distribution.

Similar to what Michael Orlitzky reported for Nix (CVE-2019-17365),
the profile directory in GNU Guix would be world-writable, allowing a
malicious user to populate the profile of a user that has never logged
in on the machine.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2019-18192 and affects all versions of
Guix up to 1.0.1 included.  The fix is similar to that written for Nix
by Eelco Dolstra (the build daemon of Guix derives from that of Nix).
It can be deployed via ‘guix pull’ as specified in the announcement below.
