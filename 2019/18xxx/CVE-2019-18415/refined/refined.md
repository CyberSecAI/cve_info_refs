- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Restaurant Management System 1.0 suffers from a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). The application is vulnerable in multiple input fields such as the 'Message' field and 'Last Name' field, where it reflects unsanitized user inputs into the web page.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can exploit the XSS vulnerability to perform session hijacking. By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can steal the administrator's session cookie. With the stolen cookie, the attacker can take over the administrator account and access the management interface.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors are the vulnerable input fields of the application. Specifically, the "Message" field and "Last Name" field are used as entry points for injecting the XSS payload. The injected script is executed when the page displaying the user input is loaded by another user.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability either with an authenticated account or without any account, by exploiting either the Message or Last Name fields respectively. The attacker needs to craft a malicious XSS payload and inject it into the vulnerable field. Then, the attacker needs to have a handler set up to catch the session cookie when the malicious script is executed in the victim's browser, thus allowing the attacker to use the cookie to hijack the session.
