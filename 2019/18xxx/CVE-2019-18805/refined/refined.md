{
  "CVE-2019-18805": {
    "description": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel's TCP subsystem while calculating packet round trip time, when the sysctl parameter /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen is set incorrectly. This can lead to a denial of service (DOS) attack.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer overflow in the `tcp_ack_update_rtt` function in `net/ipv4/tcp_input.c`. This occurs when a large value is written to the sysctl parameter `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen`, leading to an integer overflow during round trip time calculations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can cause a Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": "A local attacker can trigger this vulnerability by writing a large integer to the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen` sysctl parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to write to the `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen` sysctl parameter, which typically requires root privileges or elevated user rights."
