The provided content contains multiple advisories for CVE-2019-18229, all related to SQL injection vulnerabilities in Advantech WISE-PaaS/RMM. Each advisory details a specific vulnerable class and function.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerabilities are present in various classes and functions of the Advantech WISE-PaaS/RMM software, specifically within the SQLMgmt, DeviceMgmt, RecoveryMgmt, and ProtectionMgmt classes. The following functions are affected:
- `CreateTable`
- `delData`
- `fuzzySearch` (in DeviceMgmt, RecoveryMgmt, and ProtectionMgmt classes)
- `insertData`
- `qryData`
- `updateData`
- `getTableInfo`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information from the Postgres database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attackers require the ability to send network requests to the affected service.
- Although authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. This suggests that the bypass may be trivial or involve another weakness.

**Summary of specific vulnerabilities**

*   **SQLMgmt CreateTable SQL Injection Information Disclosure Vulnerability** (ZDI-19-956)
