Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-18339:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The HTTP service of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server has an authentication bypass vulnerability. This means an attacker can circumvent the normal authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication checks before allowing access to critical functions of the video server's HTTP service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to read the SiVMS/SiNVR users database, including user passwords.
*   **Password Exposure:** The passwords are not stored securely but in an "obfuscated cleartext" format, which is easily reversible.
*   **Full Compromise Potential:** With access to user credentials, an attacker could gain full access to the video server and related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable video server's HTTP service (default port 5401/tcp).
*   **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, without needing local access to the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the video server.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability initially, as this is an authentication bypass.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects all SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server versions prior to V5.0.0.
*   The issue was reported by RaphaÃ«l Rigo from Airbus Security Lab.
*   A fix for this specific vulnerability is available in versions 5.0.0 and later from PKE.
*   Siemens recommends applying ACL/firewall configuration and ensuring correct Authorization Server settings as mitigations.
