## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

Package        : tnef
Version        : 1.4.9-1+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18849
Debian Bug     : 944851

In tnef, an attacker may be able to write to the victim's
.ssh/authorized_keys file via an e-mail message with a crafted
winmail.dat application/ms-tnef attachment, because of a heap-based
buffer over-read involving strdup.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
1.4.9-1+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your tnef packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

### @pauldreik **[pauldreik](/pauldreik)** commented [Oct 31, 2019](#issue-515496281) • edited Loading

A buffer read overflow may happen at

[file.c line 236](https://github.com/verdammelt/tnef/blob/75b21463f6dc238a10b8bb49cef6a4eb0716f292/src/file.c#L236) where strdup() is invoked.

strdup() will just search until it finds a null terminator. If there was none, it will continue past the heap allocated memory. (Update 20191110: there is another one in mapi\_attr.c, see [3ae8b93](https://github.com/verdammelt/tnef/commit/3ae8b93746aa6403420b9907886993ceaa6705e3))

The effect of this read overflow is that either the

application crashes from a segfault, or "random" data is being

duplicated, the effect of which I do not know. Writing a file with

garbage suffixed to the name, perhaps, but there seem to be some kind of

sanitation in path.c preventing that.

Update: there is another similar situation in mapi\_attr.c, also fixed in this pull request.

An example input that triggers the behaviour is base64 encoded here:

| Instead of changing the interface of xcalloc/xmalloc can we just have that the extra ADDNULL macros which `+1` to the provided length - or in the two places called simply `+1` there? I'd rather just do that. |

| I started with the +1 approach, but that is dangerous since it creates a possibility for integer overflow on the call site. See here: [7109b9e](https://github.com/verdammelt/tnef/commit/7109b9ec57c9f41362220a78ad488d92af61b987)  Also, it will make the tests break since they check the debug output compared to the checked in output from an earlier version.  Then I moved the "+1 functionality" inside the xcalloc call: [375d20f](https://github.com/verdammelt/tnef/commit/375d20fe753e27c6798f5d73bab647f2b27e3bdc) The functionality for safely checking for integer overflow is inside that function.  I understand you do not like it, it is pretty ugly, but at least it is correct.  You can implement this however you prefer, I am happy as long as the end result is free of undefined behaviour, buffer overflows and integer overflows! |

| [@verdammelt](https://github.com/verdammelt) can you comment on what the consequence could be of this bug? I would say opening a crafted file could lead to a file with a weird filename may be created on the system, but could that weird file name end up being in another directory (say ../../.ssh/authorized\_keys if the heap could be prepared)? |

| Yes, it seems perhaps with a specially constructed file you could get files written to unexpected locations or with contents not as expected.  I don't know how easy it would be to do either - but it seems that this bug would make that possible. |

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 31 on 2020-11-24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '31'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 31 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1771892#c13)  Ben Cotton    2020-11-24 20:26:15 UTC  ``` Fedora 31 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2020-11-24.

2. [fix shift into sign bit](/verdammelt/tnef/commit/293596a15ceb789aa7fb0bfa97c545c73769f3ef)
    …

   ```
   The intermediate uint8 is implicitly promoted to an int before shifting,
   shifting into the sign bit is undefined behaviour in C.

   The compiler does not seem to exploit this, for gcc at least, the
   generated code is identical.
   ```

    …

   ```
   this relaxes the memory limit check, so one byte extra
   may be allowed, after the check vs the limit the user sets.

* [tnef](/security/cves?package=tnef) - Tool to unpack MIME application/ms-tnef attachments

## Details

Paul Dreik discovered that TNEF incorrectly handled filenames. If a user

were tricked into opening a specially crafted email attachment, an

attacker could possibly use this issue to write arbitrary files to the

filesystem or cause TNEF crash, resulting in a denial of service.

([CVE-2019-18849](/security/CVE-2019-18849))
