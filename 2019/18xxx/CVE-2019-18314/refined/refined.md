- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication when handling RMI requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application server is vulnerable to remote code execution via sending crafted objects via RMI due to missing authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve remote code execution on the application server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the application server is required. The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted objects through the RMI interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have network access to the application server. No authentication is needed.
