Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Key material is inadvertently logged by the Stealth Solution under certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive key material is written to log files. This violates the principle of least privilege and exposes confidential information.
- The vulnerability is classified under CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of key material allows for potential misuse of the affected system.
-  High confidentiality impact, as resources normally inaccessible are exposed.
- High integrity impact, as illegitimate access can be achieved.
- High availability impact as a successful attack could result in loss of access to resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access to specialized log files is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system
- Administrator privileges to access internal log files.
- Ability to work backward to create their own version of the Unisys negotiation protocol to interpret the logged data.

**Additional Information:**

*   The CVSS base score was increased from 5.3 to 7.5 due to re-evaluation of the security impact.
*   The scope of the vulnerability is changed because exploitation affects resources beyond the intended privileges.
*   The vulnerability affects Stealth Solution versions 3.4.108.0, 3.4.209.x, 4.0.027.x and 4.0.114.
*   The issue is resolved in Stealth levels 4.0.131 and 5.0.024.2 (and higher).
