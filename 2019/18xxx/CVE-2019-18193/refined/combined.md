| | Vulnerability Report - Key Material Inadvertently Logged | | --- |      |  | | | --- | --- | |  | | | Unisys ID: | **UIS-2019-2** | | Status: | Published | | CVE-ID: | CVE-2019-18193 | | Affected Product: | Stealth Solution | | Affected Version: | 3.4.108.0, 3.4.209.x, 4.0.027.x and 4.0.114 | | Impact: | HIGH | | CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 | | CVSS v3.1 Vector: | **AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:U/RL:O/RC:C**  [v3 Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) | | CVSS v2.0 Base Score: | 6.6 | | CVSS v2.0 Vector: | **(AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:U/RL:OF/RC:C)**  [v2 Calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v2-calculator) | | CVSS Temporal Score: | 6.5 | | --- | --- | | Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE): | 532 | | Common Platform Enumeration (CPE): |  | | Source: | Internal Reported | | Keyword(s): | Logging | | Vulnerability Description: | | | Key Material Inadvertently Logged | | | System Configuration: | | | Issue is present in Stealth(core) levels 3.4.108.0, 3.4.209.x, 4.0.027.x and 4.0.114 under certain conditions. | | | Impact of Exploiting Vulnerability: | | | Key material is visible, allowing potential misuse. | | | Remediation Description: | | | Fix included in Stealth levels 4.0.131 and 5.0.024.2 (and higher) | | | Workaround Information: | | |  | | | References: | | | PLEs 19269086 and 19269094 | | | Additional Vendor Comment: | | | CVSS base score increased from 5.3 to 7.5 due to reanalysis of security impact if attacker was to gain access to protected resources. See the explanation below for details:  "Exploitability:  Attack vector would be **Local** since local access to specialized logs is required.  Attack complexity would be **High** since the attacker would need to work backwards to create their own version of the Unisys negotiation protocol.  Privileges Required would be **High** since the attacker would need administrator privileges to access internal log files  User Interaction would be **None** since no user interaction (other than an attacker) is required.  Scope would be **Changed** since the exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the privileges intended by the vulnerable component.  Impact metrics:  Confidentiality loss would be **High** since resources normally inaccessible would be exposed to the attacker.  Integrity Impact would be **High** because there’d be a loss of integrity via illegitimate access.  Availability Impact would be **High** since a successful attack could result in loss of access to resources. | |  |  | | --- |  |  | | --- | |  | | |  | | *Disclaimer:*  *Unisys Corporation provides the information in this Security Vulnerability Report “AS IS.” No warranties of any nature are extended by or for the information.
