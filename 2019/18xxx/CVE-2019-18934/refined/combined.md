# Unbound 1.9.5 released

Published: Tue 19 November 2019

Last updated: Mon 20 January 2025

We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.9.5 of the Unbound
recursive DNS resolver.

This release is a fix for vulnerability CVE-2019-18934 that can cause shell
code execution after receiving a specially crafted answer. This issue can only
be triggered when *all* of the below conditions are met:

* unbound was compiled with --enable-ipsecmod support, and
* ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration (either in the
  configuration file or using unbound-control), and
* a domain is part of the ipsecmod-whitelist (if ipsecmod-whitelist is
  used), and
* unbound receives an A/AAAA query for a domain that has an A/AAAA
  record(s) *and* an IPSECKEY record(s) available.

The shell code execution can then happen if either the qname or the
gateway field of the IPSECKEY (when gateway type == 3) contain a
specially crafted domain name.

We would like to thank X41 D-Sec for notifying us about this
vulnerability and OSTIF for sponsoring the Unbound security audit.

=== Content from nlnetlabs.nl_afaa6f82_20250121_012943.html ===
The CVE number for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-18934
== Summary
Recent versions of Unbound contain a vulnerability that can cause shell
code execution after receiving a specially crafted answer. This issue
can only be triggered if unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod`
support, and ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration.
== Affected products
Unbound 1.6.4 up to and including 1.9.4.
== Description
Due to unsanitized characters passed to the ipsecmod-hook shell command,
it is possible for Unbound to allow shell code execution from a
specially crafted IPSECKEY answer.
This issue can only be triggered when \*all\* of the below conditions are met:
\* unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod` support, and
\* ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration (either in the
configuration file or using `unbound-control`), and
\* a domain is part of the ipsecmod-whitelist (if ipsecmod-whitelist is
used), and
\* unbound receives an A/AAAA query for a domain that has an A/AAAA
record(s) \*and\* an IPSECKEY record(s) available.
The shell code execution can then happen if either the qname or the
gateway field of the IPSECKEY (when gateway type == 3) contain a
specially crafted domain name.
== Solution
Download patched version of Unbound, or apply the patch manually.
+ Downloading patched version
Unbound 1.9.5 is released with the patch
https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/unbound-1.9.5.tar.gz
+ Applying the Patch manually
For Unbound 1.6.4 up to and including 1.9.4 the patch is:
https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/patch\_cve\_2019-18934.diff
Apply the patch on the Unbound source directory with:
'patch -p1 < patch\_cve\_2019-18934.diff'
then run 'make install' to install Unbound.
== Acknowledgments
We would like to thank X41 D-Sec for notifying us about this
vulnerability and OSTIF for sponsoring the Unbound security audit.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1157268#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2019-11-20 08:35:07 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-18934  Unbound 1.6.4 through 1.9.4 contain a vulnerability in the ipsec module that can cause shell code execution after receiving a specially crafted answer. This issue can only be triggered if unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod` support, and ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-a29e620cd4
2019-12-18 01:52:04.721403
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : unbound
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.9.6
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <https://www.unbound.net/>
Summary : Validating, recursive, and caching DNS(SEC) resolver
Description :
Unbound is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS(SEC) resolver.

The C implementation of Unbound is developed and maintained by NLnet
Labs. It is based on ideas and algorithms taken from a java prototype
developed by Verisign labs, Nominet, Kirei and ep.net.

Unbound is designed as a set of modular components, so that also
DNSSEC (secure DNS) validation and stub-resolvers (that do not run
as a server, but are linked into an application) are easily possible.

Subject: CVE-2019-18934 Unbound: Vulnerability in IPSEC module

Hi,

Below is a copy of Unbound's CVE description that can be found at
<https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2019-18934.txt>

Regards,
Ralph

==

The CVE number for this vulnerability is CVE-2019-18934

== Summary
Recent versions of Unbound contain a vulnerability that can cause shell
code execution after receiving a specially crafted answer. This issue
can only be triggered if unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod`
support, and ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration.

== Affected products
Unbound 1.6.4 up to and including 1.9.4.

== Description
Due to unsanitized characters passed to the ipsecmod-hook shell command,
it is possible for Unbound to allow shell code execution from a
specially crafted IPSECKEY answer.

This issue can only be triggered when *all* of the below conditions are met:
* unbound was compiled with `--enable-ipsecmod` support, and
* ipsecmod is enabled and used in the configuration (either in the
  configuration file or using `unbound-control`), and
* a domain is part of the ipsecmod-whitelist (if ipsecmod-whitelist is
  used), and
* unbound receives an A/AAAA query for a domain that has an A/AAAA
  record(s) *and* an IPSECKEY record(s) available.

The shell code execution can then happen if either the qname or the
gateway field of the IPSECKEY (when gateway type == 3) contain a
specially crafted domain name.

== Solution
Download patched version of Unbound, or apply the patch manually.

+ Downloading patched version
Unbound 1.9.5 is released with the patch
<https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/unbound-1.9.5.tar.gz>

+ Applying the Patch manually
For Unbound 1.6.4 up to and including 1.9.4 the patch is:
<https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/patch_cve_2019-18934.diff>

Apply the patch on the Unbound source directory with:
'patch -p1 < patch_cve_2019-18934.diff'
then run 'make install' to install Unbound.

== Acknowledgments
We would like to thank X41 D-Sec for notifying us about this
vulnerability and OSTIF for sponsoring the Unbound security audit.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1171889#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-05-19 15:57:20 UTC  ``` through oss   Hello,  Below is a copy of Unbound's CVE description that can be found at <https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2020-12662_2020-12663.txt>  Regards, Ralph  ==  Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Unbound: CVE-2020-12662 and CVE-2020-12663.  == Summary = CVE-2020-12662 Unbound can be tricked into amplifying an incoming query into a large number of queries directed to a target.  = CVE-2020-12663 Malformed answers from upstream name servers can be used to make Unbound unresponsive.  == Affected products All version of Unbound up to and including 1.10.0  == Description = CVE-2020-12662 Researchers from Tel Aviv University discovered an issue in Unbound and other DNS resolvers that makes it possible to have a single incoming query result in a large number of outgoing queries. This amplification makes it possible for Unbound to be used in a denial of service attack. The researchers discovering this called this attack the NXNSattack.  This attack makes use of cache bypassing using random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records. When these delegation records are received during iteration, and the answer does not contain glue records, a resolver has to send out a query to the get the IP address for one of the names. When this query fails (for example because the random name does not exist) a resolver will try the next one. A large set of NS records with random names can result in a large number of outgoing queries going to the same target. More details about this attack are available in the research paper, available at <http://www.nxnsattack.com/>.  = CVE-2020-12663 Fuzzing of the Unbound code made us aware of issues in the parser of received answers. Malformed answers received from upstream servers can result in Unbound entering an infinite loop and thereby becoming unresponsive. When compiled with --enable-debug it is also possible to trigger an assertion, resulting in Unbound to crash.  == Solution Download patched version of Unbound, or apply the patch manually.  + Downloading patched version Unbound 1.10.1 is released with the patch <https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/unbound-1.10.1.tar.gz>  + Applying the Patch manually For Unbound 1.10.0 the patch is: <https://nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/patch_cve_2020-12662_2020-12663.diff>  Apply the patch containing fixes for both issues, using: 'patch -p1 < patch_cve_2020-12662_2020-12663.diff' then run 'make install' to install Unbound.  == Acknowledgments We would like to thank Lior Shafir, Yehuda Afek, and Anat Bremler-Barr from Tel Aviv University for their work on the NXNSattack.  We would like to thank the OSS-Fuzz project for the discoveries resulting in CVE-2020-12663. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1171889#c1)  Robert Frohl   2020-06-17 12:55:40 UTC  ``` regarding CVE-2020-12662: was not fixed competently by RedHat and got a new CVE assigned: CVE-2020-10772 [0].

27 August 2018: Wouter - Set defaults to yes for a number of options to increase speed and resilience of the server. The so-reuseport, harden-below-nxdomain, and minimal-responses options are enabled by default. They used to be disabled by default, waiting to make sure they worked. They are enabled by default now, and can be disabled explicitly by setting them to "no" in the unbound.conf config file. The reuseport and minimal options increases speed of the server, and should be otherwise harmless. The harden-below-nxdomain option works well together with the recently default enabled qname minimisation, this causes more fetches to use information from the cache. - next release is called 1.8.0. - Fix lintflags for lint on FreeBSD.
22 August 2018: George - #4140: Expose repinfo (comm\_reply) to the inplace\_callbacks.

17 August 2018: Ralph - Fix classification for QTYPE=CNAME queries when QNAME minimisation is enabled.
17 August 2018: Wouter - Set libunbound to increase current, because the libunbound change to the event callback function signature. That needs programs, that use it, to recompile against the new header definition. - print servfail info to log as error. - added more servfail printout statements, to the iterator. - log-servfail: yes prints log lines that say why queries are returning SERVFAIL to clients.

From Guido Shanahan. - Patch to implement tcp-connection-limit from Jim Hague (Sinodun). This limits the number of simultaneous TCP client connections from a nominated netblock. - make depend, yacc, lex, doc, headers. And log the limit exceeded message only on high verbosity, so as to not spam the logs when it is busy.
6 August 2018: Wouter - Fix for #4136: Fix to unconditionally call destroy in daemon.c.
3 August 2018: George - Expose if a query (or a subquery) was ratelimited (not src IP ratelimiting) to libunbound under 'ub\_result.was\_ratelimited'. This also introduces a change to 'ub\_event\_callback\_type' in libunbound/unbound-event.h. - Tidy pylib tests.
3 August 2018: Wouter - Revert previous change for #4136: because it introduces build problems. - New fix for #4136: This one ignores lex without without yylex\_destroy.
1 August 2018: Wouter - Fix to remove systemd sockaddr function check, that is not always present. Make socket activation more lenient. But not different when socket activation is not used. - iana port list update.
31 July 2018: Wouter - Patches from Jim Hague (Sinodun) for EDNS KeepAlive. - Sort out test runs when the build directory isn't the project root directory. - Add config tcp-idle-timeout (default 30s).
