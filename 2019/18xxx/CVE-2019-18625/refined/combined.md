Package        : suricata
Version        : 2.0.7-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18625 CVE-2019-18792

Two vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in the stream-tcp code
of the intrusion detection and prevention tool Suricata.

CVE-2019-18625

    It was possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by faking a
    closed TCP session using an evil server. After the TCP SYN packet, it
    was possible to inject a RST ACK and a FIN ACK packet with a bad TCP
    Timestamp option. The client would have ignored the RST ACK and the
    FIN ACK packets because of the bad TCP Timestamp option.

CVE-2019-18792

    It was possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by
    overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet. The fake FIN packet
    had to be injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we wanted to
    bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) would have been
    ignored by Suricata because it would have overlapped the FIN packet
    (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets). The
    client would have ignored the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag
    would not have been set.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.7-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your suricata packages.

**Description**

It is possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by faking a closed TCP session using an evil server.
After the TCP SYN packet, it's possible to inject a RST ACK and a FIN ACK packet with an old TCP Timestamp option.
The client will ignore the RST ACK and the FIN ACK packets because of the old TCP Timestamp option.
Both linux and windows client are ignoring the injected packets.

```

Client    ->  [SYN] [Seq=0 Ack=0]                                     ->  Evil Server     # Legit TCP handshake
Client    <-  [RST, ACK] [Seq=0 Ack=1] [old TCP Timestamp option]     <-  Evil Server     # Injected packet
Client    <-  [FIN, ACK] [Seq=0 Ack=1] [old TCP Timestamp option]     <-  Evil Server     # Injected packet
Client    <-  [SYN, ACK] [Seq=0 Ack=1]                                <-  Evil Server     # Legit TCP handshake
Client    <-  [ACK] [Seq=1 Ack=1]                                     <-  Evil Server     # Legit TCP handshake
Client    ===============  Data evasion        =================          Evil Server

```

This evasion technique is referenced as CVE-2019-18625.

stream: fix SYN\_SENT RST/FIN injection

```
RST injection during the SYN_SENT state could trick Suricata into marking
a session as CLOSED. The way this was done is: using invalid TSECR value
in RST+ACK packet. The ACK was needed to force Linux into considering the
TSECR value and compare it to the TSVAL from the SYN packet.

The second works only against Windows. The client would not use a TSVAL
but the RST packet would. Windows will reject this, but Suricata considered
the RST valid and triggered the CLOSED logic.

This patch addresses both. When the SYN packet used timestamp support
the timestamp of incoming packet is validated. Otherwise, packet responding
should not have a timestamp.

stream: fix SYN\_SENT RST/FIN injection

```
RST injection during the SYN_SENT state could trick Suricata into marking
a session as CLOSED. The way this was done is: using invalid TSECR value
in RST+ACK packet. The ACK was needed to force Linux into considering the
TSECR value and compare it to the TSVAL from the SYN packet.

The second works only against Windows. The client would not use a TSVAL
but the RST packet would. Windows will reject this, but Suricata considered
the RST valid and triggered the CLOSED logic.

This patch addresses both. When the SYN packet used timestamp support
the timestamp of incoming packet is validated. Otherwise, packet responding
should not have a timestamp.
