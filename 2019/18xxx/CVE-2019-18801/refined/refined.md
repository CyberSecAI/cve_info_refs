  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The encoder in Envoyâ€™s HTTP/1 codec assumes that the `:method` header field is less than 4KB when allocating buffers. The HTTP/2 codec does not impose a limit on this header's size. Thus, a large `:method` header from an HTTP/2 client can cause a heap overflow in the buffer allocated for encoding when the upstream is HTTP/1.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow due to insufficient size check when handling HTTP/2 `:method` header for HTTP/1 upstream connections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a query-of-death scenario by corrupting the heap, and potentially bypass Envoy's access control mechanisms. Modification of requests from other users is also possible.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An untrusted remote client sends HTTP/2 requests with a `:method` header larger than 4KB when the upstream is HTTP/1."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to an Envoy proxy configured with an HTTP/1 upstream. No special privileges are required.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass path-based access control by shaping the heap, which includes sending one request to prime the heap with safe `:path` contents, and a second request to overflow the encoding buffer, modifying the path seen by the backend after the HTTP connection manager has already processed it.\n\nThe range of the overflow is limited to printable ASCII characters, and the size is limited to roughly the length of the path and method header fields, which is bounded to 64KB by default on Envoy."
