{
  "CVE-2019-18422": {
    "root_cause": "When an exception occurs on an ARM system without changing processor level, some interrupts are unconditionally enabled during exception entry. This effectively unmasks interrupts that were previously masked.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unconditional interrupt enabling during exception handling on ARM systems."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest could cause critical Xen code to run with interrupts erroneously enabled, potentially leading to data corruption, denial of service, or privilege escalation. A precise attack technique has not been identified.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious guest triggering an exception while interrupts are masked, resulting in their unintended unmasking.",
       "Possibly exploitable by unprivileged userspace attacker on some platforms."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code within a Xen guest. On some platforms, this vulnerability might be triggered by unprivileged userspace attackers."
  }
