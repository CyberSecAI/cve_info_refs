  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-18888",
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Symfony 2.8.0 through 2.8.50, 3.4.0 through 3.4.34, 4.2.0 through 4.2.11, and 4.3.0 through 4.3.7. If an application passes unvalidated user input as the file for which MIME type validation should occur, then arbitrary arguments are passed to the underlying file command. This is related to symfony/http-foundation (and symfony/mime in 4.3.x).",
    "affected_versions": [
      ">= 2.0.0, < 2.8.52",
      ">= 3.0.0, < 3.4.35",

      "3.4.35",
      "4.2.12",
      "4.3.8"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The `FileBinaryMimeTypeGuesser` in Symfony's `http-foundation` and `mime` components did not properly escape file paths before using them in a command execution. This allowed for argument injection vulnerabilities when user-controlled file paths were used for MIME type validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-20",
      "CWE-88"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary arguments into the underlying `file` command used for MIME type detection, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, such as reading arbitrary files on the server or other forms of command injection.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted file path with malicious arguments through an application that uses the affected Symfony components for MIME type validation.",
