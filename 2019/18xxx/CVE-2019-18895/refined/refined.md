  "cve": "CVE-2019-18895",
  "description": "ScanGuard through 2019-11-12 on Windows has Insecure Permissions for the installation directory, leading to privilege escalation via a Trojan horse executable file. The product sets weak access control restrictions, as permissions are set to Full Control for Everyone group. This can allow low integrity malware the ability to replace ScanGuard executables.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure permissions on the installation directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Permissions",
      "Weak access control restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "Code execution, escalation of privileges, and information disclosure.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation via low integrity malware",
      "Non-privileged user replacing a legitimate executable"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to write to the ScanGuard installation directory. This could be achieved by either a non-privileged user or by low integrity malware."
