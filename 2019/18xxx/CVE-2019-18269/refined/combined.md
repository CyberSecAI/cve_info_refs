Vulnerabilities in Omron PLCs

Omron Corporation

Release date: December 6, 2019

Last modified on January 10, 2023

Thank you for your use of Omron’s programmable controllers (PLC).

An external institution pointed out vulnerabilities in our PLCs: multiple vulnerabilities

in the FINS protocol and one in the FTP function. We would kindly ask you to read the

details below and take countermeasures to avoid risks.

1． Affected Equipment

-  All versions of CS series CPU Units

-  All versions of CJ series CPU Units

-  All versions of NJ series CPU Units (except CVE-2019-18269)

-  All versions of NX series CPU Units (except CVE-2019-18269)

2． Details of Vulnerabilities

2.1 Multiple vulnerabilities in the FINS communication protocol

FINS communication packet between a controller and a PLC may be monitored and

it  may  invite  replay  attack  using  commands  for  the  PLC.  Vulnerabilities  are

described in the following.

・Authentication Bypass by Spoofing

CWE: CWE-290 Authentication Bypass by Spoofing

CVE: CVE-2019-18259

CVSSv3: 5.6（Medium) CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Omron’s CS, CJ, NJ and NX series PLCs have vulnerability that an ID-theft may be

authenticated.

・Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay

CWE: CWE-294 Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay

CVE: CVE-2019-13533

CVSSv3: 8.1（High）CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

Omron’s CS, CJ, NJ and NX series PLCs have vulnerability that some

functions may be executed unintentionally.

・Vulnerability in password on UM of FINS

CWE-412 Unrestricted Externally Accessible Lock

CVE：CVE-2019-18269

CVSSv3: 8.6（High）CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H

Omron’s  CS  and  CJ  series  PLCs  have  unrestricted  externally  accessible  lock

vulnerability.

2.2 Vulnerability in the FTP function

・FTP password authentication has a risk of brute-force attack

CWE: CWE-307 Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts

CVE:  CVE-2019-18261

CVSSv3: 6.5（Medium) CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Omron’s CS, CJ, NJ and NX series PLCs have vulnerability regarding restriction for

over trials of authentication.

3． Countermeasures

To avoid the risk of attacks from windows of those vulnerabilities, we have asked our

customers to adopt the following countermeasures by themselves:

1)  Antivirus protection

2)  Data input/output protection

3)  Data backup

4)  Protection against computer virus for Omron products and installed software 5)

Adequate prevention against illegal access to Omron products

For instance, a firewall to protect devices from an external network, network access

restriction  by  VPN,

filtering  a  well-known  communication  port

(FINS

communication port is 9600, FTP communication port is 21, default) in the network

side, using Omron’s PLC function such as packet filtering / disabling unused protocol

or other proper security measures are recommended.

4． Acknowledgments

Japing You (XDU) and n0b0dy reported us via CISA the multiple vulnerabilities in

the FINS communication protocol vulnerabilities.

n0b0dy reported us via CISA the vulnerability in the FTP function.

Pawan Sable and Dr. Faruk Kazi from COE-CNDS Lab, VJTI Mumbai, India in the

Security Advisory (SA) reported us via CERT-In and JPCERT/CC the vulnerability

in the FINS protocol in NX1P2.

Many thanks to all reporters.

Omron will keep improving product security. We appreciate your continuous loyalty for

our products.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Omron recommends the following mitigation measures:

* Filter FINS port: Protect access to Omron’s PLC with a firewall and blocking unnecessary remote access to FINS port (default: 9600).
* Filter IP addresses: Protect access to Omron’s PLC with a firewall and filtering devices connected to the PLC by IP address.

For more information provided by Omron on these vulnerabilities refer to [Vulnerabilities in Omron CS and CJ series CPU PLCs](https://gcc01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.omron-cxone.com%2Fsecurity%2F2019-12-06_PLC_EN.pdf&data=02%7C01%7Ckent.norris%40inl.gov%7C20bf150382654ea6bed508d77a33e9d1%7C4cf464b7869a42368da2a98566485554%7C0%7C1%7C637112235716101466&sdata=HF291pOMe65LwSvq4DynQqT%2FX7Sw%2BT92JGwRsXmC7WU%3D&reserved=0).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
