```
- Root cause of vulnerability: Side channel attack on ECDSA.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:  A side-channel vulnerability exists in the implementation of deterministic ECDSA within the mbedtls library.
- Impact of exploitation: Attackers can potentially extract sensitive information related to the ECDSA private key.
- Attack vectors: Side-channel attack.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: Attacker needs to be in a position to perform side-channel analysis on the system executing mbedtls.
