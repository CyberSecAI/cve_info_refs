Knowledge of the crash event and the TeamViewer ID as well as either possession of the pre-crash connection password or local authenticated access to the machine would have allowed to establish a remote connection by reusing the not properly deleted connection password.

### [CVE-2021-35005](/cve/CVE-2021-35005/ "CVE-2021-35005 security vulnerability details")

This vulnerability allows local attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of TeamViewer. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the TeamViewer service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated array. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM. Was ZDI-CAN-13818.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of TeamViewer 15.16.8.0. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of TVS files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory corruption condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-13697.

### [CVE-2020-13699](/cve/CVE-2020-13699/ "CVE-2020-13699 security vulnerability details")

 Public exploit

TeamViewer Desktop for Windows before 15.8.3 does not properly quote its custom URI handlers. A malicious website could launch TeamViewer with arbitrary parameters, as demonstrated by a teamviewer10: --play URL. An attacker could force a victim to send an NTLM authentication request and either relay the request or capture the hash for offline password cracking. This affects teamviewer10, teamviewer8, teamviewerapi, tvchat1, tvcontrol1, tvfiletransfer1, tvjoinv8, tvpresent1, tvsendfile1, tvsqcustomer1, tvsqsupport1, tvvideocall1, and tvvpn1. The issue is fixed in 8.0.258861, 9.0.258860, 10.0.258873, 11.0.258870, 12.0.258869, 13.2.36220, 14.2.56676, 14.7.48350, and 15.8.3.

An issue was discovered in the Chat functionality of the TeamViewer desktop application 14.3.4730 on Windows. (The vendor states that it was later fixed.) Upon login, every communication is saved within Windows main memory. When a user logs out or deletes conversation history (but does not exit the application), this data is not wiped from main memory, and therefore could be read by a local user with the same or greater privileges.

### [CVE-2019-18988](/cve/CVE-2019-18988/ "CVE-2019-18988 security vulnerability details")

 Known exploited

TeamViewer Desktop through 14.7.1965 allows a bypass of remote-login access control because the same key is used for different customers' installations. It used a shared AES key for all installations since at least as far back as v7.0.43148, and used it for at least OptionsPasswordAES in the current version of the product. If an attacker were to know this key, they could decrypt protect information stored in the registry or configuration files of TeamViewer. With versions before v9.x , this allowed for attackers to decrypt the Unattended Access password to the system (which allows for remote login to the system as well as headless file browsing). The latest version still uses the same key for OptionPasswordAES but appears to have changed how the Unattended Access password is stored. While in most cases an attacker requires an existing session on a system, if the registry/configuration keys were stored off of the machine (such as in a file share or online), an attacker could then decrypt the required password to login to the system.

### [CVE-2019-18196](/cve/CVE-2019-18196/ "CVE-2019-18196 security vulnerability details")

A DLL side loading vulnerability in the Windows Service in TeamViewer versions up to 11.0.133222 (fixed in 11.0.214397), 12.0.181268 (fixed in 12.0.214399), 13.2.36215 (fixed in 13.2.36216), and 14.6.4835 (fixed in 14.7.1965) on Windows could allow an attacker to perform code execution on a target system via a service restart where the DLL was previously installed with administrative privileges. Exploitation requires that an attacker be able to create a new file in the TeamViewer application directory; directory permissions restrict that by default.

### [CVE-2019-11769](/cve/CVE-2019-11769/ "CVE-2019-11769 security vulnerability details")

An issue was discovered in TeamViewer 14.2.2558. Updating the product as a non-administrative user requires entering administrative credentials into the GUI. Subsequently, these credentials are processed in Teamviewer.exe, which allows any application running in the same non-administrative user context to intercept them in cleartext within process memory. By using this technique, a local attacker is able to obtain administrative credentials in order to elevate privileges. This vulnerability can be exploited by injecting code into Teamviewer.exe which intercepts calls to GetWindowTextW and logs the processed credentials.

TeamViewer through 13.1.1548 stores a password in Unicode format within TeamViewer.exe process memory between "[00 88] and "[00 00 00]" delimiters, which might make it easier for attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging an unattended workstation on which TeamViewer has disconnected but remains running.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Omron recommends users update to CX-Supervisor Version 3.51 (9). The following link contains Omron’s explanation for the changes and instructions to obtain the update: [CX-Supervisor Version 3.51 (9) update](https://www.myomron.com/index.php?action=kb&article=1713).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
