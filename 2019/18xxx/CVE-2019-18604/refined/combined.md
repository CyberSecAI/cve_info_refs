Version        : 2018.20181218.49446-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18604
Debian Bug     : 1036891

It was discovered that the patch to fix CVE-2023-32700 in texlive-bin, released
as DLA-3427-1, was incomplete and caused an error when running the lualatex
command.

The following security vulnerability has been addressed as well.

CVE-2019-18604

     A flaw was found in axohelp in axodraw2. The sprintf function is
     mishandled which may cause a stack overflow error.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2018.20181218.49446-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your texlive-bin packages.

For the detailed security status of texlive-bin please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/texlive-bin>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

|  |  | At the moment that this document was updated (January 2018), axodraw2 |
|  |  | was part of both the main \TeX{} distributions, TeXLive and MiKTeX. |
|  |  | The easiest way to install axodraw2 is therefore from the package |
|  |  | manager of your \TeX{} distribution. (There is one complication |
|  |  | concerning the \program{axohelp} program --- see below.) |

|  |  |  |
|  |  | You can also obtain axodraw2 from CTAN at |

|  |  | the instructions in Sec.\ \ref{sec:manual.install} below. |

|  |  | \paragraph{\program{axohelp} in TeXLive} |
|  |  | In TeXLive 2017, a binary executable for the \program{axohelp} was not |
|  |  | provided, even though the rest of the axodraw2 package was provided. |
|  |  | Thus you could use axodraw2 with the \program{latex} but not with |
|  |  | \program{pdflatex} unless you compiled and installed the program |
|  |  | \program{axohelp} yourself following the instructions below. This is |
|  |  | planned to be changed in TeXLive 2018, when \program{axohelp} should |
|  |  | be provided as part of the distribution when the package axodraw2 is |
|  |  | installed from the package manager. |
|  |  | In TeXLive 2018 and later, a binary executable for the |
|  |  | \program{axohelp} is provided, as part of the \program{axodraw2} |
|  |  | package. So \program{axohelp} is available provided that the |
|  |  | \program{axodraw2} package is installed.. |

|  |  | or \program{xelatex}., then you need to install the \program{axohelp} |
|  |  | program. |

|  |  | \program{lualatex}, or \program{xelatex}, then you need to install the |
|  |  | \program{axohelp} program. \emph{(It is useful to reiterate here that |
|  |  | the standard distributions of \TeX{} currently supply the |
|  |  | \program{axohelp} program. So the steps described here are only |
|  |  | necessary if for some reason you wish to do a manual installation. |
|  |  | One possible reason is to use a recent update of \program{axohelp}, |
|  |  | since TeXLive normally only supplies updated versions of binary |
|  |  | executable files with the initial release of one of TeXLive's yearly |
|  |  | versions.)} |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | To install \program{axohelp} manually, you will first need to compile |
|  |  | the program by a C compiler. Under a Unix-like operating system |
|  |  | (linux or macOS) an appropriate shell command is |
|  |  | \begin{verbatim} |
|  |  | cc -o axohelp -O3 axohelp.c -lm |
|  |  | \end{verbatim} |
|  |  | (Note that this is a C compiler, \emph{not} a C++ compiler.) Most linux |
|  |  | systems have the program \program{cc} already installed. This also applies to |
|  |  | OS-X at versions below 10.7. But on OS-X version 10.7 and higher, you |
|  |  | macOS(OS-X) at versions below 10.7. But on macOS version 10.7 and higher, you |
|  |  | will need to install a compiler, which can be done by installing XCode |
|  |  | and the associated command-line utilities. If you have the GNU |
|  |  | compilers installed, you might need to use the command \program{gcc} |
|  |  | instead of \program{cc}. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | For Microsoft Windows, if you do not have a C compiler available, you |
|  |  | can use the Windows binary \file{axohelp.exe} we have provided. It |
|  |  | was compiled on Windows 10, and should work with at least that version |
|  |  | of Windows. |
|  |  | For Microsoft Windows, you will need to have installed a C compiler, |
|  |  | and use it to compile \file{axohelp.c}. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In any case once you have the executable (named \program{axohelp} on |
|  |  | unix-like systems, or \program{axohelp.exe} on a Microsoft system), put |
|  |  | it in a directory where it will be found when you run programs from |
|  |  | the command line. |
|  |  | Once you have the executable (named \program{axohelp} on Unix-like |
|  |  | systems, or \program{axohelp.exe} on a Microsoft system), put it in a |
|  |  | directory where it will be found when you run programs from the |
|  |  | command line. |
