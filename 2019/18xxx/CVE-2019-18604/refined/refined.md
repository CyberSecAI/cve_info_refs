Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-18604:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `axohelp` utility, specifically in how the `sprintf` function is used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stack Overflow:** The mishandling of the `sprintf` function can lead to a stack overflow. This occurs when the function attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer size on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Stack Overflow:** A stack overflow can overwrite important data on the stack, including return addresses. This can result in arbitrary code execution if the attacker carefully crafts the input to overwrite a return address with the address of malicious code, denial of service due to program crash, or other unpredictable program behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file by the `axohelp` program. The specific method by which the input is processed is not detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to provide a malicious input file to the `axohelp` program. This likely implies that the attacker would need to somehow get the vulnerable program to process the input, either through local access or by exploiting a server that uses the `axohelp` utility. The attacker doesn't need a privileged position to exploit this, however a successful exploit may lead to a compromise of a system.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information is more detailed than the standard CVE description, which simply states that `sprintf` is mishandled.
- The provided commit log indicates the fix involves correcting issues in how  `sprintf` is used.
- The vulnerability is located in the `axohelp.c` file within the `axodraw2-src` directory.
- There are test cases included (`axohelp-big.test` and `axohelp.test`) for the program, implying the fixes were tested.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 1.3 of `axohelp`.
