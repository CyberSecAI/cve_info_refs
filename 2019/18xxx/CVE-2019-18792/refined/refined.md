Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18792:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Suricata's improper handling of TCP packets, specifically when a fake FIN packet with the same sequence and acknowledgement numbers as a subsequent PUSH ACK packet is injected. Suricata would incorrectly ignore the legitimate PUSH ACK packet because of this overlap.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **TCP Stream Reassembly Bypass**: Suricata fails to correctly process overlapping TCP segments when a crafted FIN packet is injected, leading to the legitimate data-carrying packet being ignored.
- **Evasion of TCP-based signatures**: The vulnerability allows for the evasion of any TCP-based signature rules, as the malicious payload can be sent without Suricata detecting it.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Signature Bypass:** An attacker can bypass Suricata's detection rules by injecting a specially crafted TCP stream, allowing malicious traffic to pass undetected.
- **Compromised Network Security:**  The inability of Suricata to detect malicious data payloads due to this evasion can lead to successful exploitation of systems protected by Suricata.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based and involves the injection of crafted TCP packets into a network stream. Specifically:
  1. A legitimate TCP handshake is established between a client and a server controlled by the attacker.
  2. The attacker's server injects a fake FIN packet with a sequence and ack number matching that of the next legitimate packet.
  3. The legitimate data carrying PUSH ACK packet is then sent, which is ignored by Suricata.
  4. The client still processes the legitimate packet (as they ignore the injected FIN packet).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) or server control:** The attacker needs to be in a position to inject arbitrary TCP packets into the data stream. This can be achieved by controlling the server or by performing a MITM attack.
- **Knowledge of TCP:** The attacker must have a sufficient understanding of the TCP protocol to craft packets with the correct sequence and acknowledgement numbers.
- The attacker must have the ability to send network traffic to the targeted client.

**Additional Details:**
- This issue was addressed by modifying the stream-tcp.c to reject packets with broken ACK fields (non-zero ACK field without the ACK flag set)
- The issue was reported by Nicolas Adba.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Suricata versions 4.1.6 and 5.0.1.
- The fix involved adding a check for packets with a non-zero ACK field but without the ACK flag set, and dropping these packets.
