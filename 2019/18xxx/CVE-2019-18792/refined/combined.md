### TCP evasion technique by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake packet (4.1.x)

Added by [Victor Julien](/users/4) [about 5 years](/projects/suricata/activity?from=2019-12-10 "12/10/2019 04:20 PM") ago.

Affected Versions:[4.1.5](/versions/133 "09/24/2019")Label:CVE:[2019-18792](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18792)Git IDs:

Severity:Disclosure Date:

---

**Description**

It's possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet.

The fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we want to bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignored by suricata because it overlaps the FIN packet (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets).
The client will ignore the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag is not set.
Both linux and windows client are ignoring the injected packet.

```

Client    ===============  Legit TCP handshake  =================     Evil Server
Client    <-  [FIN] [Seq=80 Ack=100] XXXXXXX                      <-  Evil Server     # injected packet with fake data (ignored by the client)
Client    <-  [PUSH, ACK] [Seq=80 Ack=100] MALWARE                <-  Evil Server     # Legit data (ignored by suricata)

```

This evasion technique is referenced as CVE-2019-18792.

You can find attached :
 - test.rule : A tcp rule that detects the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST
 - without\_evasion.pcap : A web server which sends the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST to a client without any evasion technique
 - with\_evasion\_windows.pcap : A web server which sends the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST to a windows 10 client with this evasion technique
 - with\_evasion\_linux.pcap : A web server which sends the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST to a linux client (tested with kernel 5.2.0) with this evasion technique

Package        : suricata
Version        : 2.0.7-2+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18625 CVE-2019-18792

Two vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in the stream-tcp code
of the intrusion detection and prevention tool Suricata.

CVE-2019-18625

    It was possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by faking a
    closed TCP session using an evil server. After the TCP SYN packet, it
    was possible to inject a RST ACK and a FIN ACK packet with a bad TCP
    Timestamp option. The client would have ignored the RST ACK and the
    FIN ACK packets because of the bad TCP Timestamp option.

CVE-2019-18792

    It was possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by
    overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet. The fake FIN packet
    had to be injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we wanted to
    bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) would have been
    ignored by Suricata because it would have overlapped the FIN packet
    (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets). The
    client would have ignored the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag
    would not have been set.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.7-2+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your suricata packages.

Fix evasion posibility by rejecting packets with a broken ACK field.
These packets have a non-0 ACK field, but do not have a ACK flag set.

Fix evasion posibility by rejecting packets with a broken ACK field.
These packets have a non-0 ACK field, but do not have a ACK flag set.

Bug [#3324](https://github.com/OISF/suricata/pull/3324).

### TCP evasion technique by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake packet

Added by [Nicolas Adba](/users/5012) [about 5 years](/projects/suricata/activity?from=2019-11-06 "11/06/2019 10:12 PM") ago.

Affected Versions:[5.0.0](/versions/129 "10/15/2019")Label:CVE:[2019-18792](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18792)Git IDs:

fa692df37a796c3330c81988d15ef1a219afc006

Severity:Disclosure Date:

---

**Description**

It's possible to bypass/evade any tcp based signature by overlapping a TCP segment with a fake FIN packet.

The fake FIN packet is injected just before the PUSH ACK packet we want to bypass. The PUSH ACK packet (containing the data) will be ignored by suricata because it overlaps the FIN packet (the sequence and ack number are identical in the two packets).
The client will ignore the fake FIN packet because the ACK flag is not set.
Both linux and windows client are ignoring the injected packet.

```

Client    ===============  Legit TCP handshake  =================     Evil Server
Client    <-  [FIN] [Seq=80 Ack=100] XXXXXXX                      <-  Evil Server     # injected packet with fake data (ignored by the client)
Client    <-  [PUSH, ACK] [Seq=80 Ack=100] MALWARE                <-  Evil Server     # Legit data (ignored by suricata)

```

This evasion technique is referenced as CVE-2019-18792.

You can find attached :
 - test.rule : A tcp rule that detects the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST
 - without\_evasion.pcap : A web server which sends the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST to a client without any evasion technique
 - with\_evasion\_windows.pcap : A web server which sends the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST to a windows 10 client with this evasion technique
 - with\_evasion\_linux.pcap : A web server which sends the string THIS\_IS\_A\_TEST to a linux client (tested with kernel 5.2.0) with this evasion technique
