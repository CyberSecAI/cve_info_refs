| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156329#c0)  Robert Frohl   2019-11-08 15:55:41 UTC  ``` Problem Description:   Due to improper input validation Squid is vulnerable to security  bypass attacks. Attacker can gain access to restricted HTTP  servers.   Due to incorrect input validation Squid is vulnerable to a buffer  overflow which can result in Denial of Service to all clients  using the proxy.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   Any remote client may access resources which should be restricted  and not available to them. Such as those protected behind client  IP ACLs. Attacker could also gain access to manager services when  Via header is turned off.   Any remote client can perform a Denial of Service on all other  clients using the proxy.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   These bugs are fixed by Squid version 4.9.   In addition, a patch addressing this problem for stable releases  can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 4:  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-fbbdf75efd7a5cc244b4886a9d42ea458c5a3a73.patch>>   If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:  Use the command 'squid -v' to view version and build details of your proxy;   All Squid 2.x have not been checked.  All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.  All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 are vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Workaround:   Access to manager services can be prevented by enabling the Via  header:    via on   There are no reliable workarounds to prevent access to restricted  upstream servers.   There are no workarounds for the Denial of Service issue.   <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_8.txt> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12523> <http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18676> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156329#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-08 17:00:25 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1156329) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/746661> Factory / squid ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156329#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-14 20:15:26 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2975-1: An update that fixes 12 vulnerabilities is now available.

* [squid3](/security/cves?package=squid3) - Web proxy cache server

## Details

Jeriko One and Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly

handled certain URN requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to bypass access checks and access restricted servers. This issue was

only addressed in Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-12523](/security/CVE-2019-12523))

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handed URN responses. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-12526](/security/CVE-2019-12526))

Alex Rousskov discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain strings. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Squid to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.04.

([CVE-2019-12854](/security/CVE-2019-12854))

Jeriko One and Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly

handled certain input. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu

19.10. ([CVE-2019-18676](/security/CVE-2019-18676))

Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain

messages. This issue could result in traffic being redirected to origins

it should not be delivered to. ([CVE-2019-18677](/security/CVE-2019-18677))

Régis Leroy discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain HTTP

request headers. A remote attacker could use this to smuggle HTTP requests

and corrupt caches with arbitrary content. ([CVE-2019-18678](/security/CVE-2019-18678))

David Fifield discovered that Squid incorrectly handled HTTP Digest

Authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain

pointer contents and bypass ASLR protections. ([CVE-2019-18679](/security/CVE-2019-18679))

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-0b16cbdd0e
2019-12-05 01:09:44.879358
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc30
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [squid3](/security/cves?package=squid3) - Web proxy cache server

## Details

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handled caching certain

requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform

cache-injection attacks or gain access to reverse proxy features such as

ESI. ([CVE-2019-12520](/security/CVE-2019-12520))

Jeriko One and Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly

handled certain URN requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to bypass access checks. ([CVE-2019-12523](/security/CVE-2019-12523))

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handled URL decoding. A remote

attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass certain rule checks.

([CVE-2019-12524](/security/CVE-2019-12524))

Jeriko One and Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly

handled input validation. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-18676](/security/CVE-2019-18676))

Debian Bug     : 950802 931478 950925 912294

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities.
Due to incorrect input validation and URL request handling it was
possible to bypass access restrictions for restricted HTTP servers
and to cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

For the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2019:8
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2019:8
Date: November 05, 2019
Summary: Multiple issues in URI processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.x -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.8
Fixed in version: Squid 4.9

http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18676
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to improper input validation Squid is vulnerable to security
bypass attacks. Attacker can gain access to restricted HTTP
servers.
Due to incorrect input validation Squid is vulnerable to a buffer
overflow which can result in Denial of Service to all clients
using the proxy.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
Any remote client may access resources which should be restricted
and not available to them. Such as those protected behind client
IP ACLs. Attacker could also gain access to manager services when
Via header is turned off.
Any remote client can perform a Denial of Service on all other
clients using the proxy.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
These bugs are fixed by Squid version 4.9.
In addition, a patch addressing this problem for stable releases
can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 4:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
Use the command 'squid -v' to view version and build details of
your proxy;
All Squid 2.x have not been checked.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 are vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workaround:
Access to manager services can be prevented by enabling the Via
header:
via on
There are no reliable workarounds to prevent access to restricted
upstream servers.
There are no workarounds for the Denial of Service issue.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Contact details for the Squid project:
For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions
of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary
package vendor.
If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources
then the squid-users@squid-cache.org mailing list is your
primary support point. For subscription details see
http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html.
For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest release
the squid bugzilla database should be used
http://bugs.squid-cache.org/.
For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the
squid-bugs@squid-cache.org mailing list. It is a closed list
(though anyone can post) and security related bug reports are
treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-9538783033
2019-12-05 01:39:12.688383
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

### @yadij **[yadij](/yadij)** commented [Aug 12, 2018](#issue-349791002) • edited Loading

Initial replacement of URI/URL parse method internals with

SBuf and Tokenizer based parse.

For now this parsing only handles the scheme section of

URL. With this we add the missing check for alpha character

as first in the scheme name for unknown schemes and

prohibit URL without any scheme (previously accepted).

Also polishes the documentation, URN and asterisk-form

URI parsing.

Also, adds validation of URN NID portion characters to

ensure valid authority host names are generated for

THTTP lookup URLs.

Sorry, something went wrong.

I believe some new APIs should be adjusted. The rest is polishing.

I also suggest changing this PR title to `Update URI parser to use modern parsing APIs`.

BTW, have you considered completely dropping URN support?

Sorry, something went wrong.

| BTW, have you considered completely dropping URN support?  I have, and am undecided on that proposal. I know some places use urn:, but not necessarily via Squid. There are some things we might use it for internally (eg Store-ID standard IDs or direct pointers to cached variants) - but it may be beneficial to have a mapping of those in cache managers under http(s):// (making it more directly public, hmm). |

I have two serious concerns (one old one and one related to passing c-strings images of well-known schemes to the UriScheme constructor). IIRC, the rest is polishing.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### **[rousskov](/rousskov)** commented [Jul 8, 2019](#issuecomment-509396615)

| I have [considered removing URN support], and am undecided on that proposal. I know some places use urn:, but not necessarily via Squid. There are some things we might use it for internally (eg Store-ID standard IDs or direct pointers to cached variants) - but it may be beneficial to have a mapping of those in cache managers under http(s):// (making it more directly public, hmm).  Removing URN support does not mean we can never add that support back. Removing URN support simply means that we do not have the resources to maintain/improve that barely (if at all) used and very low-quality experimental code right now. Thus, future potential uses are pretty much irrelevant in this decision AFAICT.  The only important unknown here that may warrant keeping that code is the existence of a large set of current Squid users that are going to be inconvenienced (and that are actively supporting the Squid Project or are otherwise considered important for the Project). |

The first Raw() parameter names the thing you are printing. In this case, it is "path".

Also, we should not combine manual decorations with Raw decorations. As you probably know, I recommend removing single quotes because cache.log has enough delimiters to find the end of the path (which might contain single quotes itself). We should be relying on record separation mechanisms to separate records, not manual (and, hence, inconsistent and often insufficient) decorations.

Suggested change

|  | debugs(23, 3, "Split URI into proto='urn', nid='" << nid << "', path='" << Raw("tok",tok.remaining().rawContent(),tok.remaining().length()) << "'"); |
| --- | --- |
|  | debugs(23, 3, "Split URI into proto='urn', nid='" << nid << "', " << Raw("path",tok.remaining().rawContent(),tok.remaining().length())); |

If you insist on having those quotes, add the corresponding decoration method/logic to Raw via Raw::quote().

Sorry, something went wrong.

To simplify the Raw() call parameters, consider moving this debugs() lower, after setting various fields, including path. I do not insist on this change.

I found one bug and tried to respond to other recent code changes in hope to shorten the review cycles.

GitHub split my review into several separate change requests again, unfortunately, so please look around for more/isolated contemporary change requests. The `*end` bug should still be in *this* review though.

Please check whether minLevel() is needed here. Long Raw input will not be printed at lower debugging levels by default anyway, and it is probably a good idea to show short URIs for error messages.

With the requested change to use SBuf url variable these lines go from FromUrlXXX back to FromUrl and are no longer being touched by this PR. So the change to auto is now out of scope style polish. |
