The PR title is \"Update URI parser to use SBuf parsing APIs\". It involves replacing the internal URI/URL parsing methods with SBuf and Tokenizer based parsing. While the primary focus is on modernization, the fixes implemented here prevent issues like the buffer overflow vulnerability. Discussions within the PR also address URN handling, debugging output, and the use of `c_str()`. The commit ([`fbbdf75`](https://github.com/squid-cache/squid/commit/fbbdf75efd7a5cc244b4886a9d42ea458c5a3a73)) in particular introduces a fix relevant to this vulnerability."
