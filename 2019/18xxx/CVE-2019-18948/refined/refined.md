{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Malformed ARP packets can cause the VxlanSwFwd agent to crash, affecting software forwarding of VxLAN packets.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies within the VxLAN implementation in Arista's EOS software, specifically in how it handles certain malformed ARP packets.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation leads to a crash of the VxlanSwFwd agent. This can result in the loss of software forwarding of VxLAN packets, potentially causing traffic loss. However, existing ARP entries and hardware forwarding are not affected.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves sending specific malformed ARP packets to the affected device.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send malformed ARP packets to the vulnerable device. No specific authentication or privileged access is mentioned, implying an attacker on the same network might be able to trigger the vulnerability."
