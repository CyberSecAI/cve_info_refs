- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MsIo64.sys/MsIo32.sys driver in Viper RGB version 1.0 allows local users to read and write arbitrary memory locations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The driver does not properly restrict access to memory, enabling arbitrary memory read and write operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can gain `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` privileges by mapping `\Device\PhysicalMemory` into the calling process using `ZwOpenSection` and `ZwMapViewOfSection`. This allows for privilege escalation from low-integrity processes.
- **Attack vectors:** Local exploitation by any local user, including low-integrity processes.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable driver is installed.
