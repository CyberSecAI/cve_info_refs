Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is an arbitrary command injection vulnerability within the Cluster Server (VCS) component of Veritas InfoScale and related products. This vulnerability exists when the cluster is configured in non-secure mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization in the VCS component, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is present in multiple Veritas products that utilize the vulnerable VCS component, specifically when the product is configured to run in non-secure mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root (or administrator on Windows) on the affected system. This can lead to:
*   Loss of data managed by the product.
*   Loss of confidentiality of data managed by the product.
*   Loss of data on other systems where the product has stored credentials (as the attacker can access the decryption keys).
*   Installation of malware or crypto-mining software.
*   Complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The primary attack vector is remote, over a network, targeting systems running the affected Veritas products with a non-secure configuration for the VCS component. The specific port involved in the attack is 14150.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to reach port 14150 of the vulnerable system. No prior authentication is required.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **Veritas InfoScale and Related Products:**
    *   InfoScale Availability 7.4.1 and earlier on all platforms
    *   InfoScale Enterprise 7.4.1 and earlier on all platforms
    *   Cluster Server 6.2.1 and earlier for UNIX/Linux platforms
    *    Cluster Server 6.1 and earlier for Windows
    *   Storage Foundation HA 6.2.1 and earlier for UNIX/Linux platforms
    *   Storage Foundation HA 6.1 and earlier for Windows
*   **Veritas Flex Appliance:**
    *   Flex 1.2 and earlier
*   **Veritas Access and Access Appliance:**
    *   Access 7.4.2 and earlier only if port 14150 is manually unblocked.
    *   Access Appliance before 7.4.2.100.

**Mitigation:**
*   Enable secure mode for the cluster (if available).
*   Block port 14150 using a firewall to restrict access to authorized systems only.
* Disable the VCS Command Server (CmdServer) service (Flex Appliance)

**Remediation:**
Apply the provided patches for the affected products and versions.
