  /   [Security Alerts](/content/support/en_US/security.html)6. /  VTS19-006: Arbitrary Command Injection Vulnerability in Multiple Veritas Products

### Revisions

* 1.0: November 5, 2019, initial release

### Summary

There is an arbitrary command injection vulnerability that affects multiple Veritas products.  This vulnerability allows an unauthenicated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root.

The following Veritas products are known to be affected.  Click the link below to see the product specific security advisory for each product:

* [Veritas InfoScale and Related Products](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS19-003.html) (InfoScale Availability, InfoScale Enterprise, Cluster Server and Storage Foundation HA) when using VCS in non-secure mode
* [Flex Appliance](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS19-004.html)
* [Access and Access Appliance](https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS19-005.html)

No other Veritas products are believed to be affected by this issue.

This issue could result in:

* The loss of data managed by the product.
* The loss of confidentiality of data managed by the product.
* The loss of data on other systems for which the product has stored credentials. The product encrypts these credentials, however an attacker would have access to the keys needed to decrypt them.
* The installation of malware or crypto-mining software on the host system.

Other undesirable outcomes are also possible.

### Questions

If you have any questions about any information in this security advisory please contact [Veritas technical support](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html).

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities

### Revisions

* 1.0: November 5, 2019, Initial release
* 1.1: November 5, 2019: Corrected information related to Access Appliance blocking port 14150
* 1.2: November 6, 2019, Added CVE ID, corrected links to patches, clarified affected versions

### Summary

Arbitrary command injection vulnerability in the Veritas Access and Access Appliance.

| Issue | Description | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [1](#Issue1) | Arbitrary command injection vulnerability in the Cluster Server component of Veritas InfoScale included in Veritas Flex Appliance allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands as root. | Critical |

### Issues

#### Issue #1

There is an arbitrary command injection vulnerability in the Cluster Server (VCS) component of Veritas InfoScale that is included in Veritas Access and Access Appliance. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system or appliance as root, potentially allowing an attacker to take complete control of the system.

This issue could result in:

* The loss of data managed by the product.
* The loss of confidentiality of data managed by the product.
* The loss of data on other systems for which the product has stored credentials. The product encrypts these credentials, however an attacker would have access to the keys needed to decrypt them.
* The installation of malware or crypto-mining software on the host system.

Other undesirable outcomes are also possible.

CVE ID: [CVE-2019-18780](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18780)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.8 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

Affected Products

* Access 7.4.2 and earlier only if the customer has manually unblocked port 14150.  The default configuration blocks that port and is therefore secure.
* Access Appliance before 7.4.2.100.  Port 14150 is blocked starting with 7.4.2.100 and is therefore secure.

Mitigation

* This vulnerability can be mitigated by routing all traffic to the product through a firewall and having the firewall block all traffic on port 14150.

Remediation

* Patches are available for both [Access](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100046595) and [Access Appliance](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.100046596), 7.4.2 and 7.4.2.100.  Customers with earlier versions need to either deploy the mitigation described above or to upgrade to 7.4.2 or 7.4.2.100 and then apply the patch.

### Questions

If you have any questions about any information in this security advisory please contact [Veritas technical support](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html).

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.

Affected Products

* InfoScale Availability 7.4.1 and earlier on all platforms
* InfoScale Enterprise 7.4.1 and earlier on all platforms
* Cluster Server 6.2.1 and earlier for UNIX/Linux platforms
* Cluster Server 6.1 and earlier for Windows
* Storage Foundation HA 6.2.1 and earlier for UNIX/Linux platforms
* Storage Foundation HA 6.1 and earlier for Windows

Mitigations

* If your product is at a version for which no fix is available and you do not want to upgrade to the latest version, you can enable the secure mode for the existing clusters to mitigate the vulnerability. For details on how to do this, refer to the “Enabling and disabling secure mode for the cluster” section in the Cluster Server Administrator’s Guide of the applicable UNIX platform and product version or to the “Configuring the cluster using the Cluster Configuration Wizard” section in the Cluster Server Administrator’s Guide of the applicable product version for Windows.
* If it is not feasible to either upgrade the product or to enable the secure mode for existing clusters, you can mitigate the vulnerability by using a firewall to restrict access to port 14150 to only those systems that are used to administer the product.

### Questions

If you have any questions about any information in this security advisory please contact [Veritas technical support](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html).

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
