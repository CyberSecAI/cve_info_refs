Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18841

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a prototype pollution issue within the `Chartkick.js` library. The library doesn't properly sanitize user-provided input, specifically when parsing JSON objects for chart options. This allows an attacker to modify the `Object.prototype` by injecting a malicious payload within chart options (e.g., `{"__proto__": {"test": true}}`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core vulnerability is that the library allows modification of the `Object.prototype` through user-controlled input.
- Insecure JSON Parsing: Improper handling of JSON parsing results in the injection of malicious properties into the prototype chain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- By polluting the `Object.prototype`, an attacker can potentially affect the behavior of other JavaScript code within the same application that utilizes objects.
- This could lead to various unexpected outcomes, depending on how the polluted prototype is used, which could range from minor disruptions to more severe security issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious JSON options: An attacker can inject malicious properties by passing a crafted JSON string as chart options, either directly or via a URL.
- Malicious data source: If chart data is loaded from an external URL, a malicious server can inject a payload through JSON response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply crafted JSON data either directly to the `Chartkick.js` library as chart options or through a malicious data source used by the library.
- No specific privileges are required.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects `Chartkick.js` versions 3.1.0 to 3.1.3.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.2.0 of `Chartkick.js`.
- The advisory also mentions that a similar vulnerability was found in jQuery and was rated as a "minor vulnerability" since `Chartkick.js` is a client-side only library, its impact is considered to be limited.
-  The vulnerability is also present in the ruby gem `chartkick` versions < 3.3.0.

**CVSS Score:**

- CVSS v3: 7.3 High Severity.
- Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L

The provided content includes a commit diff that fixes the vulnerability. It seems the fix involved adding a check in the extend function for the `__proto__` key.
