- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Secure values could be exposed to users with the ‘View build runtime parameters and data’ permission.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information exposure of sensitive data
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users with specific permissions could gain access to secure values, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to have the 'View build runtime parameters and data' permission to be able to view these secure values.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be a user with the 'View build runtime parameters and data' permission within the TeamCity system.
