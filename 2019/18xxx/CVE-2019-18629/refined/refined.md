Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18629

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the IP Tables Custom Rules configuration. Specifically, a hacked clone dlm (likely referring to a device-level manager or similar component responsible for cloning or device duplication) can be exploited.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of the cloned data being applied to the IP tables custom rules.
- An attacker can inject malicious data or custom rules during the clone process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The main impact is the ability of an attacker to execute unwanted binaries on the affected Xerox devices. This means the attacker can gain control over the printer's operations, potentially leading to:
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Data exfiltration
    - Denial of Service attacks
    - Further system compromise

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a "hacked clone dlm". This suggests that the attacker needs to be able to perform a cloning procedure using a compromised source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify a clone image used for installing or configuring new devices.
- The attacker needs the ability to then apply this compromised clone to a target device.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the cloning process and the system structure.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided bulletin indicates that this vulnerability is considered "IMPORTANT".
- The fix involves removing the ability for an attacker to execute an unwanted binary during an exploited clone install.
- This vulnerability affects Xerox AltaLink B8045/B8055/B8065/B8075/B8090 and C8030/C8035/C8045/C8055/C8070 devices.
- The fix is included in SPAR Release 101.00X.099.28200 (R19-09) or later.
