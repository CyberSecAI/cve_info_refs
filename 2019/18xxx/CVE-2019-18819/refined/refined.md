The provided content details multiple crashes found in EximiousSoft Logo Designer 3.82. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Case #01:**

*   **Root cause:** Access violation due to writing to an invalid memory address.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Write Access Violation. The application attempts to write to memory at address `0x007e0003`, which is not a valid writable memory location.
*   **Impact:**  Application crash. The debugger output indicates an "EXPLOITABLE" classification, meaning that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:**  Opening a crafted `.eld` file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create/modify a `.eld` file and open it with the vulnerable software.

**Case #02:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap corruption.
*   **Vulnerability:** Heap corruption, likely due to an out-of-bounds write or double-free.
*   **Impact:** Application crash.  The debugger output indicates an "EXPLOITABLE" classification, meaning that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack vector:** Opening a crafted `.eld` file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create/modify a `.eld` file and open it with the vulnerable software.

**Case #03:**

*   **Root cause:** Access violation due to writing to an invalid memory address.
*   **Vulnerability:** Write Access Violation. The application attempts to write to memory at address `0x03270000`, which is not a valid writable memory location.
*   **Impact:** Application crash. The debugger output indicates an "EXPLOITABLE" classification, meaning that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack vector:** Opening a crafted `.eld` file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create/modify a `.eld` file and open it with the vulnerable software.

**Case #04:**

*   **Root cause:** Heap corruption.
*   **Vulnerability:** Heap corruption, likely due to an out-of-bounds write or double-free.
*   **Impact:** Application crash. The debugger output indicates an "EXPLOITABLE" classification, meaning that the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.
*  **Attack vector:** Opening a crafted `.eld` file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to create/modify a `.eld` file and open it with the vulnerable software.

**Summary of vulnerabilities:**

The blog post details 4 distinct crashes, two of which are due to write access violations to invalid memory, and the other two due to heap corruption. All 4 crashes are classified as "EXPLOITABLE" by the debugger, and all are triggered by opening a specially crafted `.eld` file. The root cause of each issue varies, but the impact is consistent: an exploitable crash.

This provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including stack traces, crash details, and a classification of exploitability.
