ICS Advisory
# ABB Relion 670 Series

Last RevisedNovember 26, 2019
Alert CodeICSA-19-330-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 10.0**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** ABB
* **Equipment:** Relion 670 Series
* **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to read and delete files on the device.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Relion 670 series, a protection and control device, are affected:

* Relion 670 series versions 1p1r26 and prior
* Relion 670 series versions 1.2.3.17 and prior
* Relion 670 series versions 2.0.0.10 and prior (RES670 2.0.0.4 and prior)
* Relion 670 series versions 2.1.0.1 and prior

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1 [IMPROPER LIMITATION OF A PATHNAME TO A RESTRICTED DIRECTORY ('PATH TRAVERSAL') CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)

An attacker could use specially crafted paths in a specific request to read or delete files from the device outside the intended directory.

[CVE-2019-18253](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-18253) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 10.0 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing, Energy
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Switzerland

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Kirill Nesterov of Kaspersky Lab reported this vulnerability to ABB.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

ABB recommends users update to the following or later versions at earliest convenience if IEC 61850 is used:

* Relion 670 series version 1p1r27
* Relion 670 series version 1.2.3.18
* Relion 670 series version 2.0.0.11 (RES670 2.0.0.5)
* Relion 670 series version 2.1.0.2

Updates can be ordered by email at: sa.t-supportline@se.abb.com

The only known workaround for this vulnerability is to disable IEC 61850 protocol when not in use. If this is not possible, ABB recommends having a proper security architecture that divides the system in different security zones, and revising the firewall configurations to limit the usage of MMS protocol to the relevant upper networks.

IEC 61850 MMS protocol uses Port 102/TCP.

ABB also recommends that these and other proper security practices and firewall configurations (including VPN) be implemented to help protect a process control network from attacks originating outside the network:

* Process control systems are physically protected from direct access by unauthorized personnel.
* Process control systems have no direct connections to the Internet.
* Process control systems are separated from other networks by means of a firewall system that has a minimal number of ports/services exposed.
* Process control systems should not be used for Internet surfing, instant messaging, or receiving e-mails.
* Portable computers and removable storage media should be carefully scanned for viruses before they are connected to a control system.
* If IEC 61850 protocol isn’t used, make sure it is disabled. This removes the vulnerability.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
