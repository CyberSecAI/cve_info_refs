- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the system's failure to properly handle specifically crafted message payloads received over a systems management communication channel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper handling of message payloads within the systems management component of Unisys ClearPath Forward Libra and ClearPath MCP Software Series.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to system faults and other unspecified impacts, including system unavailability, categorized as a high impact vulnerability. The CVSS vector indicates a high impact to integrity and availability (I:H/A:H).
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), requiring a specially crafted message payload sent over the systems management communication channel.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) and no user interaction (UI:N) is required. A successful attack requires the attacker to have the ability to craft and send a malicious message payload and is complex to exploit (AC:H). The system's scope is changed due to the vulnerability (S:C), indicating the vulnerable component can affect resources beyond its security scope.
