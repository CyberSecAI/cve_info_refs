{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The content type filter in Go-Camo can be bypassed by providing multiple values for the `Content-Type` header. The application only checks the first value, and does not validate subsequent values. For example, `Content-Type: image/png, text/html; charset=UTF-8` will bypass the filter, because `image/png` matches `image/*`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Content-Type validation bypass",
    "Improper input validation"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could trick Go-Camo into proxying arbitrary content, leading to XSS or phishing attacks. It could also allow arbitrary redirects.",
  "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted `Content-Type` header with multiple values, where the first value is an allowed content type (e.g., `image/*`), but subsequent values are not (e.g., `text/html`).",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the `Content-Type` header of the proxied resource. This could happen if the attacker can control the origin server or perform a man-in-the-middle attack.",
  "Additional Information": "Browsers prioritize the content type that fits the resource when provided with multiple content types in the `Content-Type` header. For example, a response with `Content-Type: image/svg+xml, text/html; charset=UTF-8` and HTML content would be rendered as HTML by browsers. The vulnerability was discovered by @dappelt and reported by GitLab. The fix involves properly validating all content types provided in the Content-Type header, which was implemented in version 2.1.1 of Go-Camo."
