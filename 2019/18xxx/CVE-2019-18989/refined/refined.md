- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that the vulnerable access points do not drop unencrypted packets with spoofed MAC addresses and instead route them to the network as though they were valid.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The main vulnerability is an authentication bypass. Specifically, it is a partial authentication bypass since a valid, authenticated client is required. The access point does not properly validate the source of network packets, allowing an attacker to inject unencrypted packets with spoofed MAC addresses into a WPA2-protected network.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary packets into a network without knowing the WPA2 preshared key. This allows them to send packets to the network, receive encrypted responses and eventually ascertain if injected packets successfully reached an active system. This could lead to further exploitation, such as opening ports in the router's NAT or sending malicious content to devices on the network.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is adjacent, requiring the attacker to be within the wireless range of the vulnerable access point.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be within the wireless range of a vulnerable access point and needs to be able to send unencrypted packets with spoofed MAC addresses. Importantly, there must be at least one other authenticated client already connected to the WPA2 network.
