Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Adaware Antivirus handles quarantined files and the restore process. The software uses SYSTEM privileges to quarantine and restore files. This creates an opportunity for privilege escalation using a combination of DLL hijacking and NTFS junctions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  The core weakness is that a low-privilege user can leverage the high privileges of the Adaware Antivirus service.
*   **DLL Hijacking:** The antivirus software is susceptible to DLL hijacking, loading a malicious DLL when restoring a file.
*   **NTFS Junctions:** The attacker uses NTFS junction points to redirect the restore operation to a protected system directory (C:\Windows\System32).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **System Privilege Gain:** A low-privilege user can achieve SYSTEM-level privileges, the highest level on Windows.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By planting a malicious DLL in a system directory, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows complete control over the compromised machine.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malware Creation:** The attacker must create a malicious DLL (e.g., using `msfvenom`) that will be detected by the antivirus.
*   **File Planting:** The malicious DLL needs to be planted on the filesystem where the attacker has write access.
*   **Antivirus Scan and Quarantine:** The attacker triggers a scan of the malicious file, causing it to be quarantined.
*   **NTFS Junction Creation:** The attacker creates an NTFS junction to redirect the restore path.
*   **File Restoration:** The attacker restores the file, placing it in the system directory.
*   **System Restart/Service Restart:** Triggering the execution of the malicious DLL requires either a system reboot or restarting a relevant service that will load the DLL
*   **DLL execution**: The planted malicious DLL is executed when the service/system restarts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the target system (even with low privileges).
*   **Write Access:**  The attacker needs write access to at least one location on the file system where a malicious DLL can be planted.
*   **Understanding of NTFS Junctions:** The attacker needs to be aware of NTFS junction points to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
