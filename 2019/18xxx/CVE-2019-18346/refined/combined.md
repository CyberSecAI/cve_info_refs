Original text at:
<https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18345-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability/>

At HackDefense, we were evaluating various calendaring solutions, and
during installation and configuration of DAViCal we discovered three
(severe) vulnerabilities. We reported these vulnerabilities to the
vendor. Unfortunately, the DAViCal project itself was not able to fix
these vulnerabilities. As DAViCal is an open source project we decided
to contribute patches for these vulnerabilities ourselves. DAViCal has
accepted our patches in the 1.1.9.1 release. If you use DAViCal as a
calendaring server, we recommend upgrading to version 1.1.9.1 immediately
to remediate the issues we’ve discovered.

All three vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management pages that
come with DAViCal. We have written three separate advisories to describe
the vulnerabilities:

    CVE-2019-18345 – (this advisory) Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
    CVE-2019-18346 – Cross-Site Request Forgery
    CVE-2019-18347 – Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

CVE Reference: CVE-2019-18345
CVSS score: 9.3
CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N

About DAViCal
=============

DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation of the
CalDAV protocol which is designed for storing calendaring resources on a
remote shared server. It can be used by various e‑mail and calendaring
clients to centrally store and share calendars.

It includes a web-based management application. It was in these pages
that we discovered this vulnerability.

Affected systems
================

DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 and prior

Overview
========

A reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in
multiple pages of the DAViCal CalDAV Server. This is possible because
the application echoes user supplied input without encoding.

POC URL:
<http://davical.host/admin.php?action=edit&t=">;><script>alert()</script>&id=1

Impact
======

If a user visits an attacker-supplied link, the attacker can view all
data the attacked user can view, as well as perform all actions in the
name of the user. If the user is administrator, the attacker can for
example change the password of the user to take over the account and
gain full access to the application.

Solution
========

Update to version 1.1.9.1

Technical solution details
==========================

XSS vulnerabilities are a problem with dynamically generated websites
that use user input. If user input is not correctly sanitized you could
very well end up with a user pushing some javascript to your frontend.

XSS isn’t a vulnerability that’s hard to grasp or circumvent but it’s
awfully easy to make a mistake like that. One thing you’ll hear over and
over again is never to trust user input. Always sanitize it when it
comes in and it’s best to still not trust it then. Characters like <, >
and " should never be rawly echoed to the frontend. The use cases for
echoing user input back to the frontend are endless. From a simple
"Greetings, $username" to editing personal user information with the
form having all the fields already filled in. So when someone has a
quote in their name, you shouldn’t echo the raw quote but &­quot;.

These days web frameworks handle a lot of sanitation for us. Laravel for
example uses simple brackets to echo variables to the user all these
variables are escaped first: {{ $username }}. Twig does something
similar by using a pipe like syntax: {{ $username | escape}}.

These days when developing your application you need to make sure you
sanitize everything you output to the user. But since DAViCal is an
established project it’s not doable to sift through the code to look for
functions that output text to the frontend. Another problem was that
DAViCal dynamically adds GET parameters to echoed urls. This is why I
chose to sanitize both incoming variables and their names. In the
DAViCal always.php I added a function that loops through the $_GET and
$_POST array recursively (as arrays can contain arrays and so forth) and
run the names and variables through htmlspecialchars() except for the
password field which of course should be able to have special characters
in them.

The reason you don’t do it this way in new applications is because now
if for some reason someone has another way of interacting with your
application (by API calls for example) you’d have to sanitize your input
on both sides. Moreover, APIs that pass JSON objects around for example,
don’t need to have script tags encoded as it means nothing to them and
JSON objects are encoded in a different way. In this case however,
DAViCal doesn’t have other entry points which you can use to insert data
in the database. So sanitizing all input once will suffice!

# About DAViCal

DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation
of the CalDAV protocol which is designed for storing calendaring
resources (in iCalendar format) on a remote shared server.

An increasing number of calendar clients support
the maintenance of shared remote calendars through CalDAV, including Mozilla Calendar
(Sunbird/Lightning), Evolution, Mulberry, Chandler, and various other closed-source products
such as Apple's iCal and iOS.

## Features

DAViCal:

* is [Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html) licensed under the [General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html).
* uses an SQL database for storage of event data
* supports backward-compatible access via WebDAV in read-only or read-write mode (not recommended)
* is committed to inter-operation with the widest possible CalDAV client software.

DAViCal supports basic delegation of read/write access among calendar users, multiple users or clients reading
and writing the same calendar entries over time, and scheduling of meetings with free/busy time displayed.

# Overview of Installation and Use

## Prerequisites

To install and use DAViCal you will need:

* a PostgreSQL database server
* a web server which can run PHP version 5

We use [Debian GNU/Linux](http://www.debian.org/) for this, but other people use various different
versions of Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OSX and even Microsoft Windows. We definitely do not recommend using Windows
for this unless you are completely hobbled by silly internal IT policies and have to do so.

## Getting and Installing DAViCal

Start by looking on the [DAViCal
Installation Page](installation.php) for instructions on places to download, and
detailed instructions as to what to do when you have it.

There is a lot of information on the wiki about [DAViCal configuration settings](http://wiki.davical.org/w/Configuration) but in most cases the configuration
will need very few of these settings.

## Using DAViCal

Read here about [how to configure various CalDAV Clients with DAViCal](clients.php). There is also
a page on the wiki which will sometimes have newer information.

## Getting Help

Specifically: help on DAViCal!

The *best* place to go for help on DAViCal is the [DAViCal Wiki](http://wiki.davical.org/w/Main_Page).

If you can't find your answer there, then the IRC channel #davical on irc.oftc.net is
a great next port of call. Many problems can be solved quickly with a short on-line chat.

Almost as good as the IRC channel is the [DAViCal General Mailing List](https://lists.sourceforge.net/mailman/listinfo/davical-general).

# Credits

The DAViCal CalDAV Server was conceived and written by [Andrew McMillan](http://andrew.mcmillan.net.nz/).

Many people have contributed to DAViCal, through providing translations of the interface, reporting bugs and
sending patches for things here and there. Some more notable contributors include:

* Maxime Delorme (CSS, LDAP, French translations)
* Andrew Ruthven (Various enhancements)
* Rob Ostenson (LDAP & Scheduling contributions)
* Leho Kraav (RSS feeds)

# Contributing to DAViCal

![DAViCal Logo](images/larger.png)As of Spring, 2014, DAViCal has transitioned to a [community support model](http://wiki.davical.org/w/Community_Support). We welcome contributions from interested people. You don't need to be able to write code - there are lots of
small tasks around the project that can be done.

Here are some things you could do that will help us to concentrate on making DAViCal better:

* Writing documentation
* Helping people on IRC or on the mailing list
* Translating the DAViCal interface to another language
* Managing the release process
* Reviewing and tidying the Wiki updates
* Writing and reviewing patches
* Designing future functionality
* Thinking of more interesting ways to contribute to DAViCal!

Can you think of more?

in another browser tab), the attacker can send arbitrary requests in the
name of the user to the application, including requests that result in a
state change.

For example, if an attacker includes the following HTML code on his/​her
site and an authenticated DAViCal administrator visits, a new
administrative account ​“hacker” (password also ​“hacker”) will
automatically be created in the background, giving the attacker full
access to the calendaring application:

Impact
======

In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker can change the e‑mail address
and password on a victim’s account, which results in a full account
takeover. If the compromised user has a privileged (administrator) role
within the application, then the attacker is also able to add a new
administrator user.

Solution
========

Update to version 1.1.9.1

Technical solution details
==========================

The most robust way to defend against CSRF attacks is to include a CSRF
token within relevant requests. The idea is that you assign a unique
token to a user’s session, this token can be regenerated whenever but
this usually happens when a new session is created (e.g.when the user
logs out and logs back in). This token is then required to be sent along
with the rest of the data you want to submit. Prior to performing the
action the called route is supposed to perform(let’s say you want to
update your user information) the application will check if a CSRF token
is present and whether it’s the right one. Onab.comce those two checks
pass the application will continue executing.

So the first task was to write a library that would generate a CSRF
token and attach it to the session. That’s all pretty basic, the only
thing I had to take into account is that the current requirement for
DAViCal is PHP 5.6.0 and up so I had to keep backwards compatibility in
mind. The token is generated by a random number generator (which one is
decided by the current PHP version) and then assigned to the user. Once
that was done the only thing left is to make sure every information
altering request verifies the CSRF token.

The modern way most web frameworks will handle this is by using
middleware. Let’s say you map a route to a function in your code,you can
then put a CSRF middleware in the middle of that ​‘mapping’. So let’s
say you’ve got the following mapping:

‘/​user/​information/​update’> updateUserInformation();

You’d then tell your framework to use a CSRF middleware which would
change the flow to:

‘/​user/​information/​update’> checkCSRF(); > updateUserInformation();

DAViCal however is quite an old project (the copyright states 2006 as
starting year) and we don’t have the luxury of a framework handling
these things for us. The easiest solution is to find every place a
POSTrequest is made and manually verifying the token at those places.
But I was keen to find out if there was a more central place I could put
the CSRF verifying function. As every developer will know, getting to
know and understand someone else’s code can be quite a tough one. I
found myself using xdebugquite a lot to figure out the flow of the
application until something quite obvious became apparent. There is a
PHP file in the project called ​‘always.php’ which always runs. This
file can be used to launch a function on every page load. This is where
I added a function to check the CSRF token on POST requests (which are
used in DAViCal to alter information).

The final act was adding the CSRF tokens to all the forms in DAViCal
which could be easily found by searching for </form>. Which concluded
the fix for the CSRF vulnerability in DAViCal.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

# CVE-2019-18347 Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DAViCal CalDAV Server

*From*: Rick Verdoes via Fulldisclosure <fulldisclosure () seclists org>

Original text at:
<https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18347-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability/>

At HackDefense, we were evaluating various calendaring solutions, and
during installation and configuration of DAViCal we discovered three
(severe) vulnerabilities. We reported these vulnerabilities to the
vendor. Unfortunately, the DAViCal project itself was not able to fix
these vulnerabilities. As DAViCal is an open source project we decided
to contribute patches for these vulnerabilities ourselves. DAViCal has
accepted our patches in the 1.1.9 release. If you use DAViCal as a
calendaring server, we recommend upgrading to version 1.1.9 immediately
to remediate the issues we’ve discovered.

All three vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management pages that
come with DAViCal. We have written three separate advisories to describe
the vulnerabilities:

    CVE-2019-18345 — Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
    CVE-2019-18346 — Cross-Site Request Forgery
    CVE-2019-18347 — (this advisory) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

CVE Reference: CVE-2019-18347
CVSS score: 9.9
CVSS vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

About DAViCal
=============

DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation of the
CalDAV protocol which is designed for storing calendaring resources on a
remote shared server. It can be used by various e‑mail and calendaring
clients to centrally store and share calendars.

It includes a web-based management application. It was in these pages
that we discovered this vulnerability.

Affected systems
================

DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 and prior

Overview
========

The application does not validate user input like email addresses,
usernames and display names. In addition, the web application does not
encode these user input when echoing them to in the web pages. An attack
with a low privileged account can exploit these issues to execute a
Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack.

POC URL: <http://davical.host/admin.php?action=edit&t=principal&id=1>

Place a XSS payload in the username or fullname field e.g.
<script>alert()</script>

Impact
======

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious JavaScript to an
unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the
script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because the
browser thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious
JavaScript can access session tokens (without the HttpOnly flag) or
other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that
site in the context of the victim.

If the user is administrator, the attacker can for example change the
password of the user to take over the account and gain full access to
the application.

In this case, because the Javascript is stored in the database and
included in pages others can open, it can be used by one user to attack
other users on the same system.

Combined with a CSRF attack (see CVE-2019 – 18346) it is possible to
attack users from the outside as well, if an authenticated DAViCal user
visits the attacker’s web site.

Solution
========

Update to version 1.1.9.1

Technical solution details
==========================

XSS vulnerabilities are a problem with dynamically generated websites
that use user input. If user input is not correctly sanitized you could
very well end up with a user pushing some javascript to your frontend.

XSS isn’t a vulnerability that’s hard to grasp or circumvent but it’s
awfully easy to make a mistake like that. One thing you’ll hear over and
over again is never to trust user input. Always sanitize it when it
comes in and it’s best to still not trust it then. Characters like <, >
and " should never be rawly echoed to the frontend. The use cases for
echoing user input back to the frontend are endless. From a simple
"Greetings, $username" to editing personal user information with the
form having all the fields already filled in. So when someone has a
quote in their name, you shouldn’t echo the raw quote but &­quot;.

These days web frameworks handle a lot of sanitation for us. Laravel for
example uses simple brackets to echo variables to the user all these
variables are escaped first: {{ $username }}. Twig does something
similar by using a pipe like syntax: {{ $username | escape}}.

These days when developing your application you need to make sure you
sanitize everything you output to the user. But since DAViCal is an
established project it’s not doable to sift through the code to look for
functions that output text to the frontend. Another problem was that
DAViCal dynamically adds GET parameters to echoed urls. This is why I
chose to sanitize both incoming variables and their names. In the
DAViCal always.php I added a function that loops through the $_GET and
$_POST array recursively (as arrays can contain arrays and so forth) and
run the names and variables through htmlspecialchars() except for the
password field which of course should be able to have special characters
in them.

The reason you don’t do it this way in new applications is because now
if for some reason someone has another way of interacting with your
application (by API calls for example) you’d have to sanitize your input
on both sides. Moreover, APIs that pass JSON objects around for example,
don’t need to have script tags encoded as it means nothing to them and
JSON objects are encoded in a different way. In this case however,
DAViCal doesn’t have other entry points which you can use to insert data
in the database. So sanitizing all input once will suffice!

About DAViCal
=============

DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation of the
CalDAV protocol which is designed for storing calendaring resources on a
remote shared server. It can be used by various eâmail and calendaring
clients to centrally store and share calendars.

It includes a web-based management application. It was in these pages
that we discovered this vulnerability.

Affected systems
================

DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 and prior

Overview
========

The application has no protection against CSRF attacks. If an
authenticated user visits an attacker-controlled webpage (for example,
in another browser tab), the attacker can send arbitrary requests in the
name of the user to the application, including requests that result in a
state change.

For example, if an attacker includes the following HTML code on his/âher
site and an authenticated DAViCal administrator visits, a new
administrative account â"hacker" (password also â"hacker") will
automatically be created in the background, giving the attacker full
access to the calendaring application:

<html>
<body>
<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
<form action="<http://davical.host/admin.php?action=edit&t=principal>"
method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">

Impact
======

In a successful CSRF attack, the attacker can change the eâmail address
and password on a victim's account, which results in a full account
takeover. If the compromised user has a privileged (administrator) role
within the application, then the attacker is also able to add a new
administrator user.

Solution
========

Update to version 1.1.9.1

Technical solution details
==========================

The most robust way to defend against CSRF attacks is to include a CSRF
token within relevant requests. The idea is that you assign a unique
token to a user's session, this token can be regenerated whenever but
this usually happens when a new session is created (e.g.when the user
logs out and logs back in). This token is then required to be sent along
with the rest of the data you want to submit. Prior to performing the
action the called route is supposed to perform(let's say you want to
update your user information) the application will check if a CSRF token
is present and whether it's the right one. Onab.comce those two checks
pass the application will continue executing.

So the first task was to write a library that would generate a CSRF
token and attach it to the session. That's all pretty basic, the only
thing I had to take into account is that the current requirement for
DAViCal is PHP 5.6.0 and up so I had to keep backwards compatibility in
mind. The token is generated by a random number generator (which one is
decided by the current PHP version) and then assigned to the user. Once
that was done the only thing left is to make sure every information
altering request verifies the CSRF token.

The modern way most web frameworks will handle this is by using
middleware. Let's say you map a route to a function in your code,you can
then put a CSRF middleware in the middle of that ââmapping'. So let's
say you've got the following mapping:

â/âuser/âinformation/âupdate'> updateUserInformation();

You'd then tell your framework to use a CSRF middleware which would
change the flow to:

â/âuser/âinformation/âupdate'> checkCSRF(); > updateUserInformation();

DAViCal however is quite an old project (the copyright states 2006 as
starting year) and we don't have the luxury of a framework handling
these things for us. The easiest solution is to find every place a
POSTrequest is made and manually verifying the token at those places.
But I was keen to find out if there was a more central place I could put
the CSRF verifying function. As every developer will know, getting to
know and understand someone else's code can be quite a tough one. I
found myself using xdebugquite a lot to figure out the flow of the
application until something quite obvious became apparent. There is a
PHP file in the project called ââalways.php' which always runs. This
file can be used to launch a function on every page load. This is where
I added a function to check the CSRF token on POST requests (which are
used in DAViCal to alter information).

The final act was adding the CSRF tokens to all the forms in DAViCal
which could be easily found by searching for </form>. Which concluded
the fix for the CSRF vulnerability in DAViCal.

# CVE-2019 – 18346 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in DAViCal CalDAV Server

At HackDefense, we were evaluating various calendaring solutions, and during installation and configuration of [DAViCal](https://www.davical.org/) we discovered three (severe) vulnerabilities. We reported these vulnerabilities to the vendor. Unfortunately, the DAViCal project itself was not able to fix these vulnerabilities. As DAViCal is an open source project we decided to contribute patches for these vulnerabilities ourselves. DAViCal has accepted our patches in the [1.1.9.2 release](https://wiki.davical.org/index.php/Release_Notes/1.1.9.2). If you use DAViCal as a calendaring server, we recommend upgrading to version 1.1.9.2 immediately to remediate the issues we’ve discovered.

All three vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management pages that come with DAViCal. We have written three separate advisories to describe the vulnerabilities:

1. [`CVE-2019-18345` — Reflected Cross-Site Scripting](https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18345-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability)
2. `CVE-2019-18346` – (this advisory) Cross-Site Request Forgery
3. [`CVE-2019-18347` – Persistent Cross-Site Scripting](https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18347-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability)

## About DAViCal

DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation of the [CalDAV protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) which is designed for storing calendaring resources on a remote shared server. It can be used by various e‑mail and calendaring clients to centrally store and share calendars.

It includes a web-based management application. It was in these pages that we discovered this vulnerability.

## Affected systems

DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 and prior

## Overview

The application has no protection against CSRF attacks. If an authenticated user visits an attacker-controlled webpage (for example, in another browser tab), the attacker can send arbitrary requests in the name of the user to the application, including requests that result in a state change.

For example, if an attacker includes the following HTML code on his/​her site and an authenticated DAViCal administrator visits, a new administrative account ​“hacker” (password also ​“hacker”) will automatically be created in the background, giving the attacker full access to the calendaring application:

<html>

<script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
<form action="http://davical.host/admin.php?action=edit&t=principal" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">

# CVE-2019 – 18347 Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in DAViCal CalDAV Server

At HackDefense, we were evaluating various calendaring solutions, and during installation and configuration of [DAViCal](https://www.davical.org/) we discovered three (severe) vulnerabilities. We reported these vulnerabilities to the vendor. Unfortunately, the DAViCal project itself was not able to fix these vulnerabilities. As DAViCal is an open source project we decided to contribute patches for these vulnerabilities ourselves. DAViCal has accepted our patches in the [1.1.9.2 release](https://wiki.davical.org/index.php/Release_Notes/1.1.9.2). If you use DAViCal as a calendaring server, we recommend upgrading to version 1.1.9.2 immediately to remediate the issues we’ve discovered.

All three vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management pages that come with DAViCal. We have written three separate advisories to describe the vulnerabilities:

1. [`CVE-2019-18345` — Reflected Cross-Site Scripting](https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18345-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability)
2. [`CVE-2019-18346` — Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18346-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability)
3. `CVE-2019-18347` — (this advisory) Persistent Cross-Site Scripting

| CVE Reference | CVE-2019-18347 |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS score | 9.9 |
| CVSS vector | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H |

## About DAViCal

DAViCal is a server for calendar sharing. It is an implementation of the [CalDAV protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CalDAV) which is designed for storing calendaring resources on a remote shared server. It can be used by various e‑mail and calendaring clients to centrally store and share calendars.

It includes a web-based management application. It was in these pages that we discovered this vulnerability.

## Affected systems

DAViCal CalDAV Server 1.1.8 and prior

## Overview

The application does not validate user input like email addresses, usernames and display names. In addition, the web application does not encode these user input when echoing them to in the web pages. An attack with a low privileged account can exploit these issues to execute a Persistent Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attack.

POC URL: `http://davical.host/admin.php?action=edit&t=principal&id=1`

Place a XSS payload in the *username* or *fullname* field:

![Davical cve 2019 18347](/imager/images/cve-2019-18347-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability/9522/davical-cve-2019-18347_7339dddc601bbd0da886efdc3485d9c1.png)
## Impact

An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious JavaScript to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because the browser thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious JavaScript can access session tokens (without the `HttpOnly` flag) or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site in the context of the victim.

If the user is administrator, the attacker can for example change the password of the user to take over the account and gain full access to the application.

In this case, because the Javascript is stored in the database and included in pages others can open, it can be used by one user to attack other users on the same system.

Combined with a CSRF attack (see [CVE-2019 – 18346](https://hackdefense.com/publications/cve-2019-18346-davical-caldav-server-vulnerability)) it is possible to attack users from the outside as well, if an authenticated DAViCal user visits the attacker’s web site.

## Solution

Update to version 1.1.9.2

## Technical solution details

XSS vulnerabilities are a problem with dynamically generated websites that use user input. If user input is not correctly sanitized you could very well end up with a user pushing some Javascript to your frontend.

XSS isn’t a vulnerability that’s hard to grasp or circumvent but it’s awfully easy to make a mistake like that. One thing you’ll hear over and over again is never to trust user input. Always sanitize it when it comes in and it’s best to still not trust it then. Characters like `<`, `>` and `"` should never be rawly echoed to the frontend. The use cases for echoing user input back to the frontend are endless. From a simple `Greetings, $username` to editing personal user information with the form having all the fields already filled in. So when someone has a quote in their name, you shouldn’t echo the raw quote but `&­quot;`.

These days web frameworks handle a lot of sanitation for us. Laravel for example uses simple brackets to echo variables to the user all these variables are escaped first: `{{ $username }}`. Twig does something similar by using a pipe like syntax: `{{ $username | escape}}`.

These days when developing your application you need to make sure you sanitize everything you output to the user. But since DAViCal is an established project it’s not doable to sift through the code to look for functions that output text to the frontend. Another problem was that DAViCal dynamically adds `GET` parameters to echoed urls. This is why I chose to sanitize both incoming variables and their names. In the DAViCal `always.php` I added a function that loops through the `$_GET` and `$_POST` array recursively (as arrays can contain arrays and so forth) and run the names and variables through `htmlspecialchars()` except for the password field which of course should be able to have special characters in them.

The reason you don’t do it this way in new applications is because now if for some reason someone has another way of interacting with your application (by API calls for example) you’d have to sanitize your input on both sides. Moreover, APIs that pass JSON objects around for example, don’t need to have script tags encoded as it means nothing to them and JSON objects are encoded in a different way. In this case however, DAViCal doesn’t have other entry points which you can use to insert data in the database. So sanitizing all input once will suffice!
