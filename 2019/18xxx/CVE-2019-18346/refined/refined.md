  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2019-18346",
      "root_cause": "The DAViCal application lacks protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to send malicious requests on behalf of an authenticated user.",
		"No CSRF tokens are used to protect against forged requests"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can perform actions in the name of an authenticated user, potentially leading to account takeover.  For example, an attacker could create a new administrative account, change user passwords, or modify user information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can craft a malicious web page containing a form that sends requests to the DAViCal server, leveraging a logged-in user's active session."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince an authenticated user to visit a malicious webpage while the user is logged into the DAViCal application. The attacker does not need prior knowledge of the victim's credentials."
