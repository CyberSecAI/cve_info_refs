{
  "CVE-2019-18812": {
    "Description": "A memory leak in the `sof_dfsentry_write()` function in `sound/soc/sof/debug.c` in the Linux kernel allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).",
    "Root cause": "Memory allocated for string is leaked in the `sof_dfsentry_write()` function if an error occurs when `d_name.name` is not valid.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (memory consumption). A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Local access to the system"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to trigger a condition leading to failure when writing to debugfs entries"
