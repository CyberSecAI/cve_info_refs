Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper access control within the 'E-Mail' AddOn for eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 devices. Specifically, the `save.cgi` script allows unauthenticated users to upload a payload containing TCL code. Subsequently, the `testtcl.cgi` script executes this uploaded code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication and authorization checks on the `save.cgi` and `testtcl.cgi` scripts, allowing unauthenticated access to them.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to upload and execute arbitrary TCL code through the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the CCU device with root privileges. This enables complete control of the device.
- **System Compromise:**  Attackers can potentially compromise the entire smart home system, gain access to sensitive data, modify configurations, or use the device for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed via crafted HTTP POST and GET requests to the `save.cgi` and `testtcl.cgi` scripts.
- **Web Interface Access:** The attacker requires access to the web interface of the Homematic CCU device. This could be from the local network or through the internet if port forwarding is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the Homematic CCU device's web interface.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials. The vulnerability is exploitable without any authentication.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 devices with the 'E-Mail' AddOn version 1.6.8.c and prior.
- A patch was released in version 1.7.0 of the 'E-Mail' AddOn.
- The exploit can be achieved by:
    1. Sending a POST request to `save.cgi` with TCL code to be executed, potentially using system.Exec() commands or CUxD commands.
    2. Sending a GET request to `testtcl.cgi` to trigger the execution of the previously uploaded TCL code.
- The blog post mentions that the vendor eQ-3 initially stated they are "not responsible for AddOns" and then the author contacted the Addon developer.
