{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free (UAF) error in `ni_dhcp6_fsm_parse_client_options()`. When the function receives a DHCPv6 packet with invalid client options, it frees the `msg->lease` pointer but does not set it to NULL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability. The program frees memory, but continues to hold a pointer to the memory, leading to potential use of the freed memory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The use-after-free vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious DHCPv6 packet with invalid client options, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "A network attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted DHCPv6 packet with invalid client options.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send network packets to the target system's DHCPv6 interface. This implies being on the same network segment or having the ability to route packets to the vulnerable machine."
