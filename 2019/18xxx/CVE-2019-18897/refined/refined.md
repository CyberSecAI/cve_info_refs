  "CVE-2019-18897": {
    "description": "A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in the packaging of salt of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15; openSUSE Factory allows local attackers to escalate privileges from user salt to root.",
    "affected_versions": "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 salt-master version 2019.2.0-46.83.1 and prior versions. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 salt-master version 2019.2.0-6.21.1 and prior versions. openSUSE Factory salt-master version 2019.2.2-3.1 and prior versions.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a symlink following issue in the %post script of the salt-master package. During an upgrade, a `chown` command is used to change the ownership of files in `/etc/salt/pki/master/` and `/var/cache/salt/master`. By creating a symlink to a sensitive file, an attacker can manipulate the `chown` command to change the ownership of that sensitive file to the `salt` user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Symlink Following",
      "Incorrect file ownership handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation from the `salt` user to `root`. An attacker could potentially read sensitive data, modify system files, or execute arbitrary code with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the system as the `salt` user.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be exploited on systems with `fs.protected_hardlinks=0`. The `chown` command in line 1230 can also be used for DoS by making files unavailable."
