Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an **Unquoted Search Path or Element (CWE-428)**. This means that the application's executable path is not enclosed in quotation marks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The application searches for resources or executables using a path that does not have quotation marks. This allows an attacker to place a malicious executable in a higher-priority directory within the search path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Crash the system.
    - View sensitive data.
    - Execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An authenticated user with local access can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to place a malicious executable in a location within the search path that is prioritized over the legitimate one, so when the application searches for the file it finds the malicious one first.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated local user.
- The attacker must have the ability to write files to the file system, specifically within the application's search path.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Reliable Controls LicenseManager versions 3.4 and prior.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- The vendor has released version 3.5, bundled with the latest RC-Studio software to address the issue. They recommend upgrading to RC Studio 3.6.3.
-  The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
