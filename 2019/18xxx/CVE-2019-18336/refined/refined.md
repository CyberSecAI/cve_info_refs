- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (Profinet) could cause the affected device to go into defect mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) leading to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The affected device goes into defect mode, requiring a restart to recover the system, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to port 102/tcp (Profinet).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker needs network access to port 102/tcp. No user interaction is required.
