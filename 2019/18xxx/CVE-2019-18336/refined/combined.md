SSA-508982: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in SIMATIC S7-300
CPUs, SIMATIC TDC, and SINUMERIK Controller over Proﬁnet

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

SUMMARY

The latest ﬁrmware update for the S7-300 CPUs ﬁxes a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated
attacker with network access to cause a denial-of-service condition. SINUMERIK 840D sl Controller,
which contains a S7-300 CPU, is also affected, as well as SIMATIC TDC.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends that customers update to
the latest version(s).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Make sure that access to port 102/tcp is restricted e.g. with an external ﬁrewall.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Products of the Siemens SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family have been designed for discrete and continuous
control in industrial environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries
worldwide.

SINUMERIK CNC offers automation solutions for the shop ﬂoor, job shops and large serial production
environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

SIMATIC TDC is a multiprocessor automation system for drive, control and technology tasks. The system
is used particularly for large plants.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-18336

Specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp (Proﬁnet) could cause the affected device to go into
defect mode. A restart is required in order to recover the system.

Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have network access to port 102/tcp, with no authenti-
cation. No user interation is required.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
