The provided content details multiple crashes in EximiousSoft Logo Designer 3.82, discovered through fuzzing. Here's a breakdown of the four specific cases:

**Case #01:**

*   **Root Cause:** A write access violation occurs in the `ExiVectorRender!StrokeText_Blend` function.
*   **Vulnerability:**  The code attempts to write to a memory location pointed to by `eax`, which is an invalid address `007e0003`.
*  **Impact:** The application crashes.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a specific `.eld` file, a user can trigger the crash when the file is opened in Logo Designer.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft/modify the .eld file and open it using the vulnerable software.

**Case #02:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap corruption is detected within `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The heap corruption is detected during the execution of `ExiVecLib::CExiCurve4::vertex` function, after a call chain involving the rendering process.
*   **Impact:** The application crashes with a heap corruption error, a condition that is considered exploitable.
*   **Attack Vector:** A specially crafted `.eld` file can trigger the heap corruption by being opened in the application.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft/modify the .eld file and open it using the vulnerable software.

**Case #03:**

*   **Root Cause:** A write access violation occurs within `ExiCustomPathLib!ExiCustomPathLib::CGradientColorsProfile::BuildGradientColorsTable`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The code attempts to write to a memory location at `[ebx+edx*4]` which resolves to the invalid address `0x3270000`.
*   **Impact:** The application crashes due to the access violation.
*  **Attack Vector:** By loading a malformed `.eld` file, an attacker can trigger the crash.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft/modify the .eld file and open it using the vulnerable software.

**Case #04:**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to Case #02, heap corruption is detected within `ntdll!RtlpNtMakeTemporaryKey`.
*   **Vulnerability:** The heap corruption is triggered during the rendering and memory management operations involving `ExiImageTransform::CExiSingleFrmGIFOptimal::operator=+` and `mfc100u`.
*   **Impact:** The application crashes with a heap corruption error, which can be exploited.
*   **Attack Vector:** A crafted `.eld` file can trigger the heap corruption by being opened by the application.
*  **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft/modify the .eld file and open it using the vulnerable software.

**General Summary:**

*   **Weaknesses:** The software exhibits multiple memory corruption vulnerabilities, including write access violations and heap corruption issues. These are triggered during the rendering and processing of vector graphics, specifically when handling text, gradients, and custom paths.
*   **Impact:** All identified vulnerabilities result in application crashes. The heap corruption cases are specifically classified as "exploitable," suggesting potential for more severe outcomes like arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** All vulnerabilities are triggered by loading a specially crafted `.eld` file into the application.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to craft/modify the .eld file and open it using the vulnerable software.
