Subject: CVE-2019-18932: sarg: insecure usage of /tmp/sarg allows privilege
 escalation / DoS attack vector

Hello,

sarg [1] is a tool that generates HTML reports from Squid web proxy
logfiles. Typically these reports are generated automatically via cron
jobs on a regular basis (e.g. through entries in
/etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly}).

In the course of a code review [2] of sarg it turned out that it uses a
fixed path in /tmp/sarg by default to store files (log.c:571). sarg
employs a couple of system calls to check for an already existing
/tmp/sarg directory and tries to reuse it by deleting its contents
(log.c:588). The system calls used for this logic are subject to race
conditions. Since sarg runs as 'root' this behaviour allows
unprivileged local users to prepare symlink attacks.

By winning a race condition an attacker will be able to let new files be
created or existing files be overwritten in privileged locations. This
presents a denial-of-service attack vector and possibly also a privilege
escalation in some circumstances. Since the content of the files that
are created cannot be controlled by the attacker (as far I can tell)
there is no easy full privilege escalation to root possible.

A mitigation for this weakness can be to pass the '-w' switch to
invocations of /usr/bin/sarg which allows to explicitly specify a
safe temporary directory to use. Also in the openSUSE packaging the cron
jobs for sarg don't invoke sarg if not explicitly enabled in
/etc/sysconfig/sarg. On Debian 9, however, for example, the cron jobs
seem to run unconditionally after installing sarg.

To make sarg safe, the file handlings parts will need to be completely
revised. An improvement could also be not to run sarg as 'root' user at
all but instead share the 'squid' user account, if possible. The
upstream maintainer communicated to me that this should be possible
without loss of functionality.

The attached suggested patch adjust the sarg-reports wrapper script to
pass a safe and unpredictable temporary directory name to sarg to
prevent the security issues described, at least when called from the
cron job context.

I've informed the upstream maintainer about this issue on 2019-11-13 and
discussed various aspects of a suitable security fix with him. No
agreement on a suitable publication date for this finding or a final
patch could be achieved and I did not hear back for around a month by
now.

Best Regards

Matthias

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-13 13:53:49 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1150554](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554 "RESOLVED FIXED - AUDIT-1: sarg: review of cron job file(s): /etc/cron.daily/suse.de-sarg, /etc/cron.monthly/suse.de-sarg, /etc/cron.weekly/suse.de-sarg")  A finding from the cron job review for sarg. sarg insecurely uses a fixed path in /tmp/sarg as root which allows local symlink attacks:  It turned out that it uses a fixed path in /tmp/sarg by default to store files (log.c:571). sarg employs a couple of system calls to check for an already existing /tmp/sarg directory and tries to reuse it by deleting its contents (log.c:588). The used system calls are subject to race conditions.  Since sarg runs as 'root' this behaviour allows unprivileged local users to prepare symlink attacks.  By winning a race condition an attacker will be able to let new files be created or existing files be overwritten in privileged locations. This presents a denial-of-service attack vector and possibly also a privilege escalation in some circumstances. Since the content of the files that are created cannot be controlled by the attacker (as far I can tell) there's no easy full privilege escalation possible.  A mitigation for this weakness can be to pass the '-w' switch to invocations of /usr/bin/sarg which allows to explicitly specify a temporary directory to use. On openSUSE the cron jobs for sarg don't invoke sarg if not explicitly enabled in /etc/sysconfig/sarg. On Debian 9, for example, the cron jobs seem to run unconditionally after installing sarg.  There seems to have been little activity upstream in recent years. To make sarg safe, the file handlings parts will need to be completely revised. An improvement could also be not to run sarg as 'root' user at all but instead share the 'squid' user account, if possible. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-13 14:05:31 UTC  ``` For now I have privately reported this to the upstream maintainer. I want to give him a chance to prepare for this before it is published. Therefore let's treat this issue privately for the moment.  For fixing this in our packaging I recommend two steps:  1) invoke sarg with a suitable -w parameter in /usr/sbin/sarg-reports 2) let sarg only run as e.g. the squid user anymore. A quick test showed that    this basically works. More intensive testing will be required, however. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-13 15:02:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 824051](attachment.cgi?id=824051) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824051&action=edit) merged cron script with setpriv invocation ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-13 15:21:33 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 824054](attachment.cgi?id=824054&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824054&action=edit) safer sarg invocation with -w ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-13 15:37:27 UTC  ``` So I made a first attempt at fixing this issue:  - in [attachment 824051](attachment.cgi?id=824051) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824051&action=edit) you'll find a new cron job script that can now also be   used generically for all three cron job types. This script will use setprivs   to lower privileges to the squid user. - in [attachment 824054](attachment.cgi?id=824054&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824054&action=edit) there's a patch against sarg-reports that passes a safe   temporary directory to sarg via the '-w' switch. - a third ingredient will be so adjust the spec file to install directories   like /srv/www/sarg with ownership for the squid user. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-22 13:59:14 UTC  ``` I've got a reply from the upstream dev but he says sarg is basically unmaintained and he's got no time to fix this until the end of the year. And even then he's unsure as to how to fix it. Because he's concerned of leftover temporary directories in /tmp.  I think we'll be able to publish this finding next week and I also think that the patches I provided will at least fix the inherent security issue coming from the cron job. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c7)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-26 09:00:07 UTC  ``` Further communication with the upstream dev continues to revolve around leftover temporary directories, which he seems more concerned about than the obvious symlink attack in the current version. He's currently aversed to using unpredictable temporary directory names but would rather like to use a non stadard directry that is not world accessible like in /var/lib/sarg.  I'm still trying to find out if running sarg as the squid user is a supported mode of operation for sarg.  The sarg-reports script in [attachment 824054](attachment.cgi?id=824054&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824054&action=edit) should also get a trap handler to remove temporary directories in case an interactive user aborts the script.  I'll try another couple of rounds discussing this with the upstream dev. For fixing the security issue at hand we don't need to reach a perfect solution, just a safe one that doesn't break functionality for end users. If upstream comes up with a super nice and super safe update then we can happily package that. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c8)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-27 09:42:27 UTC  ``` So the upstream dev finally confirmed that it's okay to run sarg as an unprivileged user. It just needs to be able to read the squid log file and to write to the report output directory. Thus using the 'squid' user also for sarg sounds like a good solution to me.  @tabraham: It would be nice if you could adjust the packaging accordingly. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c10)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-20 13:55:29 UTC  ``` Publishing this CVE, the CRD has been reached. Upstream remains unresponsive. Please add the path to the devel project / Factory and submit maintenance updates! Thank you. ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643#c11)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-21 09:39:13 UTC  ``` I've published this to oss-sec [1]. I've also added the posting as a public reference to the CVE via Mitre's web form to have them publish the CVE in their database.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c0)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-09-12 12:04:17 UTC  ``` +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1150175](show_bug.cgi?id=1150175 "RESOLVED FIXED") As discussed in the proactive security team we want to restrict the installation of cron job files in the future. To achieve this we first need to cover the currently existing packages that do this.  sarg installs the following cron files:  - /etc/cron.daily/suse.de-sarg - /etc/cron.monthly/suse.de-sarg - /etc/cron.weekly/suse.de-sarg  They should be reviewed and whitelisted when all is well. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c1)  Matthias Gerstner   2019-11-13 11:22:26 UTC  ``` The good news is: Those cron jobs don't act by default, only if explicitly enabled in /etc/sysconfig/sarg.  The bad news is: If this sarg program actually runs then there are a lot of worries regarding handling of temporary files. Both the sarg-report script and the C program sarg use questionable temporary file handling.  Especially the sarg C program uses the fixed directory /tmp/sarg by default and a lot of racy system calls to create the dir and files within the dir. This allows at a minimum local users to place symlinks in there and corrupt system files. Arbitrary code execution should be not included but I can't fully say. This is also worty a CVE assignment.  The purpose of sarg is to scan the squid access.log logfile and generate a report from it. This task could possibly also be fullfilled without root privileges e.g. running as the squid user. This would make things a lot safer and robust.  The upstream project is pretty inactive. Only once minor release in 2018, the one before was in 2015.  Given all the circumstances this might even be a candidate for removal from openSUSE. Code quality certainly is not good! ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c3)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-01-30 10:59:29 UTC  ``` Still waiting for [bug 1156643](show_bug.cgi?id=1156643 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2019-18932: sarg: insecure usage of /tmp/sarg allows privilege escalation / DoS vector") to be fixed in Factory before a whitelisting can be made. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c4)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-02-27 13:40:07 UTC  ``` I still wanted to harden the way sarg is executed. The upstream author confirmed to me that the squid user is sufficient to run sarg. Therefore I'd like the merged and adjusted cron job script from [attachment 824051](attachment.cgi?id=824051) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=824051&action=edit) to be used before I whitelist this cron job.  I created a submission sr#779928 that does this. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c5)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-02-28 09:48:09 UTC  ``` I have replaced the submission by sr#780202 in the meantime. In the original approach only the cron job dropped privileges. But this could have caused additional security issues when somebody calls sarg-reports a different way (e.g. manually on the command line).  Therefore I've moved the privilege drop code into the sarg-reports script itself. It now drops privilege to the owner:group of the /srv/www/sarg directory. This also allows users to easily restore the original behaviour with sarg running as root, if desired for some reason. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c6)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-03-04 10:13:37 UTC  ``` My submit request from [comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c5) was accepted by now and I also submitted a whitelisting for the new cron job files and the privilege drop code. Therefore we can close this bug as FIXED. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c7)  Thomas Abraham   2020-03-27 15:59:28 UTC  ``` I got an email about sarg build failing in factory since March 19th. I'm assuming that they haven't been whitelisted yet? Log shows:   [   30s] sarg.x86_64: E: cronjob-changed-file (Badness: 10000) /etc/cron.daily/suse.de-sarg [   30s] sarg.x86_64: E: cronjob-changed-file (Badness: 10000) /etc/cron.monthly/suse.de-sarg [   30s] sarg.x86_64: E: cronjob-changed-file (Badness: 10000) /etc/cron.weekly/suse.de-sarg [   30s] A cron job or cron job related file installed by this package changed [   30s] in content.

[   30s]  [   30s] (none): E: badness 30000 exceeds threshold 1000, aborting. ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c8)  Malte Kraus   2020-03-27 17:27:24 UTC  ``` There's a whitelisting in place, but something about it is broken. I've opened <https://github.com/openSUSE/rpmlint-security-whitelistings/issues/5> to track this. ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1150554#c9)  Matthias Gerstner   2020-04-01 13:37:35 UTC  ``` A fix is on the way via sr#790150 to Factory.  Sorry for the inconvenience, turned out test coverage was still not high enough for the new rpmlint-check. ``` |  |

# CVE-2019-18932: sarg: insecure usage of /tmp/sarg allows privilege escalation / DoS attack vector

---

*From*: Matthias Gerstner <mgerstner () suse de>

```
Hello,

sarg [1] is a tool that generates HTML reports from Squid web proxy
logfiles. Typically these reports are generated automatically via cron
jobs on a regular basis (e.g. through entries in
/etc/cron.{daily,weekly,monthly}).

In the course of a code review [2] of sarg it turned out that it uses a
fixed path in /tmp/sarg by default to store files (log.c:571). sarg
employs a couple of system calls to check for an already existing
/tmp/sarg directory and tries to reuse it by deleting its contents
(log.c:588). The system calls used for this logic are subject to race
conditions. Since sarg runs as 'root' this behaviour allows
unprivileged local users to prepare symlink attacks.

By winning a race condition an attacker will be able to let new files be
created or existing files be overwritten in privileged locations. This
presents a denial-of-service attack vector and possibly also a privilege
escalation in some circumstances. Since the content of the files that
are created cannot be controlled by the attacker (as far I can tell)
there is no easy full privilege escalation to root possible.

A mitigation for this weakness can be to pass the '-w' switch to
invocations of /usr/bin/sarg which allows to explicitly specify a
safe temporary directory to use. Also in the openSUSE packaging the cron
jobs for sarg don't invoke sarg if not explicitly enabled in
/etc/sysconfig/sarg. On Debian 9, however, for example, the cron jobs
seem to run unconditionally after installing sarg.

To make sarg safe, the file handlings parts will need to be completely
revised. An improvement could also be not to run sarg as 'root' user at
all but instead share the 'squid' user account, if possible. The
upstream maintainer communicated to me that this should be possible
without loss of functionality.

The attached suggested patch adjust the sarg-reports wrapper script to
pass a safe and unpredictable temporary directory name to sarg to
prevent the security issues described, at least when called from the
cron job context.

I've informed the upstream maintainer about this issue on 2019-11-13 and
discussed various aspects of a suitable security fix with him. No
agreement on a suitable publication date for this finding or a final
patch could be achieved and I did not hear back for around a month by
now.

Best Regards

Matthias

# CVE-2019-18932

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-18928.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-18934.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-18932 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18932)

#### Description

log.c in Squid Analysis Report Generator (sarg) through 2.3.11 allows local privilege escalation. By default, it uses a fixed temporary directory /tmp/sarg. As the root user, sarg creates this directory or reuses an existing one in an insecure manner. An attacker can pre-create the directory, and place symlinks in it (after winning a /tmp/sarg/denied.int\_unsort race condition). The outcome will be corrupted or newly created files in privileged file system locations.
