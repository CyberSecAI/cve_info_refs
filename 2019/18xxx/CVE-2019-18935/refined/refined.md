Here's the information extracted from the provided content regarding CVE-2019-18935:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Insecure deserialization of JSON objects within the RadAsyncUpload component of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX. Specifically, the `AsyncUploadHandler` processes the `rauPostData` POST parameter, which contains a serialized object *and* the object's type. It uses the provided type to prepare .NET's `JavaScriptSerializer.Deserialize()` method. If an attacker can control the type, they can specify an RCE gadget type like `System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller` which, combined with a malicious DLL path, can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application uses `JavaScriptSerializer.Deserialize` to deserialize an object of a type specified by the attacker.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload (Prerequisite):** Exploitation requires breaking the encryption that protects the file upload configuration object in `rauPostData`.  Prior to R2 2017 SP1, RadAsyncUpload had a hardcoded key that allowed attackers to modify the `TempTargetFolder` and upload a file to an arbitrary location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server in the context of the `w3wp.exe` process.
*   **Complete System Compromise**: By chaining exploits for unrestricted file upload (CVE-2017-11317) and insecure deserialization (CVE-2019-18935), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on a remote server.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  The attacker first exploits the RadAsyncUploadâ€™s encryption (or uses the default key) to send a malicious request. This requires control over the `rauPostData` POST parameter.
2.  The attacker leverages the arbitrary file upload to upload a malicious mixed-mode assembly (DLL).
3.  The attacker then sends another request that exploits the insecure deserialization of the object type to trigger the execution of the uploaded DLL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the `Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau` endpoint on a vulnerable server.
*   For pre-2017 versions of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, the attacker must be able to break the weak encryption of the `rauPostData` parameter (or use the default encryption key).
*   The target web server needs to have write permissions to the `TempTargetFolder` directory specified by the attacker.
*   The attacker must have access to or be able to craft a malicious .NET mixed-mode assembly (DLL).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX and is exploited using `System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller`.
*   The exploit chain often involves the use of a mixed-mode assembly DLL, which allows execution of unmanaged (native) code when a .NET assembly is loaded.
*   The vulnerability is often chained with an unrestricted file upload vulnerability, as the attacker needs a way to upload their malicious DLL payload.
*  The vulnerability impacts versions Q1 2011 (2011.1.315) to R3 2019 (2019.3.917).
*   Successful exploitation can occur if type whitelisting for RadAsyncUpload is not enabled or bypassed.
*  The vulnerability is a frequently exploited CVE by state-sponsored threat actors.
*   The `AssemblyInstaller` object's `Path` property points to the location of the malicious DLL on the filesystem.
*   The shellcode/loader payload that leverages the CLR Hosting API is often generated using a tool like Donut.

**Patch/Mitigation Information:**
*   Upgrade Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX to R1 2020 (2020.1.114) or later.
*   Review the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security) and configure recommended security settings, including enabling the `AllowedCustomMetaDataTypes` setting.
*   Disable the built-in RadAsyncUpload handler by setting the **Telerik.Web.DisableAsyncUploadHandler** key to **true** and implement a custom handler with the required security.
*   Implement a centralized patch management system and patch as soon as possible.
*   Monitor and analyze web server activity logs for suspicious activity.
