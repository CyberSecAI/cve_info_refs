Subject: CVE-2019-18960: Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 vsock buffer overflow

We have identified an issue in the Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 vsock
implementation.

# Issue Description

A logical error in bounds checking performed on vsock virtio descriptors
can be used by a malicious guest to read from and write to a segment of
the host-side Firecracker process' heap address space, directly after
the end of a guest memory region. For reads, the accessible segment's
size is 64 KiB. For writes, the accessible segment is limited by the
host Linux kernel to a size defined in /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max. We
expect the value of rmem_max to be on the order of a few hundred KiB to
a few MiB.

# Impact

This will generally result in a segmentation fault, but remote code
execution within the Firecracker host-side process context cannot be
ruled out.

# Vulnerable Systems

Only Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 are affected. Only Firecracker
microVMs with configured vsock devices are affected, and only if one or
more vsock devices are in active use by both host and guest.

# Mitigation

Patched binaries for the affected versions have been released as
Firecracker v0.18.1 [1] and Firecracker v0.19.1 [2].
If you are using Firecracker v0.18.0 or v0.19.0 , we recommend you apply
the provided fix. If you are using Firecracker v0.17.0 or below, you do
not need to take any action.
In a remote code execution scenario, users running Firecracker in line
with the recommended Production Host Setup will see the impact limited
as follows: a malicious microVM guest that would manage to compromise
the Firecracker VMM process would be restricted to running on the host
as an unprivileged user, in a chroot and mount namespace isolated from
the host's filesystem, in a separate pid namespace, in a separate
network namespace, with system calls limited to Firecracker's seccomp
whitelist, on a single NUMA node, and on a cgroups-limited number of CPU
cores.

Subject: Re: CVE-2019-18960: Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 vsock buffer overflow

Hi,

FWIW, Valentina Palmiotti @chompie1337 and her colleagues at Grapl have
recently looked into exploiting the below vulnerability, and blogged
about it here:

<https://www.graplsecurity.com/post/attacking-firecracker>

The attempts so far have bumped into guard pages, some of unidentified
origin.  Maybe someone else will want to continue this research.

The blog post above includes a lot of other observations, not limited to
this one vulnerability and its exploitation, but also covering VMMs,
Firecracker vs. QEMU, Rust "unsafe" blocks, guard pages, hardening.

I guess further research could be to identify the source of all guard
pages observed, see if they're created consistently and reliably across
all platforms, harden that if not.  This could help mitigate some other
vulnerabilities, maybe in other Rust programs.

## Description

![@acatangiu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31917973?u=3a1cb3779c4aab2e2cfa01598cdde1b7051556a3&v=4&size=48)[acatangiu](https://github.com/acatangiu)opened [on Dec 9, 2019](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/1462#issue-535373916)

We have identified an issue in the Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 vsock implementation.

### Issue Description

A logical error in bounds checking performed on vsock virtio descriptors can be used by a malicious guest to read from and write to a segment of the host-side Firecracker process' heap address space, directly after the end of a guest memory region. For reads, the accessible segment's size is 64 KiB. For writes, the accessible segment is limited by the host Linux kernel to a size defined in `/proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max`. We expect the value of `rmem_max` to be on the order of a few hundred KiB to a few MiB.

### Impact

This will generally result in a segmentation fault, but remote code execution within the Firecracker host-side process context cannot be ruled out.

### Vulnerable Systems

Only Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 are affected. Only Firecracker microVMs with configured vsock devices are affected, and only if one or more vsock devices are in active use by both host and guest.

In a remote code execution scenario, users running Firecracker in line with the recommended Production Host Setup will see the impact limited as follows: a malicious microVM guest that would manage to compromise the Firecracker VMM process would be restricted to running on the host as an unprivileged user, in a chroot and mount namespace isolated from the host's filesystem, in a separate pid namespace, in a separate network namespace, with system calls limited to Firecracker's seccomp whitelist, on a single NUMA node, and on a cgroups-limited number of CPU cores.

### Mitigation

Firecracker v0.18.1 [1] and Firecracker v0.19.1 [2], released on 2019-12-09, addresses this issue. The fix has also been applied to Firecracker's master branch.

If you are using Firecracker v0.18.0 or v0.19.0, we recommend you update to v0.18.1 or v0.19.1 as soon as possible. If you are using Firecracker v0.17.0 or below, you do not need to take any action.

In a remote code execution scenario, users running Firecracker in line with the recommended Production Host Setup will limit the impact to the attacker's Firecracker process.

[Firecracker v1.10.0](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/tag/v1.10.0)

### Added

* [#4834](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4834): Add `VIRTIO_NET_F_RX_MRGBUF` support to the `virtio-net` device. When this feature is negotiated, guest `virtio-net` driver can perform more efficient memory management which in turn improves RX and TX performance.
* [#4460](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4460): Add a call to [`KVM_KVMCLOCK_CTRL`](https://docs.kernel.org/virt/kvm/api.html#kvm-kvmclock-ctrl) after pausing vCPUs on x86\_64 architectures. This ioctl sets a flag in the KVM state of the vCPU indicating that it has been paused by the host userspace. In guests that use kvmclock, the soft lockup watchdog checks this flag. If it is set, it won't trigger the lockup condition. Calling the ioctl for guests that don't use kvmclock will fail. These failures are not fatal. We log the failure and increase the `vcpu.kvmclock_ctrl_fails` metric.
* [#4869](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4869): Added support for Aarch64 systems which feature CPU caches with a number of sets higher than `u16::MAX`.
* [#4797](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4797), [#4854](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4854): Added GDB debugging support for a microVM guest kernel. Please see our [GDB debugging documentation](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.10.0/docs/gdb-debugging.md) for more information.

### Changed

* [#4844](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4844): Upgrade `virtio-net` device to use `readv` syscall to avoid unnecessary memory copies on RX path, increasing the RX performance.

### Removed

* [#4804](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4804): Drop Support for guest kernel 4.14. Linux 4.14 reached end-of-life in [January 2024](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2024011046-ecology-tiptoeing-ce50%40gregkh/) The minimum supported guest kernel now is 5.10.

### Fixed

* [#4796](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4796): Fixed Vsock not notifying guest about `TRANSPORT_RESET_EVENT` event after snapshot restore. This resulted in guest waiting indefinitely on a connection which was reset during snapshot creation.
* [#4790](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4790): v1.9.0 was missing most of the debugging information in the debuginfo file, due to a change in the Cargo defaults. This has been corrected.
* [#4826](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4826): Add missing configuration of tap offload features when restoring from a snapshot. Setting the features was previously [moved](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4680/commits/49ed5ea4b48ccd98903da037368fa3108f58ac1f) from net device creation to device activation time, but it was not reflected in the restore path. This was leading to inability to connect to the restored VM if the offload features were used.

[Firecracker v1.9.0](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/tag/v1.9.0)

### Added

* [#4687](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4687): Added VMGenID support for microVMs running on ARM hosts with 6.1 guest kernels. Support for VMGenID via DeviceTree bindings exists only on mainline 6.10 Linux onwards. Users of Firecracker will need to backport the relevant patches on top of their 6.1 kernels to make use of the feature.
* [#4732](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4732), [#4733](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4733), [#4741](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4741), [#4746](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4746): Added official support for 6.1 microVM guest kernels.

### Changed

### Deprecated

* Support for guest kernel 4.14 is now deprecated. We will completely remove 4.14 support with Firecracker version v1.10

### Removed

* [#4689](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4689): Drop support for host kernel 4.14. Linux 4.14 reached end-of-life in [January 2024](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/2024011046-ecology-tiptoeing-ce50%40gregkh/). The minimum supported kernel now is 5.10. Guest kernel 4.14 is still supported.

### Fixed

* [4680](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4680): Fixed an issue ([#4659](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/4659)) where the virtio-net device implementation would always assume the guest accepts all VirtIO features the device offers. This is always true with the Linux guest kernels we are testing but other kernels, like FreeBSD make different assumptions. This PR fixes the emulation code to set the TAP features based on the features accepted by the guest.

## Firecracker v1.8.0

[Firecracker v1.8.0](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/tag/v1.8.0)

### Added

* [#4428](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4428): Added ACPI support to Firecracker for x86\_64 microVMs. Currently, we pass ACPI tables with information about the available vCPUs, interrupt controllers, VirtIO and legacy x86 devices to the guest. This allows booting kernels without MPTable support. Please see our [kernel policy documentation](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.8.0/docs/kernel-policy.md) for more information regarding relevant kernel configurations.
* [#4487](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4487): Added support for the Virtual Machine Generation Identifier (VMGenID) device on x86\_64 platforms. VMGenID is a virtual device that allows VMMs to notify guests when they are resumed from a snapshot. Linux includes VMGenID support since version 5.18. It uses notifications from the device to reseed its internal CSPRNG. Please refer to [snapshot support](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.8.0/docs/snapshotting/snapshot-support.md) and [random for clones](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.8.0/docs/snapshotting/random-for-clones.md) documention for more info on VMGenID. VMGenID state is part of the snapshot format of Firecracker. As a result, Firecracker snapshot version is now 2.0.0.

### Changed

* [#4492](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4492): Changed `--config` parameter of `cpu-template-helper` optional. Users no longer need to prepare kernel, rootfs and Firecracker configuration files to use `cpu-template-helper`.
* [#4537](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4537) Changed T2CL template to pass through bit 27 and 28 of `MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES` (`RFDS_NO` and `RFDS_CLEAR`) since KVM consider they are able to be passed through and T2CL isn't designed for secure snapshot migration between different processors.
* [#4537](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4537) Changed T2S template to set bit 27 of `MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES` (`RFDS_NO`) to 1 since it assumes that the fleet only consists of processors that are not affected by RFDS.
* [#4388](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4388): Avoid setting `kvm_immediate_exit` to 1 if are already handling an exit, or if the vCPU is stopped. This avoids a spurious KVM exit upon restoring snapshots.
* [#4567](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4567): Do not initialize vCPUs in powered-off state upon snapshot restore. No functional change, as vCPU initialization is only relevant for the booted case (where the guest expects CPUs to be powered off).

### Deprecated

* Firecracker's `--start-time-cpu-us` and `--start-time-us` parameters are deprecated and will be removed in v2.0 or later. They are used by the jailer to pass the value that should be subtracted from the (CPU) time, when emitting the `start_time_us` and `start_time_cpu_us` metrics. These parameters were never meant to be used by end customers, and we recommend doing any such time adjustments outside Firecracker.
* Booting with microVM kernels that rely on MPTable on x86\_64 is deprecated and support will be removed in v2.0 or later. We suggest to users of Firecracker to use guest kernels with ACPI support. For x86\_64 microVMs, ACPI will be the only way Firecracker passes hardware information to the guest once MPTable support is removed.

### Fixed

* [#4526](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4526): Added a check in the network TX path that the size of the network frames the guest passes to us is not bigger than the maximum frame the device expects to handle. On the TX path, we copy frames destined to MMDS from guest memory to Firecracker memory. Without the check, a mis-behaving virtio-net driver could cause an increase in the memory footprint of the Firecracker process. Now, if we receive such a frame, we ignore it and increase `Net::tx_malformed_frames` metric.
* [#4536](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4536): Make the first differential snapshot taken after a full snapshot contain only the set of memory pages changed since the full snapshot. Previously, these differential snapshots would contain all memory pages. This will result in potentially much smaller differential snapshots after a full snapshot.
* [#4578](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4578): Fix UFFD support not being forward-compatible with new ioctl options introduced in Linux 6.6. See also [bytecodealliance/userfaultfd-rs#61](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/userfaultfd-rs/issues/61).
* [#4630](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4630): On x86\_64, when taking a snapshot, if a vCPU has MSR\_IA32\_TSC\_DEADLINE set to 0, Firecracker will replace it with the MSR\_IA32\_TSC value from the same vCPU. This is to guarantee that the vCPU will continue receiving TSC interrupts after restoring from the snapshot even if an interrupt is lost when taking a snapshot.
* [#4666](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4666): Fixed Firecracker sometimes restoring `MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE` before `MSR_IA32_TSC`. Now it always restores `MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE` MSR after `MSR_IA32_TSC`, as KVM relies on the guest TSC for correct restoration of `MSR_IA32_TSC_DEADLINE`. This fixed guests using the `TSC_DEADLINE` hardware feature receiving incorrect timer interrupts after snapshot restoration, which could lead to them seemingly getting stuck in sleep-related syscalls (see also [#4099](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/4099)).

[Firecracker v1.7.0](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/tag/v1.7.0)

### Added

* [#4346](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4346): Added support to emit aggregate (minimum/maximum/sum) latency for `VcpuExit::MmioRead`, `VcpuExit::MmioWrite`, `VcpuExit::IoIn` and `VcpuExit::IoOut`. The average for these VM exits is not emitted since it can be deduced from the available emitted metrics.
* [#4360](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4360): Added dev-preview support for backing a VM's guest memory by 2M hugetlbfs pages. Please see the [documentation](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.7.0/docs/hugepages.md) for more information
* [#4490](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4490): Added block and net device metrics for file/tap access latencies and queue backlog lengths, which can be used to analyse saturation of the Firecracker VMM thread and underlying layers. Queue backlog length metrics are flushed periodically. They can be used to esimtate an average queue length by request by dividing its value by the number of requests served.

### Changed

* [#4230](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4230): Changed microVM snapshot format version strategy. Firecracker snapshot format now has a version that is independent of Firecracker version. The current version of the snapshot format is v1.0.0. From now on, the Firecracker binary will define the snapshot format version it supports and it will only be able to load snapshots with format that is backwards compatible with that version. Users can pass the `--snapshot-version` flag to the Firecracker binary to see its supported snapshot version format. This change renders all previous Firecracker snapshots (up to Firecracker version v1.6.0) incompatible with the current Firecracker version.
* [#4449](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4449): Added information about page size to the payload Firecracker sends to the UFFD handler. Each memory region object now contains a `page_size_kib` field. See also the [hugepages documentation](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.7.0/docs/hugepages.md).
* [#4501](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4501): Only use memfd to back guest memory if a vhost-user-blk device is configured, otherwise use anonymous private memory. This is because serving page faults of shared memory used by memfd is slower and may impact workloads.

### Fixed

* [#4409](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4409): Fixed a bug in the cpu-template-helper that made it panic during conversion of cpu configuration with SVE registers to the cpu template on aarch64 platform. Now cpu-template-helper will print warnings if it encounters SVE registers during the conversion process. This is because cpu templates are limited to only modify registers less than 128 bits.
* [#4413](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4413): Fixed a bug in the Firecracker that prevented it to restore snapshots of VMs that had SVE enabled.
* [#4414](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4360): Made `PATCH` requests to the `/machine-config` endpoint transactional, meaning Firecracker's configuration will be unchanged if the request returns an error. This fixes a bug where a microVM with incompatible balloon and guest memory size could be booted, due to the check for this condition happening after Firecracker's configuration was updated.
* [#4259](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4259): Added a double fork mechanism in the Jailer to avoid setsid() failures occurred while running Jailer as the process group leader. However, this changed the behaviour of Jailer and now the Firecracker process will always have a different PID than the Jailer process.
* [#4436](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4436): Added a "Known Limitations" section in the Jailer docs to highlight the above change in behaviour introduced in PR#4259.
* [#4442](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4442): As a solution to the change in behaviour introduced in PR#4259, provided a mechanism to reliably fetch Firecracker PID. With this change, Firecracker process's PID will always be available in the Jailer's root directory regardless of whether new\_pid\_ns was set.
* [#4468](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4468): Fixed a bug where a client would hang or timeout when querying for an MMDS path whose content is empty, because the 'Content-Length' header field was missing in a response.

[Firecracker v1.6.0](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

### Added

* [#4145](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4145): Added support for per net device metrics. In addition to aggregate metrics `net`, each individual net device will emit metrics under the label `"net_{iface_id}"`. E.g. the associated metrics for the endpoint `"/network-interfaces/eth0"` will be available under `"net_eth0"` in the metrics json object.
* [#4202](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4202): Added support for per block device metrics. In addition to aggregate metrics `block`, each individual block device will emit metrics under the label `"block_{drive_id}"`. E.g. the associated metrics for the endpoint `"/drives/{drive_id}"` will be available under `"block_drive_id"` in the metrics json object.
* [#4205](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4205): Added a new `vm-state` subcommand to `info-vmstate` command in the `snapshot-editor` tool to print MicrovmState of vmstate snapshot file in a readable format. Also made the `vcpu-states` subcommand available on x86\_64.
* [#4063](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4063): Added source-level instrumentation based tracing. See [tracing](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.6.0/docs/tracing.md) for more details.
* [#4138](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4138), [#4170](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4170), [#4223](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4223), [#4247](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4247), [#4226](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4226): Added **developer preview only** (NOT for production use) support for vhost-user block devices. Firecracker implements a vhost-user frontend. Users are free to choose from existing open source backend solutions or their own implementation. Known limitation: snapshotting is not currently supported for microVMs containing vhost-user block devices. See the [related doc page](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.6.0/docs/api_requests/block-vhost-user.md) for details. The device emits metrics under the label `"vhost_user_{device}_{drive_id}"`.

### Changed

* [#4309](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4309): The jailer’s option `--parent-cgroup` will move the process to that cgroup if no `cgroup` options are provided.
* Simplified and clarified the removal policy of deprecated API elements to follow semantic versioning 2.0.0. For more information, please refer to [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/discussions/4135).
* [#4180](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4180): Refactored error propagation to avoid logging and printing an error on exits with a zero exit code. Now, on successful exit “Firecracker exited successfully” is logged.
* [#4194](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4194): Removed support for creating Firecracker snapshots targeting older versions of Firecracker. With this change, running ‘firecracker –version’ will not print the supported snapshot versions.
* [#4301](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4301): Allow merging of diff snapshots into base snapshots by directly writing the diff snapshot on top of the base snapshot’s memory file. This can be done by setting the `mem_file_path` to the path of the pre-existing full snapshot.

### Deprecated

* [#4209](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4209): `rebase-snap` tool is now deprecated. Users should use `snapshot-editor` for rebasing diff snapshots.

### Fixed

* [#4171](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4171): Fixed a bug that ignored the `--show-log-origin` option, preventing it from printing the source code file of the log messages.
* [#4178](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4178): Fixed a bug reporting a non-zero exit code on successful shutdown when starting Firecracker with `--no-api`.
* [#4261](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4261): Fixed a bug where Firecracker would log “RunWithApiError error: MicroVMStopped without an error: GenericError” when exiting after encountering an emulation error. It now correctly prints “RunWithApiError error: MicroVMStopped *with* an error: GenericError”.
* [#4242](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4242): Fixed a bug introduced in [#4047](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4047) that limited the `--level` option of logger to Pascal-cased values (e.g. accepting “Info”, but not “info”). It now ignores case again.
* [#4286](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4286): Fixed a bug in the asynchronous virtio-block engine that rendered the device non-functional after a PATCH request was issued to Firecracker for updating the path to the host-side backing file of the device.
* [#4301](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4301): Fixed a bug where if Firecracker was instructed to take a snapshot of a microvm which itself was restored from a snapshot, specifying `mem_file_path` to be the path of the memory file from which the microvm was restored would result in both the microvm and the snapshot being corrupted. It now instead performs a “write-back” of all memory that was updated since the snapshot was originally loaded.

[Firecracker v1.5.0](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

### Added

* [#3837](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/issues/3837): Added official support for Linux 6.1. See [prod-host-setup](/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.5.0/docs/prod-host-setup.md) for some security and performance considerations.
* [#4045](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4045) and [#4075](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/4075): Added `snapshot-editor` tool for modifications of snapshot files. It allows for rebasing of memory snapshot files, printing and removing aarch64 registers from the vmstate and obtaining snapshot version.
* [#3967](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/pull/3967/): Added new fields to the custom CPU templates. (aarch64 only) `vcpu_features` field allows modifications of vCPU features enabled during vCPU initialization. `kvm_capabilities` field allows modifications of KVM capability checks that Firecracker performs during boot. If any of these fields are in use, minimal target snapshot version is restricted to 1.5.

### Changed

* Updated deserialization of `bitmap` for custom CPU templates to allow usage of '\_' as a separator.
* Changed the strip feature of `cpu-template-helper` tool to operate bitwise.
* Better logs during validation of CPU ID in snapshot restoration path. Also Firecracker now does not fail if it can't get CPU ID from the host or can't find CPU ID in the snapshot.
* Changed the serial device to only try to initialize itself if stdin is a terminal or a FIFO pipe. This fixes logged warnings about the serial device failing to initialize if the process is daemonized (in which case stdin is /dev/null instead of a terminal).
* Changed to show a warning message when launching a microVM with C3 template on a processor prior to Intel Cascade Lake, because the guest kernel does not apply the mitigation against MMIO stale data vulnerability when it is running on a processor that does not enumerate FBSDP\_NO, PSDP\_NO and SBDR\_SSDP\_NO on IA32\_ARCH\_CAPABILITIES MSR.
* Made Firecracker resize its file descriptor table on process start. It now preallocates the in-kernel fdtable to hold `RLIMIT_NOFILE` many fds (or 2048 if no limit is set). This avoids the kernel reallocating the fdtable during Firecracker operations, resulting in a 30ms to 70ms reduction of snapshot restore times for medium to large microVMs with many devices attached.
* Changed the dump feature of `cpu-template-helper` tool not to enumerate program counter (PC) on ARM because it is determined by the given kernel image and it is useless in the custom CPU template context.
* The ability to create snapshots for an older version of Firecracker is now deprecated. As a result, the `version` body field in `PUT` on `/snapshot/create` request in deprecated.
* Added support for the /dev/userfaultfd device available on linux kernels >= 6.1. This is the default for creating UFFD handlers on these kernel versions. If it is unavailable, Firecracker falls back to the userfaultfd syscall.
* Deprecated `cpu_template` field in `PUT` and `PATCH` requests on `/machine-config` API, which is used to set a static CPU template. Custom CPU templates added in v1.4.0 are available as an improved iteration of the static CPU templates. For more information about the transition from static CPU templates to custom CPU templates, please refer to [this GitHub discussion](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/discussions/4135).
* Changed default log level from [`Warn`](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/enum.Level.html#variant.Warn) to [`Info`](https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/enum.Level.html#variant.Info). This results in more logs being output by default.

### Fixed

* Fixed a change in behavior of normalize host brand string that breaks Firecracker on external instances.
* Fixed the T2A CPU template not to unset the MMX bit (CPUID.80000001h:EDX[23]) and the FXSR bit (CPUID.80000001h:EDX[24]).
* Fixed the T2A CPU template to set the RstrFpErrPtrs bit (CPUID.80000008h:EBX[2]).
* Fixed a bug where Firecracker would crash during boot if a guest set up a virtio queue that partially overlapped with the MMIO gap. Now Firecracker instead correctly refuses to activate the corresponding virtio device.
* Fixed the T2CL CPU template to pass through security mitigation bits that are listed by KVM as bits able to be passed through. By making the most use of the available hardware security mitigations on a processor that a guest is running on, the guest might be able to benefit from performance improvements.
* Fixed the T2S CPU template to set the GDS\_NO bit of the IA32\_ARCH\_CAPABILITIES MSR to 1 in accordance with an Intel microcode update. To use the template securely, users should apply the latest microcode update on the host.
* Fixed the spelling of the `nomodule` param passed in the default kernel command line parameters. This is a **breaking change** for setups that use the default kernel command line which also depend on being able to load kernel modules at runtime. This may also break setups which use the default kernel command line and which use an init binary that inadvertently depends on the misspelled param ("nomodules") being present at the command line, since this param will no longer be passed.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/).

If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved.

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

**Short version:** *We use email and other electronic means to stay in touch with our users.*

### [1. Electronic Communication Required](#1-electronic-communication-required)

For contractual purposes, you (1) consent to receive communications from us in an electronic form via the email address you have submitted or via the Service; and (2) agree that all Terms of Service, agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that those communications would satisfy if they were on paper. This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

Communications made through email or GitHub Support's messaging system will not constitute legal notice to GitHub or any of its officers, employees, agents or representatives in any situation where notice to GitHub is required by contract or any law or regulation. Legal notice to GitHub must be in writing and [served on GitHub's legal agent](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/guidelines-for-legal-requests-of-user-data#submitting-requests).

### [3. No Phone Support](#3-no-phone-support)

GitHub only offers support via email, in-Service communications, and electronic messages. We do not offer telephone support.

## [N. Disclaimer of Warranties](#n-disclaimer-of-warranties)

**Short version:** *We provide our service as is, and we make no promises or guarantees about this service. Please read this section carefully; you should understand what to expect.*

GitHub provides the Website and the Service “as is” and “as available,” without warranty of any kind. Without limiting this, we expressly disclaim all warranties, whether express, implied or statutory, regarding the Website and the Service including without limitation any warranty of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, security, accuracy and non-infringement.

GitHub does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements; that the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; that the information provided through the Service is accurate, reliable or correct; that any defects or errors will be corrected; that the Service will be available at any particular time or location; or that the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components. You assume full responsibility and risk of loss resulting from your downloading and/or use of files, information, content or other material obtained from the Service.

## [O. Limitation of Liability](#o-limitation-of-liability)

**Short version:** *We will not be liable for damages or losses arising from your use or inability to use the service or otherwise arising under this agreement. Please read this section carefully; it limits our obligations to you.*

You understand and agree that we will not be liable to you or any third party for any loss of profits, use, goodwill, or data, or for any incidental, indirect, special, consequential or exemplary damages, however arising, that result from

* the use, disclosure, or display of your User-Generated Content;
* your use or inability to use the Service;
* any modification, price change, suspension or discontinuance of the Service;
* the Service generally or the software or systems that make the Service available;
* unauthorized access to or alterations of your transmissions or data;
* statements or conduct of any third party on the Service;
* any other user interactions that you input or receive through your use of the Service; or
* any other matter relating to the Service.

Our liability is limited whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damages, and even if a remedy set forth in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose. We will have no liability for any failure or delay due to matters beyond our reasonable control.

## [P. Release and Indemnification](#p-release-and-indemnification)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for your use of the service. If you harm someone else or get into a dispute with someone else, we will not be involved.*

If you have a dispute with one or more Users, you agree to release GitHub from any and all claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments. We will notify our Users of material changes to this Agreement, such as price increases, at least 30 days prior to the change taking effect by posting a notice on our Website or sending email to the primary email address specified in your GitHub account. Customer's continued use of the Service after those 30 days constitutes agreement to those revisions of this Agreement. For any other modifications, your continued use of the Website constitutes agreement to our revisions of these Terms of Service. You can view all changes to these Terms in our [Site Policy](https://github.com/github/site-policy) repository.

We reserve the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Website (or any part of it) with or without notice.
