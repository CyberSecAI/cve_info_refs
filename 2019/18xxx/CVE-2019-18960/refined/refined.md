  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2019-18960",
    "description": "Firecracker v0.18.0 and v0.19.0 are affected by a vsock buffer overflow. A logical error in bounds checking performed on vsock virtio descriptors can be used by a malicious guest to read from and write to a segment of the host-side Firecracker process' heap address space, directly after the end of a guest memory region.",
    "affected_systems": [
      "Firecracker v0.18.0",
      "Firecracker v0.19.0",
      "Firecracker microVMs with configured vsock devices in active use by both host and guest"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A logical error in bounds checking performed on vsock virtio descriptors.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious guest can exploit the bounds checking error in vsock virtio descriptors.",
    "impact": "A malicious guest can read from and write to a segment of the host-side Firecracker process' heap address space, directly after the end of a guest memory region. For reads, the accessible segment's size is 64 KiB. For writes, the accessible segment is limited by the host Linux kernel to a size defined in /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max. This can result in a segmentation fault, and remote code execution within the Firecracker host-side process context cannot be ruled out.",
    "mitigation": "Patched binaries have been released as Firecracker v0.18.1 and Firecracker v0.19.1. Users are advised to update to these versions.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Malicious guest OS within the Firecracker microVM.",
    "additional_mitigation": "Users running Firecracker in line with the recommended Production Host Setup will see the impact limited as follows: a malicious microVM guest that would manage to compromise the Firecracker VMM process would be restricted to running on the host as an unprivileged user, in a chroot and mount namespace isolated from the host's filesystem, in a separate pid namespace, in a separate network namespace, with system calls limited to Firecracker's seccomp whitelist, on a single NUMA node, and on a cgroups-limited number of CPU cores."
