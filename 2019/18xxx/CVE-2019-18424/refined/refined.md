Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Xen handles PCI passthrough devices, specifically concerning DMA (Direct Memory Access) and IOMMU (Input-Output Memory Management Unit) protection. When a PCI device is assigned to an untrusted guest domain, it can be programmed to perform DMA to arbitrary memory locations. While the IOMMU is meant to restrict DMA to only the guest's assigned memory, a problem occurs when the guest domain is terminated or the device is deassigned, and then reassigned to dom0. At this point any DMA in progress from the device can target critical host (dom0) memory instead of the memory allocated to the (now removed) guest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insufficient DMA Protection Post-Deassignment:** The core issue is that Xen does not properly quarantine or halt DMA transfers from a PCI device when that device is deassigned from a guest and reassigned to dom0.
2.  **Privilege Escalation via DMA:** A malicious guest can use a passed through PCI device to DMA to any host memory, circumventing memory protections and leading to privilege escalation.
3. **Missing HVM check** The IOMMU code lacked checks specific to HVM guests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A compromised guest can gain control over the host operating system by performing DMA into host memory, allowing for privilege escalation to the hypervisor level.
*   **Data Corruption:** Malicious DMA can also lead to corruption of sensitive data within the host memory space.
*   **System Instability:** Corrupting critical parts of host memory can cause system instability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **PCI Passthrough:** The attack requires a system that supports and uses PCI passthrough, allowing a guest to have direct access to a physical PCI device.
*   **Malicious Guest:** The attacker is a malicious guest operating in a virtual machine that has a device passed through.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to PCI Device:** An attacker must control a guest VM that is configured to have direct access to a physical PCI device,
*   **Ability to Program DMA:** The attacker must be able to control the device and be able to program it to perform DMA.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs the ability to time deassignment or tear down of the guest after programming the device to perform the DMA.

**Additional details**
*  ARM systems are not affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation**

Use of PCI passthrough should be replaced with higher-level protocols like Xen PV block or network devices when possible.

**Resolution:**

The issue is resolved by applying patches that:

*   Quarantine PCI devices when a guest is destroyed.
* Add missing HVM check in the IOMMU code.

The patches are available for various Xen versions, including unstable, 4.12.x, 4.11.x, 4.10.x, and 4.9.x. It's important to use the correct patch version for the specific version of Xen being used, as they are known to break on ARM systems. The patches add extra check to prevent use with HVM guest, which is not affected by the bug.
