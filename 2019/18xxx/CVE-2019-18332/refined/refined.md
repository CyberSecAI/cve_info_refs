- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An attacker can gain access to directory listings of the server by sending specially crafted packets to specific TCP ports (80/tcp, 8095/tcp or 8080/tcp).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information, specifically directory listings, due to improper handling of requests.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker can gain access to directory listings on the server. This can lead to further information disclosure and could aid in other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access is required to send specially crafted packets to the specified ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the Application Server to send the malicious packets.
