Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-18890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw found in Redmine, a project management web application. This means that an attacker can manipulate SQL queries to gain unauthorized access to the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries. This occurs due to a lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Protected Information:** A successful exploit allows attackers to bypass security restrictions and access protected information stored in the database.
*   The vulnerability could lead to the retrieval of sensitive data or modification of the database content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted object query. This likely means that a user can send a malicious query to the application. The vulnerable component is related to handling of objects and project queries
*   The specific vector involves manipulating the `project.id` parameter
*   The exploit.py script in one of the GitHub repositories provides a proof-of-concept (POC)
*   REST API needs to be enabled, and access credentials are required, suggesting that the injection occurs in authenticated part of the application.
*   Subprojects are required

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** Attackers require valid access credentials to the Redmine application. This indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable by unauthenticated users.
*   **Subproject Access:** It appears the attacker needs to be in a context of a subproject
*   **API Access**: The REST API needs to be enabled.
*   **Knowledge of the application's API or query structure**: It is necessary for the attacker to formulate a malicious query.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Redmine versions up to 3.2.9 and 3.3.x before 3.3.10
*   The fix involves updating the application to version 3.3.10 or higher.
*   The vulnerability has a "Moderate" severity, as per the Debian Security Advisory.
*   A fix was also issued for Ubuntu 19.04, 18.04 ESM and 16.04 ESM versions.
*   This vulnerability was discovered by Hoger Just.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-18890 is an SQL injection vulnerability in Redmine that allows authenticated users to potentially access protected information through a crafted query. The vulnerability requires user authentication and a subproject to be present. Patches are available for affected versions, and upgrading is advised.
