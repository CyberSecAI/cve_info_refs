Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18340:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Both the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server and the Control Center Server (CCS) store user and device passwords using weak cryptographic algorithms.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of a broken or risky cryptographic algorithm (CWE-327) for storing passwords. This implies that the encryption or hashing method used is easily reversible or crackable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker can extract passwords from the user database and/or device configuration files.
- This can lead to further attacks by allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system or related devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the server is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where either SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server or the Control Center Server (CCS) is installed.
- The attacker needs to have low privileges on the local system.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability affects both SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server and Control Center Server (CCS).
- No fix is currently planned for versions of CCS >=V1.5.0 or SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server >= V5.0.0.
- Mitigation includes hardening the server to prevent local access by unauthorized users.
