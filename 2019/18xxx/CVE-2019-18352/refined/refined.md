- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper access control in PHOENIX CONTACT FL NAT 2xxx devices when using MAC-based or 802.1x port security.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device improperly grants access to unauthorized devices when routing between subnets if MAC-based or 802.1x port security is enabled.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthorized device can access other devices on a different subnet. However, the unauthorized device cannot access the authorized device that is directly connected to the port with security enabled.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthorized device connected to the same subnet as a port with enabled MAC-based or 802.1x security can access another subnet via the FL NAT 2xxx if it is routing between those subnets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same subnet as a port on the FL NAT device with port security enabled. The FL NAT device must be routing between the attacker's subnet and a separate target subnet.
