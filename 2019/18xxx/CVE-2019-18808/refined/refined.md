    "Official Description": "A memory leak in the ccp_run_sha_cmd() function in drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.9 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-128c66429247.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `ccp_run_sha_cmd()` function in the AMD Cryptographic Coprocessor (CCP) driver fails to release allocated memory when an invalid SHA type command is encountered.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service due to memory exhaustion.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local attacker able to send invalid SHA type commands can trigger the memory leak.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access is required to trigger the vulnerability."
