- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Unauthenticated SQL injection vulnerability exists in the Online Grading System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands through various parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification of data, or complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the `student`, `instructor`, `department`, `room`, `class`, and `user` modules, manipulating the `id` and `classId` parameters with SQL injection payloads.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need authentication and can exploit the vulnerability remotely over the network.
