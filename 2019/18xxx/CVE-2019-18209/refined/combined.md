```
Added pad_utils sanitization for clean and safe error handling on browsers that
do not encode the path of the URL.

Edited by muxator based on [#3647](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/pull/3647),
to be able to apply the patch on develop (the PR was for master), and perform
minor cleanups (mainly spurious statements).

Closes [#3647](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/pull/3647).
