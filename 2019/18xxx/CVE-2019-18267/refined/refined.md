- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, the GE S2020/S2020G Fast Switch 61850 is vulnerable to both reflected and stored cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, both reflected and stored.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the HTTP response. This can lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Disclosure of sensitive data
    - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks
    - Remote code execution
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Specially crafted HTTP requests to inject malicious JavaScript that is then reflected in the HTTP response.
    - Stored XSS where injected scripts are persistently stored on the device and executed when other users interact with affected parts of the web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable with a low skill level required to execute. The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device.
