The provided content describes a vulnerability dubbed #AVGater, which allows local privilege escalation by abusing the anti-virus quarantine restore feature. This vulnerability is not related to CVE-2019-18194.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability of a non-privileged user to manipulate the restore process of quarantined files by abusing NTFS directory junctions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Privileged File Write Vulnerability:** The anti-virus service, running with SYSTEM privileges, restores files from quarantine. This process can be manipulated to write files to arbitrary locations, bypassing file system access control lists (ACLs).
*   **NTFS Directory Junction Abuse:** A non-privileged user can create NTFS directory junctions, which are symbolic links for directories. These junctions can redirect the restore path to arbitrary locations.
*   **DLL Side Loading:** By writing a malicious DLL to a location where a privileged Windows process will load it, an attacker can achieve code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local non-admin user can gain full control over the affected endpoint by executing arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  The attacker moves a malicious DLL to the anti-virus quarantine.
2.  The attacker creates an NTFS directory junction that redirects the original source path of the quarantined file to a destination folder (e.g., within "C:\Program Files" or "C:\Windows").
3.  The attacker initiates the restore of the quarantined file using the anti-virus user interface.
4.  The anti-virus service, running as SYSTEM, writes the malicious DLL to the manipulated destination.
5.  A privileged Windows process loads the malicious DLL, leading to arbitrary code execution within the DLLMain entry point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Local access to the system.
*   Ability to create NTFS directory junctions (mklink).
*   Ability to interact with the anti-virus user interface to restore files from quarantine.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is not specific to one anti-virus product but affects multiple solutions that use a similar quarantine and restore mechanism.
*   The blog post mentions specific examples of local privilege escalation in Emsisoft Anti-Malware and Malwarebytes 3 by abusing the #AVGater vulnerability.
*   The recommended mitigation is to install updates promptly and restrict normal users from restoring quarantined files in corporate environments.
