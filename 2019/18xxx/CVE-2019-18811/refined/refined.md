{
  "CVE-2019-18811": {
    "Description": "A memory leak in the `sof_set_get_large_ctrl_data()` function in `sound/soc/sof/ipc.c` in the Linux kernel allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering `sof_get_ctrl_copy_params()` failures.",
    "Root cause": "The Sound Open Firmware (SOF) driver in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to improper deallocation."
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion), potentially leading to system crash.",
     "Attack vectors": "A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by triggering a specific error condition in the SOF driver.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Local access to the system is required to trigger the vulnerability."
  }
