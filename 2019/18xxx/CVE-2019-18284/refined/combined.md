LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.

SSA-451445: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SPPA-T3000

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

2019-12-10
2022-02-17
V1.2

SUMMARY

SPPA-T3000 Application Server and MS3000 Migration Server are affected by multiple vulnerabilities.
Some of the vulnerabilities can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. Exploitation of
the vulnerabilities described in this advisory requires access to either Application- or Automation Highway.
Both highways should not be exposed if the environment has been set up according to the recommended
system conﬁguration in the SPPA-T3000 security manual.

In this case Siemens Energy considers the environmental score as CR:L/IR:L/AR:H/MAV:A for vulner-
abilities related to the Application Server and CR:L/IR:L/AR:M/MAV:A for vulnerabilities related to the
Migration Server.

Siemens Energy provides a service pack to ﬁx vulnerabilities on the Application Server and recommends
conﬁgurations to mitigate the vulnerabilities in the Migration Server. Detailed information will be available
for SPPA-T3000 customers in the Siemens Energy Customer Portal (https://cep.siemens-energy.com/).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Implement mitigations described in the SPPA-T3000 security manual

• Restrict access to the Application Highway using the SPPA-T3000 Firewall

• External components should be connected only to the SPPA-T3000 DMZ; no bridging of an external

network to either the Application- or Automation highways is allowed

• Perform regular updates of the SPPA-T3000 (e.g. by using the Security Server if available)

• Implement mitigations provided in the customer information letter distributed via the customer

service portal

• Please contact your local Siemens Energy representative if you need help at securing your SPPA-

T3000 installation

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens Energy strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding
tooling and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an
automated means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens
Energy strongly recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision
by trained staff of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens Energy strongly recommends to protect network access with
appropriate mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment
according to our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SPPA-T3000 is a distributed control system mostly used in fossil and large scale renewable power plants.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
