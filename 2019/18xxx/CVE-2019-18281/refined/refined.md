Based on the provided information, here's what I've extracted regarding CVE-2019-18281:

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds memory access.
*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect handling of text files containing many directional characters in the Qt library.
*   **Attack Vector:** Opening a specially crafted text file. This could occur through various means, such as a crafted email to a KMail recipient or opening a malicious file via any Qt-based application.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash).
*   **Affected Versions:** The Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4556-1) indicates that the stable distribution (buster) was affected, and the problem was fixed in version `5.11.3+dfsg1-1+deb10u1`. The Ubuntu bug report indicates the issue affected Qt versions prior to 5.12.5.
*   **Unaffected Versions:** Debian stretch is not affected. Ubuntu Bionic is not affected as it doesn't contain the original vulnerability. Focal has Qt 5.12.5 where this is fixed.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by backporting a patch (likely from the Qt project - reference to `https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/271889`).
*   **Affected systems:** Debian Buster, Ubuntu 19.10.

The information also shows the resolution in Ubuntu 19.10 (Eoan): `libqt5core5a` and `libqt5gui5` were updated to version `5.12.4+dfsg-4ubuntu1.1`. Disco was affected, but reached end of life before a fix was issued.

The Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202003-60 indicates `dev-qt/qtcore` versions less than `5.13.2-r2` are affected, and unaffected versions are revision greater or equal to `5.12.3-r2` and revision greater or equal to `5.13.2-r2`.
