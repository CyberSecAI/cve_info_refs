# [CVE-2019-18635] Moolticute: a NULL-pointer dereference

Posted on [27.10.201902.05.2021](https://securiteam.io/2019/10/27/a-null-pointer-dereference/) by [Shadi Habbal](https://securiteam.io/author/kerpanic/)

I started ticking differently after taking on the [Corelan Advanced Win32 Exploit Development](https://www.corelan-training.com/index.php/training/advanced/) training last month at [BruCON 0x0B](https://www.brucon.org/2019/brucon-2019-training/). I am very delighted and excited about that, and looking forward to putting the new experience to more practical use.

### A NULL-pointer dereference

According to Wikipedia[Â¹](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Null_Dereference#Description):

> The program can potentially dereference a null pointer, thereby raising a NullPointerException. Null pointer errors are usually the result of one or more programmer assumptions being violated. Most null pointer issues result in general software reliability problems, but if an attacker can intentionally trigger a null pointer dereference, the attacker might be able to use the resulting exception to bypass security logic or to cause the application to reveal debugging information that will be valuable in planning subsequent attacks.
>
> A null-pointer dereference takes place when a pointer with a value of NULL is used as though it pointed to a valid memory area.
>
> Null-pointer dereferences, while common, can generally be found and corrected in a simple way. They will always result in the crash of the process, unless exception handling (on some platforms) is invoked, and even then, little can be done to salvage the process.

### A vulnerable code

The following code was taken from an application that I am currently inspecting. The name of the application and references to the code will not be released for the time being. The code is very common in applications that want to enumerate available USB interfaces each time they change, due to a new USB device being plugged-in or unplugged.

```

dev_detail_data = (SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA_A*) malloc(required_size);
dev_detail_data->cbSize = sizeof(SP_DEVICE_INTERFACE_DETAIL_DATA_A);

```

Do you see it, my lovely little NULL-pointer dereference <3 ?

On line #1, memory of size *required\_size* is being allocated and on a successful allocation, a pointer to the allocated memory chunk of type *SP\_DEVICE\_INTERFACE\_DETAIL\_DATA\_A* is returned and stored in *dev\_detail\_data*.

On line #2, the size of the datatype *SP\_DEVICE\_INTERFACE\_DETAIL\_DATA\_A* is calculated and stored at the corresponding address, that is referenced by the pointer we got from line #1.

But what would happen if the allocation fails, i.e. *malloc()* was unable to allocate the *required\_size*? According to the documentation[Â²](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/malloc/), it would then return a NULL pointer.

> On success, a pointer to the memory block allocated by the function.
>
> The type of this pointer is always `void*`, which can be cast to the desired type of data pointer in order to be dereferenceable.
>
> If the function failed to allocate the requested block of memory, a *null pointer* is returned.

That means, if we can force *malloc()* to fail, we would be able to force the application to assign a value to a dereferenced NULL-pointer on line #2 ð

### Exploitability

In userland, this is hardly exploitable and highly dependant on the application’s code, however when running in kernel-mode, it’s a different story.

Exploiting this **effectively** requires running the vulnerable code in kernel-mode & being able to force *malloc()* to fail, by:

* being able to exhaust the free available memory, or
* being able to control the value of *required\_size* to set it to an arbitrary large value.

### Mitigation

Mitigating this is easy. It should not be taken for granted that *malloc()* would return a valid pointer to a memory chunk, therefore it is sufficient to compare the returned value of the pointer to NULL.

### TL;DR

A NULL-pointer dereference occurs when an application uses a NULL-pointer **unintentionally** to read or write from/to a memory address referenced by the pointer. This happens when the pointer has been nullified or when it wasn’t assigned correctly in the first place.
