{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-ID": "CVE-2019-18635",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing check for a NULL pointer after a call to `malloc()`. If `malloc()` fails to allocate memory, it returns a NULL pointer. The code then attempts to dereference this NULL pointer, resulting in a crash.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact": "The application crashes due to the NULL pointer dereference. In a kernel-mode context, this could potentially lead to more severe consequences, though this is not specifically detailed.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when `malloc()` fails to allocate memory. This can be achieved by exhausting available memory or by controlling the allocation size to an arbitrary large value, making the allocation fail.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to either exhaust the available memory or control the value of the allocation size such that the malloc call fails. The specific mechanism to achieve this is application-dependent but may include sending specially crafted input or performing operations that consume system resources.",
  "Additional details": "The vulnerable code was found in an application that enumerates available USB interfaces. The code allocates memory for device interface details using malloc, and if malloc fails the returned null pointer is dereferenced causing a crash. The vulnerability was discovered in Moolticute, a component of the Mooltipass hardware password manager. The issue was addressed by adding a null check after the malloc call."
