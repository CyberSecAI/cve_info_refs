Package        : condor
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18823 CVE-2022-26110
Debian Bug     : 963777 1008634

Several flaws have been discovered in HTCondor, a distributed workload
management system, which allow users with only READ access to any daemon to use
a different authentication method than the administrator has specified. If the
administrator has configured the READ or WRITE methods to include CLAIMTOBE,
then it is possible to impersonate another user and submit or remove jobs.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.6.8~dfsg.1-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your condor packages.

For the detailed security status of condor please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/condor>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

# HTCONDOR-2020-0001

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| A piece of secret information is written in the clear to the STARTD\_HISTORY file. An attacker could use this secret information to control the slot of another user, including running their own code as that user. [CVE-2019-18823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18823) | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | condor\_startd | All before 8.8.8 (stable) and 8.9.6 (devel) | all | not known to be publicly exploited | 8.8.8, 8.9.6 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | login access to an execute machine or the ability to submit a job | execute hosts that are not configured to use authentication or use match password authentication | high | high | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2020-03-01 | Todd Tannenbaum | | |
| Access Required: |  |
| Be able to read a world-readable file on an execute machine. Even if a user does not have login access to the execute machine, the attacker can submit a job and that job can then look at the STARTD\_HISTORY on the machine where it executes. Execute machines configured to require a strong credential-based authentication method (e.g. authentication method such as pool password, SSL, Kerberos, GSI, or TOKEN) and have match password authentication disabled are not vulnerable. | |
| Effort Required: | high |
| A thorough understanding of the HTCondor code and the ability to write custom tools is required to exploit this vulnerability. Also, the pool must be using host-based authorization or have match password authentication enabled (the default) to be vulnerable. If authentication has been set up for the pool and match password authentication is disabled, the attacker would also need to gain access to the condor credentials. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | high |
| Using the secret information, they could then manipulate another user's running job, including evicting that job or replacing that job with one that executes the attacker's own code. This could possibly allow the attacker to get access to the user's job data files which may contain sensitive information. Pools that are not configured to use daemon-to-daemon authentication or have match password authentication enabled (the default) are vulnerable. | |
| Workaround: |
| Disable STARTD\_HISTORY, which is on by default. You can do this by adding "STARTD\_HISTORY=" in your condor\_config file. Alternatively, the administrator can configure authentication for daemon-to-daemon communications and disable match password authentication. To disable match password authentication, add "SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION=False" to your condor\_config file. See the security section of the manual for more information about configuring daemon-to-daemon authentication. Be advised that disabling match password authentication can put significant extra load on the submit machines of a large pool (thousands of nodes). After installing updated binaries or working around the issue, you should restart HTCondor. The secret written to the log will no longer be relevant and you do not need to scrub or delete the log. | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |

### HTCondor

HTCondor provides you with the ability to effectively utilize all the computing resources at your disposal.

HTCondor is a software system that creates a High-Throughput Computing (HTC) environment. It
effectively uses the computing power of machines connected over a network, be they a single
cluster, a set of clusters on a campus, cloud resources either standalone or temporarily
joined to a local cluster, or international grids. Power comes from the ability to effectively
harness shared resources with distributed ownership.

[Learn More About HTCondor](/htcondor/htcondor/overview)

### HTCondor-CE

The entry point to remote computing resources.

The HTCondor-CE software is a *Compute Entrypoint* (CE) based on [HTCondor](http://htcondor.org) for sites
that are part of a larger computing grid
(e.g. [European Grid Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/), [Open Science Grid](https://opensciencegrid.org/)).
As such, HTCondor-CE serves as a "door" for incoming resource allocation requests (RARs) 칙춦 it handles authorization and
delegation of these requests to a grid site's local batch system.
Supported batch systems include
[Grid Engine](http://www.univa.com/products/),
[HTCondor](http://htcondor.org),
[LSF](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/hpc-workload-management),
[PBS Pro](https://www.altair.com/pbs-professional/)/[Torque](https://adaptivecomputing.com/cherry-services/torque-resource-manager/),

HTCondor Software Suite (HTCSS) provides an array of services for automating
and managing batch workloads and computing resources.

# HTCONDOR-2020-0004

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| On Windows, the condor\_shadow will send a user's password to anyone who can present credentials that authenticate them as the condor service. As a result of this, if you have a mixed pool consisting of Windows submit machines and Linux execute hosts, the Linux condor\_starter will write the user's Windows password into a file on the execute machine (which requires root access to read). [CVE-2019-18823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18823) | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | condor\_shadow | All before 8.8.8 (stable) and 8.9.6 (devel) | Windows | not known to be publicly exploited | 8.8.8, 8.9.6 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | can authenticate to the condor\_shadow as the condor service | any host | high | high | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2020-03-01 | TJ Knoeller | | |
| Access Required: |  |
| If an attacker were able to gain access to the credentials used to authenticate the condor daemons, and has network access to a submit machine, they could use those credentials to query the condor\_shadow running a job on a Windows machine to obtain a user's password (if the user has stored their password using condor\_store\_cred). | |
| Effort Required: | high |
| A thorough understanding of the HTCondor code and the ability to write custom tools is required to exploit this vulnerability, plus the need to have access to the condor daemon's credentials. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | high |
| Users' passwords can be obtained by someone with access to the condor credentials. This also means that in a mixed Windows/Linux pool, the Linux condor\_starter (which has condor credentials) can fetch the user's password from a Windows submit machine and then writes the unencrypted password to a file. However, this file is only readable by root and is deleted when the job completes. | |
| Workaround: |
| None | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |

URL : <http://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/>
Summary : HTCondor: High Throughput Computing
Description :
HTCondor is a workload management system for high-throughput and
high-performance jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor
provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their
serial or parallel jobs to HTCondor, HTCondor places them into a queue,
chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully
monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon
completion.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them  but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1822525#c0)  Bert DeKnuydt    2020-04-09 09:14:25 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  As per <https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/>, stable Condor versions older than 8.8.8 suffer from some security problems.  The versions provided by Fedora are way older than that. (and lack some normal bugfixes and useful features too)  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  condor-8.8.4-1.fc31  How reproducible:  Not applicable  Additional info:  If anyone is interested (and trusts me), I have a source rpm for  Fedora 31 for condor-8.8.8-1.  Willing to build for f30 and/or f32 too if need be.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1822525#c1)  Tim Theisen    2020-04-09 11:39:42 UTC  ``` I am currently working on this.

HTCondor is a workload management system for high-throughput and
high-performance jobs. Like other full-featured batch systems, HTCondor
provides a job queuing mechanism, scheduling policy, priority scheme,
resource monitoring, and resource management. Users submit their
serial or parallel jobs to HTCondor, HTCondor places them into a queue,
chooses when and where to run the jobs based upon a policy, carefully
monitors their progress, and ultimately informs the user upon
completion.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : condor
Version        : 8.4.11~dfsg.1-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-18823
Debian Bug     : 963777

HTCondor, a distributed workload management system, has Incorrect Access
Control. It is possible to use a different authentication method to submit a
job than the administrator has specified. If the administrator has configured
the READ or WRITE methods to include CLAIMTOBE, then it is possible to
impersonate another user to the condor_schedd, for example to submit or remove
jobs.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
8.4.11~dfsg.1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your condor packages.

For the detailed security status of condor please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/condor>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# HTCONDOR-2020-0003

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| A user with read-only authorization to access the job queue is able to perform write operations under their identity, including submitting new jobs. If CLAIMTOBE is part of the READ authentication methods, then the user is able to impersonate any other user when modifying the job queue. This includes submitting and running jobs as any other user. **By default, CLAIMTOBE is included in the list of methods for READ access.** [CVE-2019-18823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18823) | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | condor\_schedd | All before 8.8.8 (stable) and 8.9.6 (devel) | all | not known to be publicly exploited | 8.8.8, 8.9.6 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | can authenticate to SchedD using any method in the READ list | submit host | medium | high | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2020-03-01 | Zach Miller | | |
| Access Required: |  |
| This vulnerability allows a user to submit a job as long as they can authenticate using one of the methods in the SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION\_LIST of the SchedD and are authorized by the ALLOW\_READ setting. Note that they must still authenticate. However, the user can perform write operations even if the ALLOW\_WRITE authorization setting would normally disallow them. Also, if the list of SEC\_WRITE\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS is more restrictive in types of methods used, the user can circumvent the stronger security by using a perhaps weaker method from the READ list. **If the READ list also contains CLAIMTOBE, the attacker can now submit a job as any user. In a default installation, CLAIMTOBE is part of the list of methods allowed for READ operations.** | |
| Effort Required: | medium |
| A thorough understanding of the HTCondor code and the ability to write custom tools is required to exploit this vulnerability. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | high |
| The configuration that is most vulnerable includes the CLAIMTOBE option as part of the SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS. This is the default. If you have set your own value for SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS, and it does not include CLAIMTOBE, then you are not vulnerable. | |
| Workaround: |
| Ideally, update your installation and you will not need to change any configuration. Alternatively, you can change your configuration to not use CLAIMTOBE in your authentication methods. Explicitly exclude CLAIMTOBE by setting SEC\_READ\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS if you haven't already. The full list of methods by default should be (on Linux) "FS,TOKEN,KERBEROS,GSI,SSL" or (on Windows) "NTSSPI,TOKEN,SSL". In the 8.8.X series you should exclude "TOKEN". You may wish to also exclude other methods you know you are not using. | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# HTCONDOR-2020-0002

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| A piece of secret information is sent over the network in the clear if the administrator has not enabled daemon-to-daemon encryption. For pools configured without daemon-to-daemon encryption, an attacker could use this secret information to control the slot of another user, including running their own code as that user. [CVE-2019-18823](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18823) | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | condor\_startd | All before 8.8.8 (stable) and 8.9.6 (devel) | all | not known to be publicly exploited | 8.8.8, 8.9.6 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | ability to capture traffic between submit and execute machines | N/A | high | high | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2020-03-01 | Todd Tannenbaum | | |
| Access Required: |  |
| Be able to capture network traffic between a condor\_schedd and a condor\_startd. The condor\_config settings must also be configured with no daemon-to-daemon encryption (the default) and match password authentication enabled (the default) to be vulnerable. | |
| Effort Required: | high |
| A thorough understanding of the HTCondor code and the ability to write custom tools is required to exploit this vulnerability. If authentication has been set up for the pool and match password authentication is disabled, the attacker would also need to gain access to the condor credentials. If encryption has also been set up for the pool, you are not vulnerable. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | high |
| Using the secret information, an attacker could manipulate another user's running job, including evicting that job or replacing that job with one that executes the attacker's own code. This could possibly allow the attacker to get access to the user's job data files which may contain sensitive information. Pools that are not configured to use daemon-to-daemon authentication or have match password authentication enabled (the default), and also are not using daemon-to-daemon encryption are vulnerable. | |
| Workaround: |
| Depending on your site configuration, the workaround for this issue may be quite complicated and involve setting up authentication mechanisms that were not previous configured. We **highly** recommend upgrading to the latest version if at all possible, in which case you do not need to work around the issue as the new binaries are no longer vulnerable to this issue. To work around this issue, the administrator will first need to make sure that all daemon-to-daemon communication is authenticated. How this works varies significantly depending on your site configuration. Please consult the HowTo here: <https://htcondor-wiki.cs.wisc.edu/index.cgi/wiki?p=EnablingAuthenticationCveTwo>  After enabling authentication, the administrator can then do one of two things:  1. Configure execute machines to require encryption for daemon-to-daemon communications by setting "SEC\_DAEMON\_ENCRYPTION=REQUIRED" in your HTCondor config file on all execute machines.- Disable match password authentication. To disable match password authentication, set "SEC\_ENABLE\_MATCH\_PASSWORD\_AUTHENTICATION=False" in your HTCondor config file on all execute machines. Be advised that disabling match password authentication can put significant extra load on the submit machines of a large pool (thousands of nodes).   After installing updated binaries or working around the issue, you should restart HTCondor. | |
