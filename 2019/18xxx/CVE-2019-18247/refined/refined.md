- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in the ABB Relion 650 and 670 series devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The devices do not properly validate input messages, leading to a potential denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful attack allows an attacker to force the device to reboot, causing a denial of service. This could disrupt critical operations in the affected infrastructure sectors (Critical Manufacturing and Energy).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted messages over the network (specifically Port 7001/TCP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages to the device over the network. No special privileges or user interaction is required for exploitation. The attack is considered to have a low skill level to exploit.
