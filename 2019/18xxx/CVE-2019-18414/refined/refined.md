- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of CSRF protection in the Restaurant Management System 1.0.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can trick the administrator into executing arbitrary code via a crafted HTML page. This can lead to unauthorized actions being performed on the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page which, when opened by the administrator, executes requests to the vulnerable application without the administrator's knowledge.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick the administrator into opening the malicious HTML page.
