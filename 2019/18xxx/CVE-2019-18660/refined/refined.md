Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-18660:

**Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
*   The Linux kernel for the powerpc architecture failed to properly activate the mitigation for Spectre-RSB (Return Stack Buffer) on context switches for CPUs prior to Power9 DD2.3.
*   The code to flush the link stack (return address stack) was incorrectly tied to a firmware feature enabled only on newer CPUs (P9N DD2.3 and later) instead of being applied to all CPUs affected by Spectre v2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Spectre-RSB Mitigation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper mitigation for the Spectre-RSB vulnerability on context switches on affected PowerPC CPUs.
*   **Speculative Execution Vulnerability:** Spectre-RSB is a variant of the Spectre v2 vulnerability that affects speculative execution. It allows a malicious process to manipulate the Return Stack Buffer (RSB), potentially causing misdirection in the speculative execution of other processes.
*   **Incorrectly Tied Mitigation:** The software fix (link stack flush) was incorrectly dependent on a firmware feature only present on newer CPUs, rather than being implemented for all vulnerable CPUs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Exposure:** An attacker can potentially manipulate the RSB (Link Stack on Power CPUs), causing a victim process to speculatively execute a leak gadget. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information from the victim process through a side-channel attack.
*   **Kernel Exploitation (Guest Exit Path):** The vulnerability can also be used when returning from a guest, where poisoned values on the link stack could lead to malicious behavior within the host kernel. This could expose parts of the host memory or even cause a kernel crash

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Context Switch Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the RSB through normal operations, such as a malicious process creating poisoned values and then forcing a context switch.
*   **Guest Exit Path:**  A malicious guest can poison the link stack before returning control to the host kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must be able to run code on the target system.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs minimal user privileges.
*   **Knowledge of Exploitation Techniques:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of side-channel attacks and how to construct leak gadgets.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Anthony Steinhauser of Google's Safeside Project.
*   The fix involves enabling the link stack flush for all CPUs that have any Spectre v2 mitigation in userspace enabled.
*  A test case is provided that demonstrates the leak and how the fix mitigates the vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was also present when returning from a guest environment, thus a fix was also applied to the guest exit path to mitigate this issue.

**CVSS v3 Vector:** AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N (as per the Openwall source)
*   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker requires local access to the system.
*   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** Exploitation requires specific conditions and is not easily accomplished.
*   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** The attacker needs only low user privileges.
*   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required for exploitation.
*  **S:C (Scope: Changed):** A successful exploit can affect components beyond the vulnerable one, in this case, crossing process boundary.
*   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high potential for sensitive information to be disclosed.
*   **I:N (Integrity: None):** Exploitation does not affect integrity of data or code.
*   **A:N (Availability: None):** Exploitation does not cause system crash.

The provided information indicates a speculative execution vulnerability related to the Spectre-RSB on PowerPC systems, where a lack of proper link stack mitigation during context switching on older CPUs could lead to information exposure and potential exploitation of host kernel upon guest exit. The fix implemented resolves this by enabling link stack flushing on context switches of all vulnerable CPUs and properly handling guest returns to host.
