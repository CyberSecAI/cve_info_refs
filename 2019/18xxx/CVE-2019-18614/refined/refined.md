Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

-   A buffer misconfiguration exists within the *CYW20735* Bluetooth chip firmware. The global variables `BT_ACL_HOST_TO_DEVICE_DEFAULT_SIZE` and `BT_ACL_DEVICE_TO_HOST_DEFAULT_SIZE` are set to 384 bytes, while the chip incorrectly signals a buffer size of 1021 bytes to the host via the `HCI_Read_Buffer_Size` command.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Heap Overflow:** The mismatch between the actual buffer size (384 bytes) and the reported size (1021 bytes) allows for a heap overflow when data exceeding 384 bytes is sent or received via the Bluetooth Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) mode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Heap Overflow:** Sending or receiving data exceeding 384 bytes via ACL causes a heap overflow.
-   **Firmware Crash:** The heap overflow can lead to a firmware crash on the affected *CYW20735* chip.
-  **Hard-Bricking:** Attempting to reconfigure the buffer size using WICED Studio 6.4 results in the evaluation board being hard-bricked. This is likely due to memory issues and the firmware attempting to reload itself.
-   **Inability to Fuzz:** The vulnerability prevented further ACL fuzzing on the emulated *CYW20735* firmware due to the crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Local Exploitation:** Setting up a regular Bluetooth headset for audio streaming, as a user, immediately triggers the heap overflow.
-   **Over-the-Air Exploitation:** Sending *L2Ping* packets exceeding 384 bytes over-the-air triggers the heap overflow.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Physical proximity for over-the-air attack:** The attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range of the vulnerable device.
-   **Standard Bluetooth communication capabilities:** No special privileges needed to establish a connection or send L2Ping packets.
-   **Basic user privileges:** Even setting up a normal Bluetooth connection as a user is enough to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**

-   The vulnerability is specific to the *CYW20735* chip. The *CYW20819* firmware does not exhibit the same issue.
-   The vulnerability is likely unpatched, as there hasn't been a new version of WICED Studio since the discovery of the vulnerability.
-   The provided information indicates that exploiting this issue is straightforward, even a regular user connection can trigger it
-   The heap overflow can be triggered in both directions (device-to-host and host-to-device).
