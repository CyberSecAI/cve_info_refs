### CVE-2019-18858

The content discusses CVE-2019-18858, a **heap buffer overflow** vulnerability in the CODESYS V3 web server, specifically within the `CmpWebServerHandlerV3.dll` component.

- **Root Cause:** Improper validation of user-supplied data sent to the `/WebVisuV3` URL endpoint. An attacker can control the allocation size of a heap buffer using a `WEB_CLIENT_OPENCONNECTION` HTTP message. Subsequently, by sending a `WEB_CLIENT_RUN_SERVICE` HTTP message, the attacker can trigger a `memcpy` operation with attacker-controlled source data and length, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Vulnerability:** Heap buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation and attacker-controlled `memcpy` operation.
- **Impact:** A heap buffer overflow condition, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted HTTP messages to the CODESYS V3 web server.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending malicious HTTP requests to the affected server.
- **Affected Products:** All CODESYS V3 runtime systems containing the web server (CmpWebServer and CmpWebServerHandler) in versions prior to V3.5.15.20.
