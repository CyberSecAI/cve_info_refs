    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the edited user's profile.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious script is submitted via the `phoneNumber` field during user edit.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires a valid user account with permissions to edit user profiles.

2.  **Stored XSS in User Add Form (`/callrec/userAddAction.do`):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `phoneNumber` field in the User Add form is vulnerable to stored XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of the `phoneNumber` field.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the added user's profile.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious script is submitted via the `phoneNumber` field during user creation.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires a valid user account with permissions to create new users.

3.  **Stored XSS in Role Add Form (`/callrec/roleAddAction.do`):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `name` field in the Role Add form is vulnerable to stored XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of the `name` field.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the created role.
    *   **Attack Vector:** A malicious script is submitted via the `name` field during role creation.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires a valid user account with permissions to create new roles.

4.  **Stored XSS in Edit Group Form (`/callrec/roleEditAction.do`):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Both the `name` and `number` fields in the Edit Group form are vulnerable to stored XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of the `name` and `number` fields.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the edited group.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious script submitted through the `name` or `number` fields when editing a group.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires a valid user account with permissions to edit groups.

5.  **Stored XSS in Recording Rules Configuration (`/callrec/recRulesEditAction.do`):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `tagKey` and `tagValue` fields in the Recording Rules Configuration are vulnerable to stored XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of the `tagKey` and `tagValue` fields.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the Recording Rules configuration.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious script submitted via `tagKey` or `tagValue` fields when editing recording rules.
    *  **Attacker Capability:** Requires a valid user account with permissions to manage recording rules.

6. **Stored XSS in `/callrec/config` page:**
    *   **Root Cause**: The `txt_69735:/VemailAddress/value` and `txt_75767:/VemailFrom/value` fields in `/callrec/config` are vulnerable to stored XSS.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper input sanitization of the aforementioned fields.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the config page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Malicious script submitted through the `txt_69735:/VemailAddress/value` or `txt_75767:/VemailFrom/value` fields.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires a valid user account with permissions to configure the application settings.

7.  **Reflected XSS in `/callrec/config` via direct JS injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `selectedMenuId` parameter in `/callrec/config.jsp` is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to direct injection into a javascript variable.
    *   **Weakness:** The application directly injects user-controlled data into a JavaScript context without proper sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious Javascript by crafting a malicious URL.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafted URL with malicious JavaScript in `selectedMenuId` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:**  Requires the target user to click on a crafted link.

8.  **Reflected XSS in `/callrec/config` via XML script element:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `xmlPath` parameter in `/callrec/config` is vulnerable to reflected XSS due to improper handling of XML responses.
    *   **Weakness:** The application reflects back user-provided XML data which includes script elements without proper sanitization or encoding, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious Javascript
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious Javascript by crafting a malicious POST request.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafted POST request with a malicious script in the `xmlPath` parameter.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires the target user to view the response of the malicious POST request.

9.  **Stored XSS in `/callrec/logs_view.jsp` via RabbitMQ:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The logging textarea in `/callrec/logs_view.jsp` is vulnerable to XSS because it does not properly sanitize messages received from the RabbitMQ component.
    *   **Weakness:** The application directly displays messages from RabbitMQ in a textarea without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML/JS content.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject a malicious script that will execute when the user views the logs.
    *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can send a malicious message to RabbitMQ, which will be displayed in the log view.
    *   **Attacker Capability:** Requires knowledge of RabbitMQ setup and credentials or control over the RabbitMQ component.

**General Impacts:**

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive data, granting unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **Malware Distribution:** XSS can be used to redirect users to malicious sites or download malware.
*   **Defacement:** The application's interface could be altered to deface the application, disrupting its functionality and displaying malicious content.
*   **Account Takeover:** Successful execution of XSS can lead to account takeover if the attacker steals session cookies or credentials.

**General Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** Most of these vulnerabilities are exploited via the web interface of the application by manipulating form fields.
*   **RabbitMQ:** One vulnerability involves injecting malicious content through the RabbitMQ messaging system.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Vary based on the specific vulnerability, but generally, they require a valid user account, often with specific privileges (e.g., user management, role management, etc).
* For some vulnerabilities (e.g. reflected XSS in `/callrec/config` or XSS in `/callrec/logs_view.jsp`), it requires the user to click a malicious link or view a malicious response.
*   Exploiting the RabbitMQ vulnerability requires the attacker to have knowledge of the RabbitMQ configuration or some sort of access to RabbitMQ component.
