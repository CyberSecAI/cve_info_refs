Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-18922

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in the web interface of the Allied Telesis AT-GS950/8 network switch. This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and access files outside of the web server's root directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the path in the GET request, allowing "../" sequences to move up the directory structure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary File Read: An attacker can read any file on the system that the web server user has permissions to access. This could include sensitive configuration files, password files, or other system data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP GET Request: The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the web server on the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected device's web interface. This typically requires being on the same network as the device or having some form of network access to it.
- No Authentication Required: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any form of authentication.
