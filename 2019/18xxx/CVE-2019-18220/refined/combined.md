Changelog 2017-07-01 #3 - Templates - Added \_BaseGeneric from Sitemagic 4.2.3 for compatibility. Old templates may still depend on it.
Changelog 2017-07-01 #2 - Templates - Renamed \_BaseGeneric to \_BaseGeneric2 and Sunrise to Sunrise2 to prevent compatibility problems for users upgrading from older versions. - Removed all remaining templates - some will be recreated later with Sunrise2 as the foundation, while others will be left out due to low quality. - Base - SMTemplate: Added support for \_BaseGeneric2 (includes).
Changelog 2017-07-01 #1 - Base - SMTemplate: Fixed bug in GetTemplates() causing inaccessible templates to be returned (insufficient folder permissions). - Extensions - SMLanguageHandler: Fixed bug that caused exception when one tried to create translations for an extension where no translation file existed the given language.

This replaces overflow:auto which breaks text shadows or padding-top/bottom:1px which affects the visual result on high-res displays supporting sub pixels. - Support for moving up TPLBottom behind content area has been improved so that TPLContent and TPLFooter no longer need to have position:relative set. - Sunrise - Removed styling no longer necessary. - Made sure margin collapse cannot be disabled for TPLHeader and TPLFooter by applying padding-top/bottom: 0px. - Made adjustments necessary to support how margin collapse is now disabled.
Changelog 2017-06-05 - Base - SMClient: Made AddEventHandler handle compatibility problem with DOMContentLoaded event on IE8. - Extensions - SMPages - .htaccess no longer rewrites HTML requests to Sitemagic if a matching HTML file is found in the file system. The old behaviour prevented Google from loading their Analytics verification file, making it difficult to integrate Google Analytics. - Fixed compatibility problem with image selection in TinyMCE on Chrome 58+: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=732123 - Minor improvements to Fluid Grids. - SMDesigner: - Now allow Designer Definition to change the default CSS unit for dimension controls using e.g. SMDesigner.Helpers.DefaultDimensionUnit = "em"; in the GetEditors callback. - Indentation Controls' Slider now assume the CSS unit passed from the GetEditors callback, and automatically assumes appropriate min/max/step-by values. - Designer now exposes an Update function allowing Designer Definition to programmatically trigger an update, forcing GetCss(..) to be triggered. - Combined controls (associated selector and slider) can now individually be hidden. - Fixed problem in GetDimensionCss(..) which returned "0" when no value as entered, but that doesn't work properly with calc(..) which requires a unit, so it now returns "0px" instead. - Templates - BaseGeneric - Footer, Page, and Snippets now uses the em CSS unit. - Snippet title switched from h1 tag to ordinary div to prevent conflicts with ordinary headings on page. - Moved responsiveness.normal.js from Sunrise to BaseGeneric. - Made BaseGeneric itself load javascript enhancements. - Improvements and bug fixes. - Sunrise - Added support for setting the base font size on Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile under the General section. This makes it much easier making the site adjust to resolutions using the em CSS unit. - Added support for stretching header, menu, and footer across the entire page. - Added support for styling headings (h1-h6). - Added support for text shadows on menu and headings. - Added support for page specific background image. - Added support for page specific background color in content area. - Added support for page specific header images within content area. - Added support for styling extension pages separate from content pages. - Added support for styling Fluid Grid Cards. NOTICE: Traditional Cards are now obsolete. - Added support for styling Action Buttons. - Added support for styling custom elements defined in templates using e.g.: <span class="SMDesignerElement" data-id="My element">Hello</span> For elements found only on certain pages, we need to tell the designer to always preserve styling, even when an element is not found on a given page. This is done simply by adding the data-preserve attribute with a value of true: <span class="SMDesignerElement" data-id="My element" data-preserve="true">Hello</span> - Added CSS Editor dialog for advanced CSS editing. - Replaced use of px unit with relative em unit almost everywhere. - Rewrote footer JS enhancement. - A lot of fixes and improvements.
Changelog 2017-05-08 - Extensions - SMDesigner: Fixed bug preventing user from downloading active template - a whitespace corrupted the ZIP file.
Changelog 2017-05-07 #2 - Templates - Sunrise - Default styles (style.css) - CSS em unit now used for input fields, fieldset legends, header, menu links, and card header and footer. - Fixed problem with em unit on table cells and fieldset legends causing size to increase incorrectly. - Spacing between header and menu is now achieved using padding rather than margin. - Removed default padding left/right in menu. - Removed default padding top/bottom on TPLPage container making it difficult to position e.g. header or menu, often requiring use of negative margins. - Removed dublicate styling for table cells which today obtain font styling properly on recent versions of IE. - TPLContent and TPLFooter now has position:relative to make sure TPLBottom can move up behind them using negative margin.
Changelog 2017-05-07 #1 - Templates - BaseGeneric: - Properly fixed problem with spacing between menu items that was previously fixed using CSS which unfortunately prevented the use of em units when the menu was styled. - Sunrise: - Enhancements: Added JS enhancements that adds window size break points as an alternative to media queries to better support legacy IE, and an improvement to the footer allowing it to stick to the bottom of the window when window is higher than the content.
Changelog 2017-05-06 - Base - SMEnvironment: Fixed bug preventing cookie prefix on primary website if installed to a subfolder on the domain making it handle cookies like on subsites. - SMLanguageHandler: Fixed Null Pointer Exception when trying to fall back to English for missing translations. Bug was introduced when a variable was renamed. - Extensions - SMContact: Fixed bug preventing Email field from being Required - flag was ignored when sending mail. - SMLogViewer: Added new log viewer extension making it easier to debug Sitemagic in case of errors. - SMTips: Made sure Disable button is only visible when authorized (logged in).
Changelog 2017-04-24 - Base - SMLanguageHandler: Added support for fallback allowing for incomplete translation files to be used. - SMMail - Sender can now be configured using config.xml.php. - Fixed bug where Reply-To was set as From and Sender. - Extensions - SMConfig: SMTP Sender can now be configured. - SMContact: Re-introduced Email field which is now used to allow website to send a copy of the e-mail to the user (CC recipient). - SMDesigner: Added support for OnReset event. - SMLanguageEditor: Made minor adjustments necessary after implementing support for translation fallback.
Changelog 2017-04-11 - Base - SMClient: SMWindow now supports Modal mode. - SMStringUtilities: Added RemoveInvalidCharacters function. - Extensions - SMContact: - Removed support for field type Reply To, which causes Spam Assassin and other filters to consider e-mails sent from contact forms to be spam. - Removed filename restrictions. Invalid characters are now simply removed from attachment filename. - Fixed layout problems on legacy IE (common.css) - SMDesigner: - Added UnrecognizedValues to eventArgs which exposes values saved that no longer has any associated controls. Designer Definition may decide to keep these values by assigning a Preserve flag to each value individually. This may be used to support designer elements not defined on all pages. - SMPages: - Placeholders can now be used within content pages. Including another page (e.g. ContactDetails) can be achieved using e.g. {[@ContactDetails]}. - Templates - BaseGeneric: - Minor tweaks to External Modules in Fluid Grids. - Fixed problem with em CSS unit in table cells and legends causing text to assume twice the size specified in Designer. - Improved base settings for headings. - Misc. - Removed line breaks within headings in demo pages to ease styling using Designer. - Various minor improvements.
Changelog 2017-03-25 - Base - SMMail: Now adds Text Body and surrounding HTML container to satisfy Spam Assassin and other spam filters. - Extensions - SMDesigner: - Added support for Page selector control. - Increased width of controls. - Designer definition: GetSelectors(..) is now invoked AFTER data has been loaded and CSS applied, allowing selectors to be adjusted based on changes made by the user. It also gets invoked every time the design is changed. - Designer definition: The label for editor controls may now consist of both an internal value and a display value separated by semicolon, allowing multiple controls with the same display value to hold values for multiple pages. Example: Background;PageBackground046f8e2c3ade408eab20aacf10fe7c01 Background;PageBackground110cc0e318b045c5b613b03abd03b724. The Designer allows us to hide controls, making it possible to assicoate controls with specific pages, and hide all controls not related to the current page being manipulated. - Designer definition: GetEditors(..) may now return multiple root entries with the same display value if a unique ID is appended after a semicolon. Example: { "Test;T1": { .. }, "Test;T2": { .. } }. - Added support for combined Slider and Input control. - Replaced SMDesigner.Helpers.SyncType.UnidirectionalEqual (singular) with SMDesigner.Helpers.SyncType.UnidirectionalEquals (plural) while ensuring backward compatibility. Also introduced SMDesigner.Helpers.SyncType.UnidirectionalEqualsOrNull. - It is now possible to have a selector deep linking to a specific accordion by separating the section key from the accordion key using semicolon. Example: GetSelectors: function(eventArgs) { return { "Headings;Heading 1": "h1" }; } - Added support for sorting to Selector control. Top menu is now sorted. - Added support for GetDefaultSection(..) which can be used to return the initial section such as "Background" or "Menu", matching an index from an entry returned from GetSelectors(..). - Designer definition: Added support for OnDataLoaded(..) which fires after data has been loaded, allowing control manipulation based on saved values. - Minor fixes and improvements. - Dimension controls now consist of an input field, a CSS unit selector, and a value slider. - Added support for text shadows and letter spacing. - Default CSS font unit is now "em" rather than "px". - Added helper functions for handling headings (e.g. <h1>).
