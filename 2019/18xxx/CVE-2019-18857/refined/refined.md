Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed in the commit `51ca4b713f3706d6b27769c6296bbc0c28a5bbd0` which seems to relate to CVE-2019-18857, based on the commit message "Merge branch 'hotfix/31-xss-bypass'".

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an insufficient regular expression used to sanitize SVG content. The original regex `/(?:\w+script|data):/xi`  failed to capture cases where a space character was present after `script` or `data` in an attribute value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) bypass. The insufficient regex allowed for crafted SVG files with malicious `script` or `data` attributes to bypass sanitization, leading to potential injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application using the SVG sanitizer. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
*   Stealing user session cookies or credentials.
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
*   Defacing the application or modifying its behavior.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious SVG file containing attributes such as `xlink:href`, `href`, `src`, or similar, which contain a `script` or `data` keyword followed by a space, then a colon. For example:
```html
<svg>
  <a xlink:href=" javascript:alert('XSS')"></a>
  <image href=" data :text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnWFNTJyk7PC9zY3JpcHQ+" />
</svg>
```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would need the ability to submit or upload SVG files that are then processed using the vulnerable SVG sanitizer. The attacker does not need privileged access, but needs to be able to influence the SVG content that is processed.

**Changes Made in the Commit:**
The commit modifies the regular expression used for sanitization from `/(?:\w+script|data):/xi` to `/(?:\w+script|data)(?:\s)?:/xi`. The `(?:\s)?` non-capturing group allows an optional space to be present after `script` or `data`, preventing the bypass.
The commit also includes two new test files, `hrefCleanOne.svg` and `hrefTestOne.svg`, which are likely testing the fix.
