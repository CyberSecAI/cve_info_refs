(CVE) ID: CVE-2019-18421
CVE Description: PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval
```

```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The code contains several races that, if triggered, can cause Xen to drop or retain extra type counts.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Races conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion operations, specifically in the handling of recursive promotions. The type system used to track page usage has flaws in its implementation.

Impact of exploitation:
A malicious PV guest administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host, by getting write access to in-use pagetables, leading to potential data corruption, denial of service, or privilege escalation.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is triggered by exploiting race conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion operations, which could allow a malicious PV guest to gain access to in-use pagetables.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be a malicious PV guest administrator. The attacker needs precise timing to exploit the races. HVM, and PVH guests, and guests on ARM systems cannot exploit the vulnerability.
