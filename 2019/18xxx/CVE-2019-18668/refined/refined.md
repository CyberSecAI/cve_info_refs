Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-18668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the Currency Switcher for WooCommerce plugin not properly validating the selected currency against the enabled currencies in the plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The plugin fails to verify if the requested currency is among the allowed currencies, leading to the possibility of bypassing restrictions.
- **Forced Currency Conversion:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to force a currency conversion even if the currency is not enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Price Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the price of products by forcing conversion to a currency with a lower value, effectively purchasing goods at a significantly reduced cost.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the currency parameter, likely via a URL parameter, to force a currency that is not enabled in the plugin's settings.
- Specific attack vector: Appending the `alg_currency` variable to a URL with the desired currency code `http://www.yoursite.com?alg_currency=USD`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker only needs basic knowledge of how to interact with a web application and manipulate URL parameters.
- **No Prior Authentication Required:** The attack can be carried out without needing to log in or have specific privileges.
- **Publicly Accessible Webshop:** The target is a webshop utilizing the vulnerable plugin and accessible via the internet.
