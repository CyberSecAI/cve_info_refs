# Critical vulnerability in Currency Switcher for WooCommerce

---

![](/upload/tbl_novosti/hacker5_202103013357.jpg)During one of our penetration tests we have found a critical security vulnerability in Currency Switcher for WooCommerce – the new, improved, version is out so upgrade ASAP

Our intrepid researcher Luka Sikic was exploring a Currency Switcher a popular plugin for WooCommerce with more than 5000 installations on WordPress. It has features like automatic currency exchange rates updates, prices on per product basis, currency by country...

During one of our latest penetration tests we had a chance to attack a webshop using the beforementioned plugin and Luka found a critical vulnerability. To make a long story short, in version 2.11.1 and earlier we could force a currency that isn't enabled in the settings and basically do a conversion in a currency that is valued less to get a product for a fraction of a price.

We have notified the developer of the plugin, WP Wham, who reacted swiftly and remedied the problem. The new [version](https://wordpress.org/plugins/currency-switcher-woocommerce/#developers) of the plugin, 2.11.2, is bug free so we urge all users to switch to that one.

Vulnerability got an official CVE-ID - [CVE-2019-18668](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18668).

## Installation

1. Upload the entire ‘currency-switcher-woocommerce’ folder to the ‘/wp-content/plugins/’ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.
3. Start by visiting plugin settings at WooCommerce > Settings > Currency Switcher.

## FAQ

### Issues regarding Paypal

* If you are experiencing some sort of issue regarding paypal, like incorrect currency code displayed in notification emails or anything else, please try to disable the default paypal component bundled with WooCommerce and use [this plugin instead](https://www.angelleye.com/product/woocommerce-paypal-plugin/)

### How to get the converted price

If you are trying to display the converted price on a custom template for example you can use our `alg_get_product_price_by_currency()` function.

e.g

```
add_action('woocommerce_single_product_summary', function(){
    if ( ! class_exists( 'Alg_WC_Currency_Switcher' ) ) {
        return;
    }
    global $product;
    $price = get_post_meta( get_the_ID(), '_regular_price', true);
    $converted_price = alg_get_product_price_by_currency( $price, alg_get_current_currency_code(), $product, true );
    $converted_price_formatted = wc_price( $converted_price );
    echo "<h1>{$converted_price}</h1>";
    echo "<h1>{$converted_price_formatted}</h1>";
});

```

### CoinMarketCap not working?

Please make sure you are using at least one Cryptocurrency on your Currency settings.

You can install [All Currencies for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-all-currencies/) plugin to enable them

### National Bank of Georgia

If you are trying the National Bank of Georgia server option with no success, make sure that your server has the SoapClient library installed and enabled

### How to override rounding and pretty price per currency?

If you want for example to turn on the rounding for all products except for Bitcoin, supposing you’ve enabled rounding and pretty price on plugin’s settings:

```
add_filter( 'alg_wc_currency_switcher_correction', function ( $correction, $currency ) {
    if ( $currency == 'BTC' ) {
        $correction['rounding'] = 'no_round';
        $correction['pretty_price'] = 'no';
    }

    return $correction;
}, 10, 2 );

```

### How to force currency by URL

If you want to set a currency just accessing an URL you can append the **alg\_currency** variable with the currency code you want.

e.g

```
http://www.yoursite.com?alg_currency=USD

```

I had to go trough 7 plugins before I found out this one. Plugin configuration is so simple, straightforward and lightweight. It ‘s simple to work with and does exactly what I needed. Thank you for Best Free Plugin Currency Switcher for WooCommerce. I’ll be taking a look to the pro version for future requirements. Excellent job of the developers. Highly recommended!

My other plugin was unable to apply currency conversion to the free shipping amount. This plugin did that too. Keep up the good work.

I tried other 2 plugins (with many good reviews) but didn’t
turn out well. Until i tried your plugin, worked quite well.
No issue so far.
Question: in the JS and PHP code, how to check which currency is
currently active?
thanks

the switcher works great, it offers different appearances (drop down menu of the currencies, radio buttons or links). I was able to also integrate it into a main menu of WP (with an additional tweak).
The switcher is intelligently done (regarding all imaginable options) and has also a good and clear documentation (see their website, not here in the wordpress forum!).
The only thing I would wish is to have an easier visual customisation for colours and text, for the way the switcher appears and integrates in other WP menus; perhaps with some kind of selector (to mostly avoid CSS coding).
