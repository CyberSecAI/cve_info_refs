Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-18634:

**Root Cause:**

*   A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Sudo.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `pwfeedback` option is enabled in `/etc/sudoers`.
*   The `getln()` function in `tgetpass.c` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it doesn't properly handle write errors when erasing the line of asterisks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Stack-based buffer overflow.
*   Improper handling of write errors in the `getln()` function.
*   `pwfeedback` option not ignored when reading from a non-tty.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Local users may be able to escalate privileges to the root account.
*   Disclosure of sensitive information.
*   Addition or modification of data.
*   Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash.
*   Arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker delivers a long string to the stdin of the `getln()` function in `tgetpass.c`.
*   Exploiting the bug does not require sudo permissions, only that pwfeedback is enabled.
*   The bug can be reproduced by passing a large input to sudo via a pipe when it prompts for a password, or using a pseudo-terminal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Local user access is required.
*   The `pwfeedback` option must be enabled in the `/etc/sudoers` file.
*   For some exploitation methods, the ability to create a symbolic link may be needed.

**Mitigation:**

*   Disable the `pwfeedback` option in the `/etc/sudoers` file by prepending an exclamation point: `Defaults !pwfeedback`.
*   Upgrade to Sudo version 1.8.31 or later.
*   Ensure the system is configured with stack-protector feature.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Sudo versions 1.7.1 to 1.8.30 inclusive are affected but only if the "pwfeedback" option is enabled in sudoers.
*   Specifically, sudo versions 1.7.1 to 1.8.25p1 are more easily exploitable due to EOF handling.

**Important Notes:**

*   The `pwfeedback` option is NOT enabled by default in upstream Sudo or in some distributions like SUSE and Slackware. It must be explicitly enabled by an administrator.
*   Systems with unidirectional pipes are more susceptible to the vulnerability.
*   Red Hat systems are compiled with gcc's stack-protector feature, which may help mitigate code execution attacks.
