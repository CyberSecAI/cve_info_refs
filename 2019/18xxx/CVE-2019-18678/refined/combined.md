Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-0b16cbdd0e
2019-12-05 01:09:44.879358
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc30
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-9538783033
2019-12-05 01:39:12.688383
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 4.9
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Squid Proxy Cache Security Update Advisory SQUID-2019:10
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Advisory ID: SQUID-2019:10
Date: November 05, 2019
Summary: HTTP Request Splitting issue
in HTTP message processing.
Affected versions: Squid 3.0 -> 3.5.28
Squid 4.x -> 4.8
Fixed in version: Squid 4.9
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019\_10.txt
http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18678
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Problem Description:
Due to incorrect message parsing Squid is vulnerable to an HTTP
request splitting issue.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Severity:
This issue allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests through
frontend software to a Squid which splits the HTTP Request
pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages corrupt
caches between client and Squid with attacker controlled content
at arbitrary URLs..
Effects are isolated to software between the attacker client and
Squid. There are no effects on Squid itself, nor any upstream
servers.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Updated Packages:
This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.9.
In addition, a patch addressing this problem for the stable
releases can be found in our patch archives:
Squid 4:
If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer
to the package vendor for availability information on updated
packages.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Determining if your version is vulnerable:
All Squid-2.x have not been checked.
All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.
All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 are vulnerable.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Workarounds:
There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Debian Bug     : 950802 931478 950925 912294

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by multiple security vulnerabilities.
Due to incorrect input validation and URL request handling it was
possible to bypass access restrictions for restricted HTTP servers
and to cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
3.5.23-5+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

For the detailed security status of squid3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/squid3>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Package        : squid3
Version        : 3.4.8-6+deb8u9
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-12526 CVE-2019-18677 CVE-2019-18678
                 CVE-2019-18679

It was found that Squid, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, has been affected by the following security
vulnerabilities.

CVE-2019-12526

     URN response handling in Squid suffers from a heap-based buffer
     overflow. When receiving data from a remote server in response to
     an URN request, Squid fails to ensure that the response can fit
     within the buffer. This leads to attacker controlled data
     overflowing in the heap.

CVE-2019-18677

     When the append_domain setting is used (because the appended
     characters do not properly interact with hostname length
     restrictions), it can inappropriately redirect traffic to origins
     it should not be delivered to. This happens because of incorrect
     message processing.

CVE-2019-18678

     A programming error allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests
     through frontend software to a Squid instance that splits the HTTP
     Request pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages
     corrupt caches (between a client and Squid) with
     attacker-controlled content at arbitrary URLs. Effects are isolated
     to software between the attacker client and Squid.
     There are no effects on Squid itself, nor on any upstream servers.
     The issue is related to a request header containing whitespace
     between a header name and a colon.

CVE-2019-18679

     Due to incorrect data management, Squid is vulnerable to
     information disclosure when processing HTTP Digest Authentication.
     Nonce tokens contain the raw byte value of a pointer that sits
     within heap memory allocation. This information reduces ASLR
     protections and may aid attackers isolating memory areas to target
     for remote code execution attacks.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.4.8-6+deb8u9.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.

Obey the RFC requirement to reject HTTP requests with whitespace

between field-name and the colon delimiter. Rejection is

critical in the presence of broken HTTP agents that mishandle

malformed messages.

Also obey requirement to always strip such whitespace from HTTP

response messages. The relaxed parser is no longer necessary for

this response change.

For now non-HTTP protocols retain the old behaviour of removal

only when using the relaxed parser.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Please adjust this PR description to explain *why* we are now rejecting requests with spaces after fields names. Simply referring to an "RFC requirement" is not sufficient IMO because our relaxed parser should and does violate RFC requirements. We ought to have a more serious/compelling motivation for this change than just following RFC requirements.

I also have one API fix request. The rest is optional polishing.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This begins a cascade of side effects via push\_back inside addEntry() needing the type of HttpHeaderEntry::entries vector to match the const'ness of this auto. Fixing the const'ness is going to have to be left until later.

It does not. You are probably thinking about `const auto *e`. I am asking for `const auto e` which is a constant `e` (the pointer) and not the constant entry (the thing `e` is pointing to).

Relaxed is for abnormal syntax where the spec leaves interpretation up to the implementation, or explicitly outlines a tolerant handling for it. If you can point out code using relaxed parser to directly violate the spec in a --disable-http-violations build that is a bug we need to fix. |

| I think these being a MUST requirement should be enough justification.  I do not. And I suspect that admins that will start complaining about this change will agree with me. If you can make these violations conditional on `--enable-http-violations`, then I would support that. If you cannot, then use the reason *why* you cannot to justify this change. |

| Very well, since you insist: By placing whitespace between the field name and colon of an HTTP request any client can perform the following actions:   * open an arbitrary two-way tunnel to any server using only a GET or POST request. * inject content into the Squid cache. * corrupt arbitrary existing cache entries, * scan the internal structure of a CDN or ISP using Squid.   You want the 0-day code published too?   These are currently the behaviour when relaxed parser is enabled (on by default) but can be disabled by turning it off. Placing it behind --enable-http-violations would leave these as the default behaviour of nearly all Squid but remove the config option to disable, since you and others insist that option remain as set by default on builds. |

| It feels like my basic concern is agitating you for some unknown to me reason, but I have to ask to understand: Assuming Squid recognizes and removes that extra space before interpreting and forwarding header fields, do those horrors require something else, like a second broken proxy or a broken origin server? I do not see how an extra space *alone* can do that damage if all agents are aware of the problem and avoid misinterpreting header fields with extra spaces. |

> All that is required is that Squid tolerates whitespace before the colon

I reread the report you were referring to and it appears to directly support my suspicion that all these horrors that you are describing do require a second/broken actor. If all actors, including fixed Squid, remove or just ignore broken header fields, then nothing bad happens.

Thus, our justification for rejecting malformed messages cannot be simply that removing malformed fields would expose Squid to various horrors. Our justification would be that removing malformed fields would expose (Squid plus some other broken agent) *combination* to various horrors. This is still bad, of course, but the requirement to have a broken agent in the mix is important in our considerations because many Squid deployments do not have a broken agent behind them and, hence, are immune from all these horrors (and may not want to be responsible for other broken agents out there). We will be penalizing those deployments because we do not want to make this behavior conditional/configurable.

We can still penalize immune deployments if you think that is the best way forward. I suggest using the following first paragraph for this PR description:

```
Obey the RFC requirement to reject HTTP requests with whitespace between
field-name and the colon delimiter. Rejection is critical in the
presence of broken HTTP agents that mishandle malformed messages.

```

If you insist on your PR description wording, I can live with that as well (now that I confirmed what the trade-offs really are).

Please see inlined change requests for a new bug fix (with an easy-to-implement option) and a trivial polishing change that was mishandled during the previous round.

If you would rather not enhance this reporting in this PR, we can just use the old message (without Raw, at level 2) -- this debugging is not a big deal, of course. If you prefer to use Raw, then there is a PR bug to fix and a few improvements to make:

1. The combination of value\_start and name\_len does not make sense. There are several ways to fix that, but if we only report one thing, then we should be reporting the offending *name*.
2. Raw() already prints data length so you do not need to print `name_len << " bytes` manually.
3. It is best *not* to surround Raw output with your own decorations -- let Raw take care of that (and enhance Raw if you feel more decor is a good idea in some cases).
4. It is wrong to print 65+K worth of name characters to cache.log, even at level 2. The first few characters should be more than enough to triage the problem in most cases, and printing huge volumes of information is likely to cause more problems than it will solve in this case. I would suggest printing the first 100 bytes or so.

This needs to be tested to get the minor details right, but we should be using something like this:

Suggested change

|  | debugs(55, 2, "found header name of " << name\_len << " bytes (" << Raw("value\_start", value\_start, name\_len) << ")"); |
| --- | --- |
|  | debugs(55, 2, "ignoring huge header field" << Raw("name", field\_start, name\_len).maxSize(100)); |

Please let me know if you need my help adding Raw::maxSize(). It would be generally useful, of course. We may even want to make a limit like that the default Raw behavior, but adding that default would require going through (few) current Raw uses to disable that limit for exceptional cases like TLS Hello dumping where the limit is harmful.

It does not. You are probably thinking about `const auto *e`. I am asking for `const auto e` which is a constant `e` (the pointer) and not the constant entry (the thing `e` is pointing to).

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1156323#c0)  Robert Frohl   2019-11-08 15:29:07 UTC  ``` Problem Description:   Due to incorrect message parsing Squid is vulnerable to an HTTP  request splitting issue.  __________________________________________________________________  Severity:   This issue allows attackers to smuggle HTTP requests through  frontend software to a Squid which splits the HTTP Request  pipeline differently. The resulting Response messages corrupt  caches between client and Squid with attacker controlled content  at arbitrary URLs..   Effects are isolated to software between the attacker client and  Squid. There are no effects on Squid itself, nor any upstream  servers.  __________________________________________________________________  Updated Packages:   This bug is fixed by Squid version 4.9.   In addition, a patch addressing this problem for the stable  releases can be found in our patch archives:  Squid 4:  <<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v4/changesets/squid-4-671ba97abe929156dc4c717ee52ad22fba0f7443.patch>>   If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please refer  to the package vendor for availability information on updated  packages.  __________________________________________________________________  Determining if your version is vulnerable:   All Squid-2.x have not been checked.   All Squid-3.x up to and including 3.5.28 are vulnerable.   All Squid-4.x up to and including 4.8 are vulnerable.  __________________________________________________________________  Workarounds:   There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.  <http://www.squid-cache.org/Advisories/SQUID-2019_10.txt> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1156323#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-08 17:00:11 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1156323) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/746661> Factory / squid ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1156323#c3)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-14 20:14:59 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2975-1: An update that fixes 12 vulnerabilities is now available.

# Squid: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202003-34**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Squid, the worst of
which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-proxy/squid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.10** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.10** |

### Background

Squid is a full-featured Web proxy cache designed to run on Unix
systems. It supports proxying and caching of HTTP, FTP, and other URLs,
as well as SSL support, cache hierarchies, transparent caching, access
control lists and many other features.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid. Please review
the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker, by sending a specially crafted request, could
possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process,
obtain sensitive information or cause a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Squid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-proxy/squid-4.10"

```

handled certain URN requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this

issue to bypass access checks and access restricted servers. This issue was

only addressed in Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-12523](/security/CVE-2019-12523))

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handed URN responses. A remote

attacker could use this issue to cause Squid to crash, resulting in a

denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-12526](/security/CVE-2019-12526))

Alex Rousskov discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain strings. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Squid to crash,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 19.04.

([CVE-2019-12854](/security/CVE-2019-12854))

Jeriko One and Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly

handled certain input. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause

Squid to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute

arbitrary code. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu

19.10. ([CVE-2019-18676](/security/CVE-2019-18676))

Kristoffer Danielsson discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain

messages. This issue could result in traffic being redirected to origins

it should not be delivered to. ([CVE-2019-18677](/security/CVE-2019-18677))

Régis Leroy discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain HTTP

request headers. A remote attacker could use this to smuggle HTTP requests

and corrupt caches with arbitrary content. ([CVE-2019-18678](/security/CVE-2019-18678))

David Fifield discovered that Squid incorrectly handled HTTP Digest

Authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to obtain

pointer contents and bypass ASLR protections. ([CVE-2019-18679](/security/CVE-2019-18679))

                 CVE-2020-8450 CVE-2020-11945

Multiple security issues were discovered in the Squid proxy caching
server, which could result in the bypass of security filters, information
disclosure, the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.6-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.
