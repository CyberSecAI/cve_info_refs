Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18671:

*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer Overflow
*   **Location:** KeepKey hardware wallet's USB receive buffer
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient checks on the size of "tiny" protobuf messages received over USB. The KeepKey firmware doesn't properly validate if the received messages are actually "tiny" before processing them. Specifically, the code trusts that a small target buffer will be large enough for the expanded message after decoding.
*   **Weakness:** The `pb_parse()` function calls the Nanopb library's `pb_decode()` function, trusting that the small target buffer will be large enough for the expanded message. However, some protobuf input message definitions can have valid, short encoded representations when sent over USB but require much more space when decoded due to large `max_size` or optional fields. This leads to out-of-bounds writes.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Attacker sends a regular operation that puts the KeepKey into a state where feedback via a "tiny" message is expected (e.g., physical button confirmation).
    2.  The attacker sends a crafted USB packet containing a protobuf message. The encoded size is small enough to pass the initial size check.
    3.  The `msg_id` is checked against a list of all known protobuf input message types, but it does not verify if the message actually belongs to the "tiny" message subset.
    4.  The attacker-controlled message body (up to 55 bytes) is passed to `tiny_dispatch()`.
    5.  `pb_parse()` is called with a target buffer (`msg_tiny`) of size 64.
    6.  `pb_decode()` expands the message, causing out-of-bounds writes to memory locations behind `msg_tiny`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Out-of-bounds writes in device memory, potentially leading to code execution. The attacker can overwrite memory areas in or behind the `.bss` segment with known values, potentially changing the program flow and compromising the device.
    *   The vulnerability can be triggered without unlocking the device (without PIN).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Ability to send USB packets to the KeepKey device.
    *   Malware or physical access to a stolen device could be used for automated attacks.
*   **Fix:** The code was reworked to perform checks to ensure the `msg_id` corresponds to one of the five whitelisted "tiny" message types via a switch-case statement *before* calling `pb_decode()`.
*   **Affected Versions:** It's assumed all recent versions before the fix are affected.
*   **Fixed Version:** v6.2.2
*   **Disclosure:** The vulnerability was disclosed to ShapeShift in September 2019, and a fix was released within 19 days.
