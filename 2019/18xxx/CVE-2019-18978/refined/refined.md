### CVE-2019-18978
The rack-cors rubygem before 1.0.4 for Ruby is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing access to private resources. The vulnerability arises because resource matching doesn't ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format. An attacker can exploit this by using "../" in the path to bypass CORS restrictions and access unauthorized resources. The issue is resolved by unescaping and resolving paths before resource checks.

- **Vulnerability:** Directory Traversal
- **Root Cause:** Improper pathname handling in resource matching. Resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format.
- **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the URL path to include directory traversal sequences ("../").
- **Impact:** Unauthorized access to private resources.
- **Affected versions:**  < 1.0.4
- **Fixed versions:** 1.0.4
