Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-18231:

**CVE-2019-18231: Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information**

*   **Root Cause:** The web management interface of the affected Advantech routers uses unencrypted HTTP transmission and Basic authentication, transmitting login credentials (username and password) in cleartext.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
    *   Use of unencrypted HTTP.
    *   Use of Basic authentication, which is prone to interception when used over unencrypted channels.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker on the same local network as the affected router can intercept the cleartext credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the device's web management interface and its configurations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network sniffing within the local network (LAN) where the router is connected.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks within the same network segment.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs to be on the same local network (LAN) as the affected router.
    *   The attacker must have the ability to capture network traffic (e.g., via sniffing)

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is remotely exploitable but only within the local network because web management is not accessible over the WAN by default.
*   The vendor advises disabling HTTP and always using HTTPS instead as a mitigation. HTTPS was always enabled in the firmware even version 5.1.3
*  HTTP has been disabled by default since firmware version 6.2.0.
*   The provided CISA advisory and the vendor's advisory both highlight that the vulnerability is fixed in newer firmware versions and suggest upgrading.
