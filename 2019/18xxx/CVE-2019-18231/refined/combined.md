## 4. MITIGATIONS

For additional information, please see Advantech Security Advisory [SA-2021-01-01](https://ep.advantech-bb.cz/support/router-models/download/511/sa-2021-01-fw-5.1.3-and-older-en.pdf)

Advantech recommends users update to [Version 6.2.7](https://www.advantech-bb.cz/firmware) or later.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize a VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

SECURITY ADVISORY

Security Vulnerabilities in Firmware
Versions 5.1.3 and Older

Summary

Several critical security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Spectre RT ERT351 and
B+B SmartWorx ERT351 ﬁrmware versions 5.1.3 (released in April 2015) and older. These
vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely with low skills and affect any Advantech industrial cel-
lular routers with this ﬁrmware. Most of the vulnerabilities have already been ﬁxed in the
ﬁrmware version 6.1.10 (released in July 2019), however for security reasons we strongly rec-
ommend using always the latest ﬁrmware version and conﬁguring the routers based on the
latest Security Guidelines.

Issue Description

1. Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation (CWE-79)

The Web management does not neutralize special characters in the error response. It
allows attackers to use a reﬂected XXS attack.

Severity: Score 4.3 (Medium), CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

Affected products: All Advantech industrial cellular routers with ﬁrmware 5.1.3 and
older. The issue was ﬁxed in version 5.2.0 (released in June 2015).

Also known as: CVE-2019-18233

2. Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information (CWE-319)

The Web management uses the unencrypted HTTP transmission and the Basic authen-
tication method. The login and password are transmitted in cleartext form, which can be
intercepted by attackers in the LAN. The Web management is not accessible over the
(cellular) WAN by default.

Severity: Score 9.8 (Critical), CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Mitigation: Users should disable the HTTP and always use the HTTPS instead. The
secured HTTPS transmission has been always enabled, even in the version 5.1.3.

SA-2021-01-01

Affected products: This affects all Advantech industrial cellular routers, which leave
HTTP enabled and use it for Web management. The HTTP has been disabled by default
since the version 6.2.0 (released in August 2019).

Also known as: CVE-2019-18231

3. Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307)

The Web management does not prevent brute-force attacks to guess the root password.

Severity: Score 9.8 (Critical), CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Mitigation: Since version 5.3.0 (released October 2015) the underlying Linux system
reports unsuccessful login attempts through the syslog service, so users may establish
a remote monitoring system to detect brute-force attack attempts.

Affected products: All Advantech industrial cellular routers with ﬁrmware 6.1.9 and
older. The brute-force attack protection has been implemented in version 6.1.10 (re-
leased in July 2019).

Also known as: CVE-2019-18235

4. Insufﬁciently Protected Credentials (CWE-522)

The Web management displays passwords for various services in a cleartext form, which
can be spotted by an authorized person. Also, this information can be transmitted using
the (unencrypted) HTTP protocol.

Severity: Score 6.8 (Medium), CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Affected products: All Advantech industrial cellular routers with ﬁrmware version 6.1.4
and older. The passwords are hidden (replaced by dots) since the ﬁrmware version 6.1.5
(released January 2018).

5. Usage of a Broken or Risky Cryptographic Algorithm (CWE-327)

The underlying Linux system uses an outdated DES hash algorithm (with salt) for pass-
word storage in the “/etc/passwd” ﬁle. The DES is considered insecure as cracking a
DES password can nowadays take about 3 days.

Severity: Score 7.0 (High), CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

Affected products: All Advantech industrial cellular routers with ﬁrmware version 5.2.1
and older. A more secure MD5 hash has been used since the ﬁrmware version 5.3.0
(released in October 2015) and since the ﬁrmware version 6.2.5 (released in June 2020)
the SHA256 hash is used instead.

Also known as: CVE-2019-18237

6. Using of vulnerable third-party software (CWE-1103)

The ﬁrmware version 5.1.3 (released in April 2015) uses the OpenSSL library version
1.0.1m and OpenSSH version 6.4.p1, which is affected by multiple vulnerabilities identi-
ﬁed in mainly in 2016.

Severity: 10.0 (Critical), CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

SA-2021-01-01

Mitigation: Advantech monitors and continuously updates third-party software, so the
latest ﬁrmware versions are free from third-party vulnerabilities. For security reasons the
users are strongly recommended to use always the latest ﬁrmware version.

Affected products: All Advantech industrial cellular routers with ﬁrmware 5.2.0 and
older. The ﬁrmware version 5.2.1 (released in July 2015) uses OpenSSL 1.0.1p and
OpenSSH 6.8p1. The most recent ﬁrmware version 6.2.7 (released in December 2020)
uses OpenSSL 1.1.1i and OpenSSH 8.0.

Also known as: CVE-2019-18239

Solution

The ﬁrmware version 6.1.10 (released in July 2019) addresses the reported vulnerabilities,

except all vulnerabilities in third-party software discovered after the release date.

Older ﬁrmware versions are always affected by vulnerabilities discovered after the release
It is therefore recommended to always use the latest ﬁrmware version. Advantech

date.
releases ﬁrmware updates at least four times each year.

Users are also recommended to review the latest Security Guidelines that provide harden-

ing recommendations, such as a suggestion to disable the plain HTTP transport.
