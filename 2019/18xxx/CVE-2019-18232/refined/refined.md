- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper link resolution before file access ('Link Following'). The software, when configured as a service, is vulnerable to symbolic link attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for the creation, writing, and/or deletion of files in system folders using symbolic links, leading to a privilege escalation. It can also be exploited to execute a malicious DLL.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Privilege escalation: A local attacker can gain higher privileges on the system.
    - Execution of malicious code: An attacker can execute malicious DLLs, potentially impacting the system's integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required for exploitation. The attack involves using symbolic links to manipulate file operations within system folders.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.
