- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The Application Server is vulnerable to remote code execution by sending specially crafted packets to port 1099/tcp.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the Application Server is required. Specifically crafted packets sent to port 1099/tcp are needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the Application Server.
