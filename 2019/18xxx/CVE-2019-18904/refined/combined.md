| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c0)  Ivan Kapelyukhin   2020-01-14 14:29:53 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 827518](attachment.cgi?id=827518 "migration_client.rb that reproduces the issue") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=827518&action=edit "migration_client.rb that reproduces the issue") migration_client.rb that reproduces the issue  When doing an offline migration from SLES 12 SP4 to SLES 15 SP1, the request to offline migrations endpoint times out and hangs RMT (stuck at 100% CPU load). During this time `zypper migration` dies with a timeout while waiting for the response.  It seems that this is due to the number of possible migrations exploding in the migration engine. The log shows thousands upon thousands of requests made to the DB.  I have attached migration_client.rb configured to reproduce the issue.  This is a major issue, as not only does it prevent the customer from migrating, but also brings down RMT. ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c1)  Thomas Schmidt   2020-01-14 14:33:55 UTC  ``` I think we fixed that in SCC, and forgot to patch RMT. Worth comparing the code of the migration engine. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c2)  Ivan Kapelyukhin   2020-01-14 14:36:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Thomas Schmidt from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c1)) > I think we fixed that in SCC, and forgot to patch RMT. Worth comparing the > code of the migration engine.  Yeah, I've looked at the code -- and it's different, the implementations have diverged at some point.  I'm not sure if I can fix it myself -- I can't really verify if it is producing the correct migration paths or not. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c3)  Ivan Kapelyukhin   2020-01-15 11:01:47 UTC  ``` We are seeing this issue in the wild:  > PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S  %CPU  %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND                                                                                                                                       > 73611 _rmt      20   0 1039944 223212   8048 S 100.0 2.744  55:11.87 rails   A single offline migrations request has been made:  > rmt-azure-1-australiaeast:/var/log/nginx # cat rmt_https_access.log | grep offline > 13.75.217.161 - SCC_9491d5b375df41fc8d486c36179e3668 [15/Jan/2020:10:04:50 +0000] "POST /connect/systems/products/offline_migrations HTTP/1.1" 499 0 "-" "SUSEConnect/0.3.16" > rmt-azure-1-australiaeast:/var/log/nginx # date > Wed Jan 15 10:52:09 UTC 2020  I'm bumping the priority on this bug. ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c4)  Thomas Hutterer   2020-01-15 11:20:38 UTC  ``` I made this a fastlane task in our team's Kanban: <https://trello.com/c/yGEzRyNK> We'll fix it asap! ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c5)  Ivan Kapelyukhin   2020-01-15 11:57:49 UTC  ``` Online migrations are also affected (the clients are catching read timeouts and are falling off, nginx uses HTTP code 499 for this):  rmt-ec2-1-eu-west-1b:  > 54.246.215.63 - SCC_ad7dfb5b99634b0db2fe34fa68d566e3 [15/Jan/2020:11:04:53 +0000] "POST /connect/systems/products/migrations HTTP/1.1" 499 0 "-" "SUSEConnect/0.3.11"  rmt-ec2-1-us-east-2c:  > 18.219.81.203 - SCC_f5b6a28ad01448bea01671a5b729736d [15/Jan/2020:03:42:42 +0000] "POST /connect/systems/products/migrations HTTP/1.1" 499 0 "-" "SUSEConnect/0.3.17" > 18.219.81.203 - SCC_f5b6a28ad01448bea01671a5b729736d [15/Jan/2020:03:58:13 +0000] "POST /connect/systems/products/migrations HTTP/1.1" 499 0 "-" "SUSEConnect/0.3.17" > 18.219.81.203 - SCC_f5b6a28ad01448bea01671a5b729736d [15/Jan/2020:04:08:59 +0000] "POST /connect/systems/products/migrations HTTP/1.1" 499 0 "-" "SUSEConnect/0.3.17"    Occasionally it seems to succeed, but I guess it depends on what kind of products are activated/in migration paths:  rmt-azure-3-westeurope-3:  > 51.144.187.210 - SCC_64c63ea85a66499ba12dc4d6d738c6f6 [15/Jan/2020:06:26:36 +0000] "POST /connect/systems/products/migrations HTTP/1.1" 200 4830 "-" "SUSEConnect/0.3.22" ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2020-01-17 13:10:01 UTC  ``` Please reference CVE-2019-18904 ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1160922#c8)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-30 11:18:04 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:0260-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has three fixes is now available.
