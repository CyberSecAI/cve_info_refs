Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8079:

**CVE-2019-8079:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unpatched Adobe Experience Manager (AEM) instance. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint where the `keymap` parameter is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** The `keymap` parameter in `/setPreferences.jsp` is vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Exposed `/crx/de` endpoint:** The AEM content repository endpoint `/crx/de` was publicly accessible. This is a misconfiguration that allows for the bypass of the AEM Dispatcher and access to internal AEM functionalities.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to:
        *   Session hijacking
        *   Defacement of the website
        *   Redirection to malicious sites
        *   Information theft
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **Direct access to vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker can directly access the `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint and inject the XSS payload via the `keymap` parameter.
    *  **Bypassing AEM Dispatcher:** Although the Dispatcher is meant to block access to such endpoints, the exposed `/crx/de` endpoint allows an attacker to bypass this protection.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable AEM instance.
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially due to the exposed endpoint.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The researcher initially used the '..;' AEM filter bypass to access the endpoint but later realized it wasn't necessary due to the exposed `/crx/de` endpoint.
*   The researcher tested with an HTML `<h1>` tag and then a JavaScript alert payload to confirm the XSS vulnerability.
*   The affected versions of AEM are 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 and 6.4, which matches the official description of the CVE.
*   The researcher reported this vulnerability to TCL, who initially considered it a low risk and offered a small bounty, which was declined.
