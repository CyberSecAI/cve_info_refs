The provided content describes a security vulnerability in the wtcms project, specifically a combination of CSRF and XSS vulnerabilities that can lead to administrator cookie theft.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **CSRF:**  The website's backend settings page lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
*   **XSS:** The website statistics code input field does not sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, submits a form that modifies the website settings, specifically the website statistics code.
*   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The website statistics code input allows the injection of JavaScript code, which is then executed in the context of the administrator's browser when they visit the site.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   By combining CSRF and XSS, an attacker can first use CSRF to inject malicious JavaScript into the site's statistics code. When the administrator visits the site's homepage, this malicious JavaScript executes and can be used to steal the administrator's session cookie. The attacker can then use this cookie to gain full administrative access to the web site.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **CSRF:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that targets the vulnerable settings page. This page is then sent to the administrator through a social engineering method.
*   **XSS:** Once the administrator clicks the link and the form is submitted, the malicious javascript is stored in the site's settings. When the administrator visits the front page, the stored XSS payload executes in the administrator's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to convince the administrator to click a malicious link which submits a crafted form to the web site.
*   The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTML and Javascript.
