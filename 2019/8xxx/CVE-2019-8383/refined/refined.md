{
  "CVE-2019-8383": {
    "Description": "Denial of service in function adv_png_unfilter_8 in lib/png.c",
    "Root cause": "The advancecomp PNG library doesn't validate the image size, leading to an integer overflow when decoding PNG header data. The overflown value is used for memory allocation and access, causing heap-based overflow leading to improper data reading or DoS due to invalid memory access.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Improper memory access",
	  "Lack of image size validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (Segmentation fault), potentially unspecified other impact from improper data read.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted PNG file provided as input.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Ability to provide a crafted PNG file to the vulnerable program."
  }
