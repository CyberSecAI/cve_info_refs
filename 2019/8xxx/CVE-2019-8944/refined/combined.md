## Description

![@mcasperson](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160104?v=4&size=48)[mcasperson](https://github.com/mcasperson)opened [on Feb 19, 2019](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/5314#issue-412164560)

Sensitive Terraform output variables are saved and exposed as regular variables, and printed in the logs.

For example, if you deploy the following Terraform template:

```
{"output":{"test":{"sensitive": true, "value": "hi"}}}

```

The value `hi` would appear in the logs.

## Description

![@mcasperson](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/160104?v=4&size=48)[mcasperson](https://github.com/mcasperson)opened [on Feb 19, 2019](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/5315#issue-412167072)

Sensitive Terraform output variables are saved and exposed as regular variables, and printed in the logs.

For example, if you deploy the following Terraform template:

```
{"output":{"test":{"sensitive": true, "value": "hi"}}}

```

The value `hi` would appear in the logs.
