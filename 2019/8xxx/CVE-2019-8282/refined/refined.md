  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Gemalto Admin Control Center uses cleartext HTTP to communicate with www3.safenet-inc.com to obtain language packs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cleartext communication",
    "Man-in-the-middle vulnerability"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack and replace the original language pack with a malicious one.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based man-in-the-middle attack",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Gemalto Admin Control Center and www3.safenet-inc.com.  The attacker has to be able to inject malicious responses to the request for the language pack."
