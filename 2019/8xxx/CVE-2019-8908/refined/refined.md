The provided content relates to CVE-2019-8908.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient file extension validation during image uploads in the "Registration email template" editor within the WTcms application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The editor allows uploading files with arbitrary extensions by manipulating the "Suffix" during the upload process, bypassing intended file type restrictions.
- Lack of server-side validation: There is a lack of server-side validation or sanitization of uploaded files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By uploading a file with a malicious extension (e.g., .php, .jsp), an attacker could execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- Complete System Compromise: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain control over the web server and potentially the entire system.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Request Manipulation: The attack is performed by intercepting the file upload request using a tool like Burp Suite and changing the file suffix to an executable file format.
- Backstage Editor: The vulnerability is specifically triggered through the image upload feature in the "Registration email template" editor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the WTcms application's administration panel.
- Ability to modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a proxy tool like Burp Suite).
- A malicious file that can be executed by the server.
