Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-8288:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied data before displaying it on the `user_view.php` page. Specifically, the `adidas_member_user` variable is not sanitized when echoed to the HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. This occurs because user input is stored and then rendered back without proper encoding or sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into user fields (like login name or email), which will then be executed in the context of an administrative user's browser when they access the user panel.
*   **Cookie stealing:** The provided description specifically mentions cookie stealing as a possible impact, allowing attackers to hijack administrator sessions.
*   **Account compromise:** By stealing cookies or executing malicious code, attackers can potentially compromise administrative accounts and gain full control over the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious User Input:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the login information form.
*   **User Panel Access:**  The attack is triggered when an administrative user navigates to the user panel page (`user_view.php`) displaying the unsanitized input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to register:** The attacker must be able to create a new user account and provide malicious data during registration or user profile update.
*   **Passive waiting:** The attacker does not need to interact directly with the administrative user. The exploit is triggered when the admin browses to the user panel.

**Technical Details**

* Code snippet from user\_view.php: `echo '<td>'.$row['adidas_member_user'].'</td>';`  This line is vulnerable because the value of the  `$row['adidas_member_user']` is directly echoed without sanitization.
*  The exploit code provided sets the login name or email to "><script>alert(1);</script>"
