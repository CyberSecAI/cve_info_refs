Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. SQL Injection in `skins/classic/views/events.php` (line 44):**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization of the `$_REQUEST['filter']` parameter when used in SQL queries. Specifically, the `cnj` and `obr` values within the filter terms are directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious `filter` parameter in a GET request, an attacker can inject SQL code into the `countSql` or `eventsSql` queries.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web page. The provided POC uses a GET request to achieve the injection.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The `parseFilter` function processes the `$_REQUEST['filter']` parameter.
    *   In older versions (before 1.32.3), the `sql` parameter came from `$filter['terms'][$i]['cnj']` or `$filter['terms'][$i]['obr']`.
    *   In version 1.32.3, the relevant part of the code uses `$terms[$i]['cnj']`, which comes from `$filter['Query']['terms']`.
    *   The provided PoC for version 1.32.3 uses the `filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]` parameter to inject the SQL payload.

**2. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to SQL query errors:**

*   **Root Cause:** When a SQL query fails, the error message, including the raw SQL query string, is displayed on the page without proper sanitization or output encoding.
*  **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of user-supplied input when rendering a web page ('Reflected XSS').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to the compromise of user accounts, data theft, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** By injecting malicious SQL syntax into the vulnerable parameter, an attacker forces a SQL error, displaying the crafted payload within the error message on the page.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web page and inject malicious SQL syntax.
*   **Technical Details:** The vulnerability exists in `includes/database.php` on line 120. The error message includes the SQL query which is not sanitized. The provided PoC uses the filter parameter, similar to the SQL injection to trigger an error containing the XSS payload.

**3. Second-Order SQL Injection in `skins/classic/views/control.php` (line 35):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$groupSql` parameter used in the SQL query is retrieved directly from the database without any sanitization. This parameter is initially inserted into the database via the `includes/action.php` on line 748 using the `monitors` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*  **Attack Vector:** By first inserting a malicious SQL payload into the `monitors` table via a crafted request to `index.php?action=group` and then triggering the vulnerable query in `control.php` with a specific group ID, the attacker can inject SQL code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web pages and needs to be able to create groups.
*   **Technical Details:** The `$groupSql` parameter in `control.php` is vulnerable because it's retrieved from the database without sanitization. The malicious SQL payload is initially inserted through the `action=group` endpoint, specifically within the `newGroup[MonitorIds]` parameter.

**4. Reflected XSS in `skins/classic/views/controlcap.php`:**

*   **Root Cause:** Multiple variables in `controlcap.php`, including  `newControl[MinTiltRange]` , are not filtered, and are directly rendered on the page.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of user-supplied input when rendering a web page ('Reflected XSS').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to the compromise of user accounts, data theft, or other client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** By including a malicious JavaScript payload within parameters such as `newControl[MinTiltRange]` in a GET request, an attacker can achieve XSS.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web page, crafting GET parameters with the malicious payload.
*   **Technical Details:**  The file renders parameters directly into HTML context. The provided PoC demonstrates this issue with the `newControl[MinTiltRange]` parameter.

**5. Command Injection in `includes/functions.php` (daemonControl):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `daemonControl` function directly passes unfiltered user-controlled input to a system shell command.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command ('OS Command Injection').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the parameters passed to the `daemonControl` function, an attacker can inject and execute malicious shell commands.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `daemonControl` function with malicious parameters.
*   **Technical Details:** The function uses unfiltered parameters when calling the shell.

**6. SQL Injection in `ajax/status.php` (line 276 - orderby):**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `sort` parameter is directly used in the `ORDER BY` clause of an SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection').
*  **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code within the `ORDER BY` clause.
*   **Attack Vector:** By including a malicious SQL payload within the `sort` parameter, an attacker can achieve SQL injection.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint and control the `sort` parameter.
*   **Technical Details:** The code does not sanitize the `sort` parameter, allowing for SQL injection within the `ORDER BY` clause.

**7. SQL Injection in `ajax/status.php` (lines 393 and 406):**

*   **Root Cause:** The `filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without sanitization.
*   **Weakness:** Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command ('SQL Injection').
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious `filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]` parameter in a GET request, an attacker can inject SQL code.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable web page.
*   **Technical Details:** This vulnerability is similar to the first SQL injection, but occurs in a different part of the codebase. The code uses unfiltered `filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]` to construct the query.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in ZoneMinder versions prior to 1.32.3, including SQL injection, reflected XSS, second-order SQL injection, command injection, and lack of sanitization in multiple areas of the application. The primary causes are a lack of proper input sanitization and validation, particularly when constructing SQL queries and rendering output to the user.
