- **Root cause:** A logic issue in Archive Utility was addressed with improved validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** A sandboxed process could circumvent sandbox restrictions due to a logic error in validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A sandboxed process could bypass sandbox restrictions.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires a sandboxed process to interact with the vulnerable component (Archive Utility).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a sandboxed process running on the affected system.
