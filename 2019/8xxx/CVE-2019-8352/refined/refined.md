{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The BMC PATROL Agent uses a static encryption key by default for encrypting and decrypting user credentials sent over the network.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of a static encryption key"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who captures network traffic can decrypt user credentials. These credentials can then be used for code execution or privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network traffic capture"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic to exploit this vulnerability.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in BMC PATROL Agent versions 11.3.01 and prior. It is also mentioned that the agent provides the ability to change the key in use by setting the 'PATROL_USER_MSKF' environmental variable or saving the custom key in '/etc/.psk/userk'. Additionally, enabling SSL/TLS can mitigate the vulnerability although it is disabled by default."
