Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flawed logic in the `upload.php` script of the `upload-image-with-ajax` application. The script checks if a file is an image based on its MIME type and extension. However, it subsequently overwrites the check result if the file size is below 1MB, setting a `$ready` flag to true regardless of whether the file is actually an image. This allows an attacker to bypass the image type check by uploading any file type with a size less than 1MB.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure File Upload:** The primary weakness is the inadequate validation of uploaded files, leading to arbitrary file upload. The file type check can be bypassed, allowing the upload of non-image files.
- **Logical Error:** The conditional logic for file validation is flawed, as it prioritizes file size over file type, allowing a bypass of the file type validation.
- **Missing Error Handling:** While some error handling exists, it's insufficient to prevent malicious uploads, especially with the logic flaws mentioned above.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP file (or any other executable type), an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server. In the provided exploit example, the attacker uploads a PHP shell, enabling them to execute system commands on the server.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete server compromise, allowing attackers to steal data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to the `upload.php` script with a crafted multipart/form-data request, simulating a file upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable server.
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specific HTTP POST request including a malicious payload with a file size under 1MB.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must know the location of the `upload.php` script on the target server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates the vulnerability by uploading a PHP shell disguised as a JPEG file (`shell.jpg`).
- The fix for this vulnerability involves adding an exit command after the file size check fails, preventing execution flow to the upload and by not setting `$ready = true;` if the check fails.
