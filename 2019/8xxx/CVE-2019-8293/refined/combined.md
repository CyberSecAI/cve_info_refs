    CVE-ID:[CVE-2019-8292]
    Download Site: <https://github.com/abcprintf/upload-image-with-ajax/>

    Advisory: <http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=211>
    Description: upload-image-with-ajax
    Vulnerability:
    The code below changes the $ready flag to true if the file conforms to the size of < 1000000. Reversing the check that the file is an image. So, a .php file can be uploaded with only a warning allowing code execution.

    $ready = false;
    if((($imageType == "image/jpeg") || ($imageType == "image/jpg") || ($imageType == "image/png"))&&in_array($fileExt, $validext)){
    $ready = true;
    }else{
    echo "was not an image
    ";
    /You should abort the upload right here/
    }
    if($_FILES["fileUpload"]["size"] < 1000000){
    $ready = true;
    echo "file size is ".$_FILES['fileUpload']["size"]."
    ";
    }else{
    echo "file was TOO BIG!";
    }

     $ ./fileupload_exploit 192.168.0.3 80 /upload-image-with-ajax/upload.php
