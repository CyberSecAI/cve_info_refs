- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in the Wi-Fi driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper validation in the Wi-Fi driver, leading to potential modification of its state.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with a privileged network position can modify the Wi-Fi driver's state.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker positioned on a privileged network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a privileged network position to intercept or modify network traffic and interact with the Wi-Fi driver.
