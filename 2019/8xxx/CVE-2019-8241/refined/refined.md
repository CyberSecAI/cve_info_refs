Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-8241

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing MOV files in Adobe Media Encoder. This leads to an out-of-bounds read condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read, where the software attempts to read memory beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information in the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially access data that the user has access to.
*   **Potential for further exploitation:** The advisory also notes that this vulnerability could be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker could craft a malicious MOV file.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page for the exploit to work.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious MOV file to the victim, or trick the victim into loading a malicious MOV file through other means (e.g., a website).
*   No special privileges on the victim machine are required to exploit the vulnerability. The attack is executed with the privileges of the user running Adobe Media Encoder.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Adobe Media Encoder version 13.1 and earlier.
*   Adobe has released a fix in version 14.0.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Adobe by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
* The CVSS score is 3.3 with vector AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N indicating a low severity issue that requires local access, user interaction and resulting in limited confidentiality impact.
