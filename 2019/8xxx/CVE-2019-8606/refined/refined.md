- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A validation issue existed in the handling of symlinks within the IOKit framework.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper validation of symlinks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local user may be able to load unsigned kernel extensions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel.
- **Attack vectors**: A local user can exploit the vulnerability by manipulating symlinks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local user access to the system.
