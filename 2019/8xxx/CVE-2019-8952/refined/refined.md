Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-8952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue located in the webserver of the affected products.
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation, allowing the attacker to specify paths outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-28**: Path Traversal. Specifically, the vulnerability is described as "Path Traversal: '..\filedir'".

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can remotely traverse the file system to access files and directories outside the restricted area.
- This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network via the web server's HTTP/HTTPS interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the webserver (HTTP/HTTPS) of the affected device.
- The attacker requires valid user credentials to authenticate to the webserver before exploitation is possible.

**Affected Products:**
*   **Hardware:**
    *   Bosch DIVAR IP 2000 (Vulnerable Versions: 3.10, 3.20, 3.21, 3.50, 3.51, 3.55, 3.60, 3.61, 3.62; Fixed Versions: 3.62.0019 and newer)
    *   Bosch DIVAR IP 5000 (Vulnerable Versions: 3.10, 3.20, 3.21, 3.50, 3.51, 3.55, 3.60, 3.61, 3.62; Fixed Version: 3.80.0033 and newer)
*   **Software:**
    *   Video Recording Manager (VRM) (Vulnerable Versions: 3.10, 3.20, 3.21, 3.50, 3.51, 3.55, 3.60, 3.61, 3.62, 3.70, 3.71 except 3.71.0032 and newer; Fixed Versions: 3.71.0032, 3.81.0032 and newer)
    *   Bosch Video Management System (BVMS) (See table provided in the content for specific vulnerable and fixed VRM versions per BVMS version).

**Mitigation:**
- The primary solution is to update to the fixed versions of the affected software.
- As a mitigation, it is recommended to firewall devices to limit their exposure, and specifically not to expose them directly to the internet.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by an external researcher, Adrián Quirós Godoy.
- There was no indication that exploitation code was publicly known at the time of the advisory publication.
- The vulnerability resides in the software since version 3.10 and was fixed in version 3.80 or higher for DIVAR IP products and 3.71.0032 or higher for VRM software
