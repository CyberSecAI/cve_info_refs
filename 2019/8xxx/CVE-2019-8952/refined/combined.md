## Summary

A recently discovered security vulnerability affects several Bosch software applications and hardware systems. It potentially allows, after authorization, the access to arbitrary files on the system via the network interface. Bosch rates this vulnerability at CVSS v3.0 4.9 (Medium) and recommends customers to upgrade devices with fixed software versions.

As of 2019-04-04, updated firmware files are published on the Bosch Download Area (
[Link](https://downloadstore.boschsecurity.com/)
).

As of 2019-04-04, there is currently no indication that the exploitation code is either publicly known or utilized.

If a software update is not possible in a timely manner, a reduction in the systems network exposure is advised. Internet-accessible systems should be firewalled, whilst additional steps like network isolation by VLAN, IP filtering features of the devices and other technologies should be used to decrease the exposure of vulnerable devices.

The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to Bosch by the external researcher AdriÃ¡n QuirÃ³s Godoy.

| 8.0 | 3.70.0056 | 3.71.0032 |
| 9.0 | 3.81.0032 (Not vulnerable) | |

## Solution

### Software Updates

The recommended approach is to update the software of affected Bosch Products to a fixed version. If an update is not possible in a timely manner, the mitigation approach Firewalling can be utilized. A list of affected devices and fixed software versions is available in the âAffected Productsâ chapter of this document.

### Mitigations and Workarounds

**Firewalling (Network)**

It is advised that the devices should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes port-forwarding, which would not protect devices adequately. Firewalling a device significantly reduces its attack surface.

## Vulnerability Details

### Vulnerability Classification and Solution Approach

This vulnerability is classified as âPath Traversalâ and is located in the webserver. It is accordingly ranked as âCWE-28: Path Traversal: â..\filedirââ. The server fix utilizes additional input neutralization checks. The vulnerability resides in the software since version 3.10. The vulnerability is fixed in version 3.80 or higher. Prior versions are considered unaffected.

* [CWE-28](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/28.html)
  : Path Traversal: â..\filedirâ
  + The CVSS V3 Base Score is rated at: 4.9 (Medium)
    [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

The vulnerability can be used to remotely traverse through the file system to access files or directories that are outside of the restricted directory. This would enable a potential attacker, for example, to access restricted files on the target system. A necessary prerequisite for this attack is the network access to the webserver (HTTP / HTTPS) of the device and valid user credentials. An affected system should be secured by updating to a fixed version and changing passwords.

Vulnerability classification has been performed using the CVSSv3 scoring system
[(http://www.first.org/cvss/)](http://www.first.org/cvss/)
.
The CVSS environmental score is specific to each customerâs environment and should be defined by the customer to attain a final scoring.

## Summary

A recently discovered security vulnerability affects several Bosch software applications and hardware systems. It potentially allows, after authorization, the access to arbitrary files on the system via the network interface. Bosch rates this vulnerability at CVSS v3.0 4.9 (Medium) and recommends customers to upgrade devices with fixed software versions.

As of 2019-04-04, updated firmware files are published on the Bosch Download Area (
[Link](https://downloadstore.boschsecurity.com/)
).

As of 2019-04-04, there is currently no indication that the exploitation code is either publicly known or utilized.

If a software update is not possible in a timely manner, a reduction in the systems network exposure is advised. Internet-accessible systems should be firewalled, whilst additional steps like network isolation by VLAN, IP filtering features of the devices and other technologies should be used to decrease the exposure of vulnerable devices.

The vulnerability was discovered and responsibly disclosed to Bosch by the external researcher AdriÃ¡n QuirÃ³s Godoy.
