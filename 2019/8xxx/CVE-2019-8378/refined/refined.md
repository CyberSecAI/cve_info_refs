CVE-2019-8378:
- Vulnerability: Heap-based buffer overflow
- Location: AP4_BitStream::ReadBytes() in Ap4BitStream.cpp in Bento4 version 1.5.1-628
- Cause: The vulnerability is triggered within the AP4_CopyMemory() function due to a negative value in byte_count, leading to an attempt to copy a negative number of bytes, resulting in a heap-buffer-overflow. Specifically, the condition `byte_count > 0` is not checked before proceeding with memory copy.
- Impact: Denial of Service (segmentation fault), potentially leading to unspecified other impacts.
- Attack vector: Sending a crafted AAC file to the aac2mp4 binary.
- Exploitability: An attacker can cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified impacts by sending a specially crafted file to the aac2mp4 binary.
- Proof of Concept: Provided
