Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-8292:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `delete_product.php` script in the "Online store system" does not check if the user has administrative privileges before allowing them to delete a product from the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing authorization check:** The application lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive operations like product deletion.
- **Unauthenticated product deletion:** Any user, even without administrative access, can delete products through the `delete_product.php` script.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Data loss:** Attackers can delete products from the database, potentially disrupting the online store's functionality and causing data loss.
- **Service disruption:** The deletion of products could lead to a denial-of-service condition, making it difficult for legitimate customers to use the online store.
- **Reputational damage:** Unauthorized product deletion can damage the online store's reputation and erode customer trust.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct request to `delete_product.php`:** An attacker can directly send a request to the `delete_product.php` script with a product ID to delete a product.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the application.
- **Knowledge of product IDs:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess product IDs to target specific products for deletion.

**Additional notes:**
- The exploit code provided in the advisory demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
- The advisory also mentions other vulnerabilities in the same application, including stored XSS and arbitrary file deletion, which are identified by different CVE IDs.
- The `upload-image-with-ajax` vulnerability and its subsequent correction are related to CVE-2019-8293, not CVE-2019-8292
