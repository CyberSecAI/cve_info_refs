| **Description:** "Online store system" is a drop in customizable electronic storefront. It has an administrative interface allowing user and product management. |
| **Vulnerability:**The application contains stored XSS vulnerabilities throughout the form user\_view.php pages as none of the variables are sanitized before being presented back to the client.

CVE-2019-8288 159 echo '<td>'.$row['adidas\_member\_user'].'</td>'; CVE-2019-8289 160 echo '<td>'. $row['adidas\_member\_email'] . '</td>'; CVE-2019-8290 The registration form requirements for the member email format can be bypassed by posting directly to sent\_register.php allowing special characters to be included and an XSS payload to be injected. CVE-2019-8291 The code in delete\_file.php doesn't check to see if a user has administrative rights nor does it check for path traversal allowing a '..' to delete arbitrary files owned by the httpd process. CVE-2019-8292 The code in delete\_product.php doesn't check to see if a user has administrative rights before allowing them to delete a product from the database. |

Description: upload-image-with-ajax
Vulnerability:
The code below changes the $ready flag to true if the file conforms to the size of < 1000000. Reversing the check that the file is an image. So, a .php file can be uploaded with only a warning allowing code execution.

$ready = false;

$ready = true;
}else{
echo "was not an image
";
/You should abort the upload right here/
}
if($_FILES["fileUpload"]["size"] < 1000000){
$ready = true;
echo "file size is ".$_FILES['fileUpload']["size"]."
";
}else{
echo "file was TOO BIG!";
}

    Title: Arbitrary file upload vulnerability in upload-image-with-ajax

    CVE-ID:[CVE-2019-8292]

    Vendor: adcprintf

    Advisory: <http://www.vapidlabs.com/advisory.php?v=211>
    Description: upload-image-with-ajax
    Vulnerability:
    The code below changes the $ready flag to true if the file conforms to the size of < 1000000. Reversing the check that the file is an image. So, a .php file can be uploaded with only a warning allowing code execution.

    $ready = false;
    if((($imageType == "image/jpeg") || ($imageType == "image/jpg") || ($imageType == "image/png"))&&in_array($fileExt, $validext)){
    $ready = true;
    }else{
    echo "was not an image
    ";
    /You should abort the upload right here/
    }
    if($_FILES["fileUpload"]["size"] < 1000000){
    $ready = true;
    echo "file size is ".$_FILES['fileUpload']["size"]."
    ";
    }else{
    echo "file was TOO BIG!";
    }
