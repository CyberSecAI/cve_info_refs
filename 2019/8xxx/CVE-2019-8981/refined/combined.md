New critical remote buffer overflow vulnerability
in axTLS TLS record size parsing
(CVE-2019-8981)
by Robert Hörr (e-mail: robert.hoerr@t-systems.com)
(Security Evaluator of the Telekom Security Evaluation Facility)

A new critical remote buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2019-8981) in the axTLS library for
embedded  devices  (version  2.1.4,  http://axtls.sourceforge.net)  was  discovered  on  2019
February  20  by  Telekom  Security  Experts  with  modern  fuzzing  methods,  which  possibly
allows remote code executions. A new fixed version (2.1.5) countering this is now available
for download (https://sourceforge.net/projects/axtls/files/2.1.5/).

What is the axTLS library?
The axTLS library is an open source project providing a TLS implementation (like the well-
known  open  source  project  openssl)  for  embedded  devices.  The  library  has  been
downloaded 1,839 times since July 2017 and is used in commercial products.
The advantages of the library are the small size of the source code and the small number
of features compared to openssl. These advantages do not automatically mean that axTLS
has less vulnerabilities than openssl, because this depends on multiple factors like coding
style, reviews, testing, distribution and so on.

Why was the axTLS library fuzzed?
Some security devices use the axTLS library to secure their network traffic with TLS. The
task  of  the  Security  Evaluators  of  the  Evaluation  Facility  is  to  check  the  IT-Security  of
security  devices  according  to  a  security  scheme  like  Payment  Card  Industry  or Common
Criteria. These  security  schemes  require  among  other things  testing  the  security  devices
with  fuzzing  methods  to  find  vulnerabilities  like  buffer  overflows.  The  reason  for  using
fuzzing  additionally  to  e.g.  source  code  review  is  i.a.  that  source  codes  are  becoming
bigger and more complex.

How was the axTLS library fuzzed?
Our  fuzzing  approach  is  code  coverage  based  fuzzing  (which  is  also  used  by  AFL  and
LibFuzzer)  combined  with  the AdressSanitizer  that  was  used  to  find  all  buffer  overflows.
The LibFuzzer was  also used to fuzz the axTLS library.  In order to use the LibFuzzer an
interface between the fuzzer and the axTLS library is needed. This interface includes the
functions of the axTLS library which one would like to fuzz.

Where is the vulnerability located in the source code?
The  vulnerability  is  explained  based  on  the  source  code  sections  in  the  appendix  of  this
blog  article.  The  bold  marked  source  code  lines  are  important  for  understanding.  The
following  enumeration  describes  the  vulnerability  step  by  step.  The  number  of  the
corresponding  enumeration  can  be  found  in  the  bold  marked  source  code  lines  as  a
comment to understand the enumeration (e.g. //step1).

1.  The pointer buf of the function basic_read points to the array bm_all_data with the

size 17408 (16384+1024).

2.  The function SOCKET_READ writes new data to buf at index ssl→bm_read_index

with size ssl→need_bytes - ssl→got_bytes.

3.  Only  if  all  of  the  needed  bytes  ssl→need_bytes  are  received,  the  function

basic_read will be executed further ( if(ssl->got_bytes < ssl→need_bytes) ).

4.  The  variable  ssl->need_bytes  gets  the  record  length,  which  can  be  greater  than
17408  e.g.  65535,  because  the  record  length  of  the TLS  protocol  is  coded  in  two
bytes.

5.  If

ssl→need_bytes  will  not  be  reset.  Hence  the  variable  ssl→need_bytes  keeps  the
value greater than 17408.

greater

is
be

but

6.  By  the  next  function  calls  of  basic_read  the  variable  ssl->got_bytes  tries  to  reach

the value of the variable ssl→need_bytes (see 3.).

7.  If  the  variable  ssl→got_bytes  reaches  the  value  17408,  the  buffer  buf  will  be
overflowed  with  up  to  48127  bytes  by  the  function  SOCKET_READ  (see  2.).
AddressSanitizer detects a heap-buffer-overflow.

How is the vulnerability exploitable by an attacker?
An attacker sends a TLS packet with a record length of 65535 in the TLS record header.
The first  and  next  transmitted TLS packets are  in  sum 17408 bytes  of  e.g.  random  data.
Now the buffer buf is completely full and the next received TLS data are stored outside of
buf.  Hence  the  attacker  can  send  48127  bytes  to  change  the  behavior  of  the  system  or
TLS. Possibly the attacker can perform a remote code execution attack.

What do we learn from this?
Code coverage based fuzzing combined with the AddressSanitizer is a powerful method to
find e.g. buffer overflows. With increasingly complex source codes it is a resource-efficient
alternative  to  source  code  reviews,  because  this  fuzzing  approach  can  be  done  mainly
automatically. As there exist many approaches for fuzzing, it is the art of fuzzing to find the
best approach.

Variant of Satori/Mirai detected attacking public available ADB shells

10 July 2018

On the 10th of July at 23:30 UTC we noticed an increased traffic on our blackhole monitoring on TCP port 5555. Upon further analyzation, we saw a big chunk of this traffic coming from China, USA and the Dominican Republic. In total we gathered 246.434 packets from 68.361 unique IPs. Based on the packet details we gathered, we can assume that the packets were generated by a lot of different devices. In addition, the traffic behavior on port 555 matches the typicall scan behavior of botnets.

Kaltura Video Platform - Pre-Auth Remote Code Execution (and XSS)

12 Sep 2017

During an interal pentest several critical vulnerabilities could be identified in the latest version of Kaltura Community and Enterprise. The vulnerabilities were fixed in the latest release 13.2.0.
A proof of concept exploit may be released later, giving time for users to patch.

By misuse of several processor bugs it is possible to break up the separation between the kernel and user space.

## Deutsche Telekom CERT Assessment

On Intel CPU driven platforms, it is possible for normal user programs to gather information about protected kernel memory areas (“Meltdown attack”, CVE-2017-5754) [1] [2].  This results in an information leakage between kernel and user space.

This vulnerability affects every Intel CPU produced in the past decade (CPUs since 1995 except Itanium and pre-2013 Atoms). The in [3] listed ARM cores are also affected by this vulnerability.

A further issue is described in the “Spectre attack” (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715). Spectre allows a user-mode application to extract information from other processes or VMs to access memory of other VMs. This vulnerability affects all listed Intel CPUs, as well as AMD’s Ryzen, FX and Pro families and several ARM Cortex cores listed in [3].

Official disclosure for Spectre and Meltdown took place on 2018-01-04 [10].

To exploit both vulnerabilities an attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

Thus, up to now network components like routers, switches, firewalls, mobiles or CPEs don’t provide enough attack surface for exploitation even if they are affected. On most network components it is very difficult to run attacker crafted code because they’ve never been designed to run custom code.

## Recommendations

* Apply patches as soon as they are available from the respective supplier
  (for Microsoft desktop systems check availability with AV vendors [13])
* Top priority should be patching of (see timeline below)
  o   hypervisors of cloud systems
  o   operating systems of desktop clients and virtual/remote desktop systems
  o   operating systems of hosting platforms
* On XEN hypervisors:
  o   Enable “supervisor mode execute protection” if possible
  o   Evaluate if XEN VMs can be run in HVM or PVM mode (only PV hosting hypervisors are affected)
* For network components
  o   Even if an attack is unlikely ask your vendor if your device is vulnerable and needs patching

**Patch Prioritization**

In general high priority patching is advised for every machine which runs untrusted code from third parties. On shared and exclusive private clouds there is less risk because these platforms are dedicated to trusted customers. On all other servers it is unlikely that an attacker is able to run arbitrary code. Patch your system based on local patch cycles.

Due to the complexity of the attack it is unlikely that smartphones get exploited.

**Patch Availability**

* Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, 10 [5]
  o   McAfee is now patch compatible [12]
  o   Further AV vendors can be found in [13]
  o   A registry key has to be set. Without the key the client doesn’t fetch the update. See [5].
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, Server Version 1709 Attention: The mitigation has to be enabled via registry [6]
* Mac OS X 10.13.1 (10.13.2 isn’t vulnerable)
* Several Suse Linux and RHEL distributions [7] [8]
* VMware ESXi 5.5 to 6.5, Workstation 12.X and 14.X, Fusion 8.X [9]
* Android (patchlevel 2018-01-05)
* iOS (patchlevel 11.2)

Linux Kernel patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-09.

IBM AIX patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-12 [11].

There is no announcement for a SOLARIS patch, we are in touch with Oracle.
