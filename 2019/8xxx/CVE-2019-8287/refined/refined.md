Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8287:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow within the `HandleCoRREBPP` macro function in TightVNC. This function is responsible for handling the "CoRRE" (Copy Rectangular Region Encoding) data, which involves copying a rectangular region of the screen.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow'):** The `HandleCoRREBPP` macro doesn't properly validate the size of the data being copied to the global buffer. Specifically, the `nSubrects` field, controlled by the remote user, is multiplied by a constant size to calculate the total amount of data to be read, which can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the global buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** The buffer overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the vulnerable system. By overwriting critical data in memory, an attacker may be able to control the program's execution flow.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Although not explicitly stated, a buffer overflow can also cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network connection. An attacker can send a crafted RFB (Remote Frame Buffer) message to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the vulnerable VNC server (TightVNC) over a network connection.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any authentication requirements.

**Technical Details:**
- The `buffer` is defined with a fixed size (640 * 480 bytes).
- The `ReadFromRFBServer` function attempts to read `hdr.nSubrects * (4 + (BPP / 8))` bytes into the buffer where `hdr.nSubrects` is a 32-bit unsigned integer controlled by the attacker.
- If the product of `hdr.nSubrects` and `(4 + (BPP / 8))` exceeds the buffer's size, a buffer overflow will occur.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability exists in TightVNC version 1.3.10.
- The vulnerable code originated from code written by AT&T Laboratories in 1999 and copy-pasted into various VNC implementations.
- The vulnerability is also known as CVE-2018-20020 in libvncserver context.
