- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Hasplm` cookie lacks the `HTTPOnly` attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The absence of the `HTTPOnly` attribute in the `Hasplm` cookie allows malicious JavaScript to access and potentially steal the cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows malicious JavaScript to steal the cookie, which could lead to unauthorized access or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is carried out remotely by injecting malicious JavaScript, which requires user interaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript, and the user has to interact with the malicious script, likely through a website or application.
