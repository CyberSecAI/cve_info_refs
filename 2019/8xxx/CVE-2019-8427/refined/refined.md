Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities Identified:**

1.  **SQL Injection in `skins/classic/views/events.php` (line 44):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `$_REQUEST['filter']` parameter, specifically the `cnj` or `obr` values within the nested `terms` array, are directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization. The vulnerable code is located within the `parseFilter` function which is called within `skins/classic/views/events.php`.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and parameterized queries.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By manipulating the `filter` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
    *   **Details:**  The provided PoC demonstrates the injection by manipulating the `filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]` parameter and using a time-based SQL injection payload. It also notes how the vulnerable variables changed between versions 1.32.0 and 1.32.3.

2.  **Reflected XSS via SQL Error Messages:**
    *   **Root Cause:**  When an SQL query results in an error, the raw error message (including the injected SQL) is displayed without any encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding and error handling.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious SQL into parameters that cause an SQL error.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and inject SQL.
    *   **Details:** The PoC demonstrates the injection using a crafted SQL statement within the filter parameters.

3.  **Second-Order SQL Injection in `skins/classic/views/control.php` (line 35):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `$groupSql` variable is fetched from the database and used directly in an SQL query without sanitization. The variable is initially inserted into the database via an insecure `action=group` request.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization when initially writing the value to the database and output sanitization when reading it from the database.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, with similar impact as the first SQL Injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** First, inject malicious SQL code into the database via the group creation functionality. Then, trigger the vulnerable SQL query by accessing the affected page.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and interact with the group creation functionality.
    *   **Details:**  The PoC involves injecting a malicious SQL fragment into the `newGroup[MonitorIds]` parameter during group creation which is then fetched from the database and executed later.

4.  **Reflected XSS in `skins/classic/views/controlcap.php`:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Various parameters in `controlcap.php`, such as `newControl[MinTiltRange]`, are directly displayed on the page without proper encoding.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output encoding.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to actions similar to the previous XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating parameters in the URL.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
    *    **Details:** The PoC demonstrates injecting an XSS payload into the  `newControl[MinTiltRange]` parameter.

5. **Command Injection in `includes/functions.php` (daemonControl):**
    *  **Root Cause:** Unspecified parameters to the `daemonControl` function are passed unsanitized to a shell command.
     *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  By manipulating parameters passed to the vulnerable function, potentially through the web interface.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:**  Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and access the vulnerable function.
   *  **Details:** The description is brief without a specific PoC, but it indicates a command injection vulnerability.

6. **SQL Injection in `ajax/status.php` (line 276):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `sort` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query's `ORDER BY` clause without sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization.
    *  **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code. The impact is similar to the previous SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating the `sort` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
   * **Details:** The provided PoC demonstrates injecting a value into the `sort` parameter, and uses a time-based SQL injection payload.

7. **SQL Injection in `ajax/status.php` (line 393 and 406):**
    *   **Root Cause:** Similar to the first SQL injection, parameters within the `filter` parameter are directly used in the SQL query without sanitization. This vulnerability is present in multiple lines in the `ajax/status.php` file.
     *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code. The impact is similar to the previous SQL Injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `filter` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
    *   **Details:** The PoC shows how to exploit this vulnerability via the `filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]` parameter.

**Summary**

This analysis reveals multiple critical vulnerabilities within ZoneMinder prior to version 1.32.3 including multiple SQL injection and reflected XSS vulnerabilities and a command injection vulnerability.
