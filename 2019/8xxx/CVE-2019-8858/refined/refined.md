- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in the Screen Sharing Server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A user who shares their screen may not be able to end screen sharing.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The inability to end screen sharing could allow an attacker to maintain access to the victim's screen, potentially leading to further information disclosure or unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors**: Screen sharing session.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be connected to the user's screen sharing session.
