Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** A lax path access check in the `CachingResourceDownloadRewriteRule` class. This class is responsible for handling requests for resources, and the inadequate path validation allows access to files within the `META-INF` directory in the Jira webroot.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Path Handling:** The primary weakness is the improper validation of file paths, allowing access to restricted files. This falls under the category of "Path Traversal" or "Directory Traversal" vulnerabilities.
    * **File Inclusion:** The issue allows an attacker to include and retrieve files they are not intended to have access to.
* **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially access sensitive information contained within files located in the `META-INF` directory. This might include configuration files, internal application information, or other data not meant for public exposure.
    * The content does not specify the exact contents of the META-INF folder in Jira, so the exact impact can vary.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Access:** Remote attackers can exploit this vulnerability over the network.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts malicious URLs to access files within the `META-INF` directory by manipulating the path.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Jira instance.
    *   **Basic Knowledge of URLs:** The attacker should know how to manipulate URLs to traverse to files within the webroot.

**Versions Affected:**
* Jira versions before 7.13.4
