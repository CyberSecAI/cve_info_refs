Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to the specified CVE:

**Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in `skins/classic/views/events.php` (Line 44)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `$_REQUEST['filter']` parameter, specifically its `terms` array, is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries. The `cnj` (conjunction) or `obr` parameters within the terms array are directly incorporated into the SQL query, leading to injection. In version 1.32.3 this parameter comes from `$filter['Query']['terms']`.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization and direct usage of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted `filter` parameters in HTTP requests to the `events.php` page.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server, knowledge of the vulnerable parameter names, and knowledge of SQL syntax.
* **Additional Details:** The provided PoC for version 1.32.3 is: `index.php?view=events&page=1&filter[Query][terms][0][attr]=MonitorId&filter[Query][terms][0][op]=%3D&filter[Query][terms][0][val]=1&filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]=1%2b1)and%20sleep(3)%23`

**Vulnerability 2: Reflected XSS Due to SQL Error Messages**

*   **Root Cause:** When a SQL query fails, the raw SQL error message is displayed to the user without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of output sanitization/encoding for SQL error messages.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the SQL query, which will be executed in the user's browser when the error message is displayed, potentially leading to session hijacking or other malicious actions on the user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating input parameters that are used in SQL queries to trigger an error, such as including Javascript code.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server, ability to inject SQL syntax errors in SQL queries and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Additional Details:** The provided PoC: `https://95.143.216.108/zm/index.php?view=events&page=1&filter[terms][0][attr]=MonitorId&filter[terms][0][op]=%3D&filter[terms][0][val]=1&filter[terms][0][cnj]=1432%3Cimg/src=/%20onerror=alert`1`%3E`

**Vulnerability 3: Second-Order SQL Injection in `skins/classic/views/control.php` (Line 35)**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `$groupSql` variable retrieved from the database is used in a SQL query without sanitization in `control.php`. The `$groupSql` variable is populated from the `monitors` variable in `includes/action.php`
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization when storing `monitors` into database, and direct usage of database data in SQL queries.
*   **Impact:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands by injecting malicious SQL code into the group name, potentially leading to data breaches or control over the database.
*  **Attack Vector:**  First, inject malicious SQL code into database through `index.php?action=group` and then trigger the SQL injection through `control.php`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server, knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and SQL syntax.
*  **Additional Details**: PoC:
     * Step 1: `index.php?action=group&newGroup[MonitorIds][]=1&newGroup[MonitorIds][]=2') or sleep(3)#&newGroup[Name]=132`
     * Step 2: `http://127.0.0.1/zoneminder/www/?view=control&mid=1&group={groupid}`

**Vulnerability 4: Reflected XSS in `skins/classic/views/controlcap.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** Most of the variables within the `controlcap.php` are not sanitized and directly output to the page.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of output sanitization/encoding for user-supplied input.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code via URL parameters, which will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating URL parameters like `newControl[MinTiltRange]` with malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.
*   **Additional Details:** The provided PoC is `?view=controlcap&newControl[MinTiltRange]=2333%22/%3E%3Cimg/src=/%20onerror=alert(1)%3E`

**Vulnerability 5: Command Injection in `includes/functions.php` (daemonControl)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `daemonControl` function in `includes/functions.php` executes shell commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Lack of input sanitization, leading to command injection.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Manipulating parameters used by the `daemonControl` function.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server.

**Vulnerability 6: SQL Injection in `ajax/status.php` (Line 276) - ORDER BY Clause**

*   **Root Cause:** The `sort` parameter used in the `ajax/status.php` is directly used in the `ORDER BY` clause of SQL queries without proper sanitization.
*  **Weaknesses**: Direct usage of unsanitized input within SQL queries.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can perform SQL injection.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `sort` parameter in HTTP requests.
*   **Required Capabilities:**  Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server and knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.
*  **Additional Details:** The PoC is `http://127.0.0.1/zoneminder/www/?request=status&entity=monitor&element=id&id=1&sort=123`

**Vulnerability 7: SQL Injection in `ajax/status.php` (Line 393 and 406)**

*   **Root Cause:** The `filter` parameter, specifically its nested 'terms' array used in `ajax/status.php`, is not sanitized before being used in SQL queries. The `cnj` parameter in the terms array is directly incorporated into the SQL query, leading to injection.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, and direct usage of user-supplied data in SQL queries.
*  **Impact:**  Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting malicious `filter` parameters in HTTP requests.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send crafted HTTP requests to the ZoneMinder server, knowledge of vulnerable parameter names and knowledge of SQL syntax.
*   **Additional Details:** The provided PoC is `index.php?request=status&entity=nearevents&element=id&id=13&layout=text&filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]=233)%20||1=1%23`

In summary, the provided content details multiple vulnerabilities including SQL injection, reflected XSS, second order SQL injection and command injection, all stemming from insufficient input validation and sanitization in various parts of the ZoneMinder codebase.
