Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-8632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Texture Canada Android and iOS applications were sending analytics data using HTTP instead of HTTPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Transmission:** The application transmitted analytics data, which could include potentially sensitive information such as number of app launches, device model, Android or iOS version, and screen resolution, over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** Failure to use HTTPS for transmitting analytics data exposed the data to potential interception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Interception:** An attacker positioned on a privileged network could intercept and capture the unencrypted analytics data being transmitted by the application.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The intercepted data could reveal details about the user's device and usage patterns without their knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Monitoring:** An attacker with the ability to monitor network traffic between the user's device and the server could intercept the data. This could occur on public Wi-Fi networks or other networks where the attacker has control or visibility.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Privileged Network Position:** The attacker must be in a position to monitor or intercept network traffic. This could involve:
    *   Being on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim.
    *   Compromising a network device (e.g., router)
    *   Being a network operator

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affected Texture Canada applications, but the US versions were also likely affected.
*   The vulnerability was addressed by no longer sending this analytics data (in Apple's fix)
*   Versions affected: Android version 4.21.0.1, iOS version 5.11.6 and below
*   Fixed versions: Android version 4.22.0.4, iOS version 5.11.10
