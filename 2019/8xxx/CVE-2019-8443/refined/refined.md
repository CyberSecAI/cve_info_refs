Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper access control in the `ViewUpgrades` resource. This resource is intended to be protected by "WebSudo," which requires a user to re-authenticate when accessing administrative functions. However, the vulnerability allows an attacker who already has a valid administrator session to bypass this WebSudo re-authentication requirement and access the `ViewUpgrades` resource.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Authentication:** The core issue is the lack of proper authentication enforcement for the `ViewUpgrades` resource when accessed by an administrator with a valid session.
    *   **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the intended authorization mechanism ("WebSudo") to access an administrative function.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has already gained access to an administrator's session can access the `ViewUpgrades` administrative resource without having to re-authenticate. This allows them to potentially perform actions related to upgrades that should require additional authentication.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a network request to the `ViewUpgrades` resource within the application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have obtained a valid administrator's session. This implies they have already compromised an administrator account or have gained access to an administrator's session cookies.
    *   The attacker must be able to make network requests to the affected application server.
*   **Affected Versions**: Jira versions before 7.13.4, from 8.0.0 before 8.0.4, and from 8.1.0 before 8.1.1. Specifically, version 7.13.1 is mentioned as affected.
*   **Fix Versions**: The issue is fixed in versions 7.13.4, 8.0.4 and 8.1.1.
*   **Severity:** The severity is classified as "Severity 2 - Major," and the CVSS score is considered medium.

The provided information gives more context than the description present in a typical CVE entry. It explains that the vulnerability bypasses the WebSudo authentication, which is a specific feature of Atlassian products.
