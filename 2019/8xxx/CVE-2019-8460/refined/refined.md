Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8460:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2019-8460, as it describes a TCP SACK vulnerability in OpenBSD, which is explicitly identified by that CVE ID in the Checkpoint Research article and NetApp advisory. The vulnerability is related to how OpenBSD handles TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) options.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way OpenBSD manages SACK ranges in a TCP connection's state. The received SACK ranges are kept in a sorted linked list which is vulnerable to unbounded growth leading to high CPU consumption on the receiving end. The size of the list was only limited by:
    - Size of the pool (32k entries)
    - TCP retransmit timer (up to 64 seconds)
An attacker can manipulate TCP window scaling and RTT to force a target to send a large amount of unacknowledged data, leading to an increased retransmission timeout and thus more SACK packets, which leads to the target machine CPU exhaustion

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The vulnerability arises from a lack of limitation on the number of SACK ranges stored per TCP connection, allowing an attacker to exhaust CPU resources on the server.
*   **Algorithmic Complexity:** The process of inserting new SACK ranges into a sorted list has a time complexity of O(n), and with multiple insertions, it becomes O(n^2).
*   **Lack of Per-Connection Limits:** The global limit on SACK entries (32k entries) combined with a long TCP retransmit timeout provides an opportunity for the attacker to keep the sorted list long and force a linear time complexity for insertion.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted TCP SACK packets, an attacker can cause excessive CPU usage on the target machine, leading to a denial-of-service condition. This impacts the availability of the service on that system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack is performed by sending specially crafted TCP SACK packets over a network connection.
*   **Manipulation of TCP Parameters:** The attacker manipulates TCP window scaling and round-trip time (RTT) to maximize the unacknowledged data and trigger more frequent retransmissions, resulting in a larger and more costly SACK hole list.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to establish a TCP connection to the target system.
*   **Ability to send TCP Packets:** The attacker must be able to forge TCP packets with specific SACK options to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No Prior Authentication Required:** No authentication or specific user permissions on the target system are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details (from the Check Point Research Article and NetApp Advisory):**

*   **NetApp Products Affected:** NetApp products using vulnerable OpenBSD versions, particularly Clustered Data ONTAP 9.1 and below, and Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode, are affected.  Several other NetApp products are explicitly listed as not being affected.
*   **Mitigation:** NetApp provides specific software versions that have addressed this issue. Additionally, the OpenBSD project has applied a patch limiting the SACK holes to 128 per connection.
*   **Checkpoint Firewall Protection:** Check Point firewalls have been updated to provide protection against this threat.
*   **NetApp's Fix:** NetApp limits the SACK holes list size. The NetApp advisory also notes that this vulnerability is only present in Clustered Data ONTAP 9.1 and below, and Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode.
*   **OpenBSD Fix**: The OpenBSD commit fixes the vulnerability by limiting the maximum number of SACK holes per TCP connection to 128.
