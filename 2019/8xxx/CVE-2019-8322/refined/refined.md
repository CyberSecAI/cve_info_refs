{
  "CVE-2019-8322": {
    "Description": "The gem owner command outputs the contents of the API response directly to stdout. Therefore, if the response is crafted, escape sequence injection may occur.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `gem owner` command directly outputs the API response to stdout without proper sanitization or escaping.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Escape sequence injection vulnerability.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject escape sequences into the output displayed by the gem owner command, potentially manipulating the terminal output for the user.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network. A malicious actor can manipulate the API response from the RubyGems server to include escape sequences.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or influence the content of the API response from the RubyGems server."
