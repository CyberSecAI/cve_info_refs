Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of user-supplied input in CGI scripts. Specifically, the `cmd` parameter within various CGI scripts is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting shell commands into the vulnerable `cmd` parameter.
- **Command Injection:** The application fails to sanitize or properly validate the input provided to the `cmd` parameter in the CGI scripts, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control of the vulnerable device, leading to data exfiltration, device disruption, or further network compromise.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute any command available on the target system, which can lead to severe consequences.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited through specially crafted HTTP GET requests. The attacker sends a request to vulnerable CGI scripts with the `cmd` parameter containing shell commands.
- **CGI Script Parameter Manipulation:** The attack specifically targets the `cmd` parameter within the CGI scripts, injecting commands which are then executed by the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device, typically over HTTP.
- **Basic Web Request Knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP GET requests with specific parameters.
- **Shell Command Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of shell commands to execute their desired actions on the server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided exploit code iterates through multiple vulnerable CGI scripts, increasing the likelihood of finding a vulnerable endpoint.
- The exploit code shows a method to execute arbitrary commands, such as `wget`, which can be used to download and execute further malicious payloads.
- The locked out message indicates that there are rate-limiting controls in place which may hinder attacks but do not prevent successful exploitation given correct exploitation.
