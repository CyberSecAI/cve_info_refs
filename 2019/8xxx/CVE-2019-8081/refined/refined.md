Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8081:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `urlcaller` workflow process in Adobe Experience Manager (AEM). This utility, designed for calling specified URLs, logs the provided password in debug logs.
*   **Weakness:** The core issue is the insecure logging of sensitive data (passwords) within the debug logs of the `urlcaller` workflow. This exposes the password in a potentially accessible location.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to sensitive information disclosure. Specifically, passwords used in the `urlcaller` workflow would be logged and could be accessed by those with access to the debug logs.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the logged passwords if they have access to the AEM debug logs.
*   **Required Capabilities/Position:** To exploit this, an attacker needs to have access to the AEM debug logs. This access typically requires administrative privileges or access to the server or system where the logs are stored.
*   **Additional Notes:** The provided content clarifies that the `urlcaller` process was intended for development and demos, but some organizations may have unknowingly used it in production environments, thus exposing the vulnerability. The content also mentions that an administrator would need to enable debug logging for this vulnerability to be exposed.

The blog post also provides additional information, such as:
*   The vulnerable script path: `/etc/workflow/scripts/urlcaller.ecma`
*   The arguments accepted by the script: `args := url [',' login ',' password]`
*   How the vulnerability was discovered: the author found an open querybuilder servlet to find the vulnerable script
*  Adobe's stance: Adobe considers the vulnerability to be low risk because an admin has to enable debug logging and the code is meant for demo purposes only.

This information aligns with the description provided in the Adobe Security Bulletin, which lists CVE-2019-8081 as an "Authentication Bypass" vulnerability leading to "Sensitive Information disclosure".
