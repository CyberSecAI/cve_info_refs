Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-8451

**Root Cause:** A logic flaw in the `JiraWhitelist` class within the `/plugins/servlet/gadgets/makeRequest` resource allows for Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This flaw permits remote attackers to access content from internal network resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to make requests to arbitrary URLs from the server.
*   **Insufficient Whitelisting:**  The `JiraWhitelist` class, intended to prevent SSRF by limiting allowed URLs, has a flaw that can be bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Access to Internal Resources:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to probe and potentially retrieve data from internal services and resources not directly accessible from the outside network.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by remote attackers over the network.
*   **Gadgets Resource:** The specific attack vector is through the `/plugins/servlet/gadgets/makeRequest` resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Jira server.
*   **Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, manipulating the URL parameter.

**Additional Information:**
*   **Versions Affected:** Jira versions 7.6.9, 8.1.0, and 8.0.2 are specifically noted as vulnerable. The vulnerability was introduced in version 7.06.
*   **Fix Versions:** The vulnerability is fixed in Jira versions 8.4.0, 7.6.17, and 7.13.9
*   **Patching:** The fix is deployed by configuring the Jira URL allow list. The allowlist is enabled by default, but the fixed versions are vulnerable if the allowlist is disabled.
*   **Severity:** The severity of the vulnerability is marked as "Severity 2 - Major".
*   **CVSS:** The vulnerability is labeled with `cvss-high`.
