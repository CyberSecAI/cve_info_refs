Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2019-8368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the presence of reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the OpenEMR application. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Server Compromise:** By enticing an administrative user to interact with a malicious link, an attacker can gain the ability to upload and execute a PHP reverse shell on the server, leading to complete server compromise.
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Although not explicitly detailed, the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server can lead to the exposure of sensitive patient data.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could potentially take over the account of an administrative user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack is launched remotely over the network.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack relies on a user clicking a specially crafted link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that contains the XSS payload.
*   The attacker needs to entice a victim, typically an administrator of the OpenEMR application, to click on the malicious link.
*   No authentication is needed to exploit the XSS, although to achieve RCE, the victim needs to be an administrator.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory from Bishop Fox provides detailed steps on how to exploit the vulnerability, including a proof-of-concept JavaScript payload that uploads and executes a reverse shell.
*   Multiple locations within the application were vulnerable to XSS including:
    *   `facility_admin.php`
    *  `RulesPlanMappingEventHandlers_ajax.php`
    *  `office_comments_full.php`
    *  `dicom_frame.php`

**CVSS Score:**
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 score of 6.1 (Medium) with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
