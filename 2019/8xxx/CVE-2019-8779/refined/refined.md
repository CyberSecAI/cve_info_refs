- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue caused incorrect sandbox restrictions to be applied to third-party app extensions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect application of sandbox restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Third-party app extensions might not receive the proper sandbox restrictions, potentially allowing them to access resources or perform actions they should not have access to.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via a third-party app extension.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have a malicious third-party app extension installed on a vulnerable device.
