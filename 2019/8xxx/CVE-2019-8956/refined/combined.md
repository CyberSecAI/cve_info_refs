perf/x86/intel: Delay memory deallocation until x86\_pmu\_dead\_cpu()
commit 602cae04c4864bb3487dfe4c2126c8d9e7e1614a upstream.
intel\_pmu\_cpu\_prepare() allocated memory for ->shared\_regs among other
members of struct cpu\_hw\_events. This memory is released in
intel\_pmu\_cpu\_dying() which is wrong. The counterpart of the
intel\_pmu\_cpu\_prepare() callback is x86\_pmu\_dead\_cpu().
Otherwise if the CPU fails on the UP path between CPUHP\_PERF\_X86\_PREPARE
and CPUHP\_AP\_PERF\_X86\_STARTING then it won't release the memory but
allocate new memory on the next attempt to online the CPU (leaking the
old memory).
Also, if the CPU down path fails between CPUHP\_AP\_PERF\_X86\_STARTING and
CPUHP\_PERF\_X86\_PREPARE then the CPU will go back online but never
allocate the memory that was released in x86\_pmu\_dying\_cpu().
Make the memory allocation/free symmetrical in regard to the CPU hotplug
notifier by moving the deallocation to intel\_pmu\_cpu\_dead().
This started in commit:
a7e3ed1e47011 ("perf: Add support for supplementary event registers").
In principle the bug was introduced in v2.6.39 (!), but it will almost
certainly not backport cleanly across the big CPU hotplug rewrite between v4.7-v4.15...

Fix potential memory corruption and panic in loopback for IB\_WR\_SEND

The code blindly assumes the posted length will fit in the fetched rwqe,
which is not a valid assumption.
Fix by adding a limit test, and triggering the appropriate send completion
and putting the QP in an error state. This mimics the handling for

serial: fix race between flush\_to\_ldisc and tty\_open
commit fedb5760648a291e949f2380d383b5b2d2749b5e upstream.
There still is a race window after the commit b027e2298bd588
("tty: fix data race between tty\_init\_dev and flush of buf"),
and we encountered this crash issue if receive\_buf call comes
before tty initialization completes in tty\_open and
tty->driver\_data may be NULL.

/\*tty->driver\_data is NULL\*/
tty->ops->open
/\*init tty->driver\_data\*/
it can be fixed by extending ldisc semaphore lock in tty\_init\_dev
to driver\_data initialized completely after tty->ops->open(), but
this will lead to get lock on one function and unlock in some other
function, and hard to maintain, so fix this race only by checking
tty->driver\_data when receiving, and return if tty->driver\_data
is NULL, and n\_tty\_receive\_buf\_common maybe calls uart\_unthrottle,
so add the same check.
Because the tty layer knows nothing about the driver associated with the
device, the tty layer can not do anything here, it is up to the tty
driver itself to check for this type of race. Fix up the serial driver
to correctly check to see if it is finished binding with the device when
being called, and if not, abort the tty calls.

perf/core: Don't WARN() for impossible ring-buffer sizes
commit 9dff0aa95a324e262ffb03f425d00e4751f3294e upstream.
The perf tool uses /proc/sys/kernel/perf\_event\_mlock\_kb to determine how
large its ringbuffer mmap should be. This can be configured to arbitrary
values, which can be larger than the maximum possible allocation from
kmalloc.
When this is configured to a suitably large value (e.g. thanks to the
perf fuzzer), attempting to use perf record triggers a WARN\_ON\_ONCE() in
\_\_alloc\_pages\_nodemask():
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 5666 at mm/page\_alloc.c:4511 \_\_alloc\_pages\_nodemask+0x3f8/0xbc8
Let's avoid this by checking that the requested allocation is possible
before calling kzalloc.

x86/MCE: Initialize mce.bank in the case of a fatal error in mce\_no\_way\_out()
commit d28af26faa0b1daf3c692603d46bc4687c16f19e upstream.
Internal injection testing crashed with a console log that said:
mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 7: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 0: bd80000000100134
This caused a lot of head scratching because the MCACOD (bits 15:0) of
that status is a signature from an L1 data cache error. But Linux says
that it found it in "Bank 0", which on this model CPU only reports L1
instruction cache errors.
The answer was that Linux doesn't initialize "m->bank" in the case that
it finds a fatal error in the mce\_no\_way\_out() pre-scan of banks. If
this was a local machine check, then this partially initialized struct
mce is being passed to mce\_panic().
Fix is simple: just initialize m->bank in the case of a fatal error.

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Node ID mask
commit 9e63a7894fd302082cf3627fe90844421a6cbe7f upstream.
Some PCI uncore PMUs cannot be registered on an 8-socket system (HPE
Superdome Flex).
To understand which Socket the PCI uncore PMUs belongs to, perf retrieves
the local Node ID of the uncore device from CPUNODEID(0xC0) of the PCI
configuration space, and the mapping between Socket ID and Node ID from
GIDNIDMAP(0xD4). The Socket ID can be calculated accordingly.
The local Node ID is only available at bit 2:0, but current code doesn't
mask it. If a BIOS doesn't clear the rest of the bits, an incorrect Node ID
will be fetched.
Filter the Node ID by adding a mask.

cpu/hotplug: Fix "SMT disabled by BIOS" detection for KVM
commit b284909abad48b07d3071a9fc9b5692b3e64914b upstream.
With the following commit:
73d5e2b47264 ("cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS")
... the hotplug code attempted to detect when SMT was disabled by BIOS,
in which case it reported SMT as permanently disabled. However, that
code broke a virt hotplug scenario, where the guest is booted with only
primary CPU threads, and a sibling is brought online later.
The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a way to reliably
distinguish between the HW "SMT disabled by BIOS" case and the virt
"sibling not yet brought online" case. So the above-mentioned commit
was a bit misguided, as it permanently disabled SMT for both cases,
preventing future virt sibling hotplugs.
Going back and reviewing the original problems which were attempted to
be solved by that commit, when SMT was disabled in BIOS:
1) /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control showed "on" instead of
"notsupported"; and
2) vmx\_vm\_init() was incorrectly showing the L1TF\_MSG\_SMT warning.
I'd propose that we instead consider #1 above to not actually be a
problem. Because, at least in the virt case, it's possible that SMT
wasn't disabled by BIOS and a sibling thread could be brought online
later. So it makes sense to just always default the smt control to "on"
to allow for that possibility (assuming cpuid indicates that the CPU
supports SMT).
The real problem is #2, which has a simple fix: change vmx\_vm\_init() to
query the actual current SMT state -- i.e., whether any siblings are
currently online -- instead of looking at the SMT "control" sysfs value.
So fix it by:
a) reverting the original "fix" and its followup fix:
73d5e2b47264 ("cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS")
bc2d8d262cba ("cpu/hotplug: Fix SMT supported evaluation")
and
b) changing vmx\_vm\_init() to query the actual current SMT state --
instead of the sysfs control value -- to determine whether the L1TF
warning is needed. This also requires the 'sched\_smt\_present'
variable to exported, instead of 'cpu\_smt\_control'.

kvm: fix kvm\_ioctl\_create\_device() reference counting (CVE-2019-6974)
commit cfa39381173d5f969daf43582c95ad679189cbc9 upstream.
kvm\_ioctl\_create\_device() does the following:
1. creates a device that holds a reference to the VM object (with a borrowed
reference, the VM's refcount has not been bumped yet)
2. initializes the device
3. transfers the reference to the device to the caller's file descriptor table
4. calls kvm\_get\_kvm() to turn the borrowed reference to the VM into a real
reference
The ownership transfer in step 3 must not happen before the reference to the VM
becomes a proper, non-borrowed reference, which only happens in step 4.
After step 3, an attacker can close the file descriptor and drop the borrowed
reference, which can cause the refcount of the kvm object to drop to zero.
This means that we need to grab a reference for the device before
anon\_inode\_getfd(), otherwise the VM can disappear from under us.

Emulation of certain instructions (VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, VMWRITE with

when passed an operand that points to an MMIO address. The page fault
will use uninitialized kernel stack memory as the CR2 and error code.
The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM\_EXIT\_INTERNAL\_ERROR
exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just
ensure that the error code and CR2 are zero.

Because the PCI code had recently added a file named 'revision' to every
PCI device. Fix this by renaming the aic94xx revision file to
aic\_revision. This is safe to do for us because as far as I can tell,
there's nothing in userspace relying on the current aic94xx revision file

successfully probed the 'cxlflash\_cfg->state' never changes from
STATE\_PROBING hence the deadlock occurs.
We fix this deadlock by setting the variable 'cxlflash\_cfg->state' to
STATE\_PROBED in case an error occurs during cxlflash\_probe() and just
before calling cxlflash\_remove().

usb: gadget: musb: fix short isoc packets with inventra dma
commit c418fd6c01fbc5516a2cd1eaf1df1ec86869028a upstream.
Handling short packets (length < max packet size) in the Inventra DMA
engine in the MUSB driver causes the MUSB DMA controller to hang. An
example of a problem that is caused by this problem is when streaming
video out of a UVC gadget, only the first video frame is transferred.
For short packets (mode-0 or mode-1 DMA), MUSB\_TXCSR\_TXPKTRDY must be
set manually by the driver. This was previously done in musb\_g\_tx
(musb\_gadget.c), but incorrectly (all csr flags were cleared, and only
MUSB\_TXCSR\_MODE and MUSB\_TXCSR\_TXPKTRDY were set). Fixing that problem
allows some requests to be transferred correctly, but multiple requests
were often put together in one USB packet, and caused problems if the
packet size was not a multiple of 4. Instead, set MUSB\_TXCSR\_TXPKTRDY
in dma\_controller\_irq (musbhsdma.c), just like host mode transfers.
This topic was originally tackled by Nicolas Boichat [0] [1] and is

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Plug allocation race for devices sharing a DevID
commit 9791ec7df0e7b4d80706ccea8f24b6542f6059e9 upstream.
On systems or VMs where multiple devices share a single DevID
(because they sit behind a PCI bridge, or because the HW is
broken in funky ways), we reuse the save its\_device structure
in order to reflect this.
It turns out that there is a distinct lack of locking when looking
up the its\_device, and two device being probed concurrently can result
in double allocations. That's obviously not nice.
A solution for this is to have a per-ITS mutex that serializes device
allocation.
A similar issue exists on the freeing side, which can run concurrently
with the allocation. On top of now taking the appropriate lock, we
also make sure that a shared device is never freed, as we have no way
to currently track the life cycle of such object.

futex: Handle early deadlock return correctly
commit 1a1fb985f2e2b85ec0d3dc2e519ee48389ec2434 upstream.
commit 56222b212e8e ("futex: Drop hb->lock before enqueueing on the
rtmutex") changed the locking rules in the futex code so that the hash
bucket lock is not longer held while the waiter is enqueued into the
rtmutex wait list. This made the lock and the unlock path symmetric, but
unfortunately the possible early exit from \_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() due to
a detected deadlock was not updated accordingly. That allows a concurrent
unlocker to observe inconsitent state which triggers the warning in the
unlock path.
futex\_lock\_pi() futex\_unlock\_pi()
lock(hb->lock)
queue(hb\_waiter) lock(hb->lock)
lock(rtmutex->wait\_lock)
unlock(hb->lock)
// acquired hb->lock
hb\_waiter = futex\_top\_waiter()
lock(rtmutex->wait\_lock)
\_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start()
---> fail
remove(rtmutex\_waiter);
---> returns -EDEADLOCK
unlock(rtmutex->wait\_lock)
// acquired wait\_lock
wake\_futex\_pi()
rt\_mutex\_next\_owner()
--> returns NULL
--> WARN
lock(hb->lock)
unqueue(hb\_waiter)
The problem is caused by the remove(rtmutex\_waiter) in the failure case of
\_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() as this lets the unlocker observe a waiter in the
hash bucket but no waiter on the rtmutex, i.e. inconsistent state.
The original commit handles this correctly for the other early return cases
(timeout, signal) by delaying the removal of the rtmutex waiter until the
returning task reacquired the hash bucket lock.
Treat the failure case of \_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() in the same way and let
the existing cleanup code handle the eventual handover of the rtmutex
gracefully. The regular rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() gains the rtmutex waiter
removal for the failure case, so that the other callsites are still
operating correctly.
Add proper comments to the code so all these details are fully documented.
Thanks to Peter for helping with the analysis and writing the really
valuable code comments.

dmaengine: imx-dma: fix wrong callback invoke
commit 341198eda723c8c1cddbb006a89ad9e362502ea2 upstream.
Once the "ld\_queue" list is not empty, next descriptor will migrate
into "ld\_active" list. The "desc" variable will be overwritten
during that transition. And later the dmaengine\_desc\_get\_callback\_invoke()
will use it as an argument. As result we invoke wrong callback.
That behaviour was in place since:
commit fcaaba6c7136 ("dmaengine: imx-dma: fix callback path in tasklet").
But after commit 4cd13c21b207 ("softirq: Let ksoftirqd do its job")
things got worse, since possible delay between tasklet\_schedule()
from DMA irq handler and actual tasklet function execution got bigger.
And that gave more time for new DMA request to be submitted and
to be put into "ld\_queue" list.
It has been noticed that DMA issue is causing problems for "mxc-mmc"
driver. While stressing the system with heavy network traffic and
writing/reading to/from sd card simultaneously the timeout may happen:
10013000.sdhci: mxcmci\_watchdog: read time out (status = 0x30004900)
That often lead to file system corruption.

dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix abort of transactions
commit 9e528c799d17a4ac37d788c81440b50377dd592d upstream.
There are multiple issues with bcm2835\_dma\_abort() (which is called on
termination of a transaction):
\* The algorithm to abort the transaction first pauses the channel by
clearing the ACTIVE flag in the CS register, then waits for the PAUSED
flag to clear. Page 49 of the spec documents the latter as follows:
"Indicates if the DMA is currently paused and not transferring data.
This will occur if the active bit has been cleared [...]"
https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf
So the function is entering an infinite loop because it is waiting for
PAUSED to clear which is always set due to the function having cleared
the ACTIVE flag. The only thing that's saving it from itself is the
upper bound of 10000 loop iterations.
The code comment says that the intention is to "wait for any current
AXI transfer to complete", so the author probably wanted to check the
WAITING\_FOR\_OUTSTANDING\_WRITES flag instead. Amend the function
accordingly.
\* The CS register is only read at the beginning of the function. It
needs to be read again after pausing the channel and before checking
for outstanding writes, otherwise writes which were issued between
the register read at the beginning of the function and pausing the
channel may not be waited for.
\* The function seeks to abort the transfer by writing 0 to the NEXTCONBK
register and setting the ABORT and ACTIVE flags. Thereby, the 0 in
NEXTCONBK is sought to be loaded into the CONBLK\_AD register. However
experimentation has shown this approach to not work: The CONBLK\_AD
register remains the same as before and the CS register contains
0x00000030 (PAUSED | DREQ\_STOPS\_DMA). In other words, the control
block is not aborted but merely paused and it will be resumed once the
next DMA transaction is started. That is absolutely not the desired
behavior.
A simpler approach is to set the channel's RESET flag instead. This
reliably zeroes the NEXTCONBK as well as the CS register. It requires
less code and only a single MMIO write. This is also what popular
user space DMA drivers do, e.g.:
https://github.com/metachris/RPIO/blob/master/source/c\_pwm/pwm.c
Note that the spec is contradictory whether the NEXTCONBK register
is writeable at all. On the one hand, page 41 claims:
"The value loaded into the NEXTCONBK register can be overwritten so
that the linked list of Control Block data structures can be
dynamically altered. However it is only safe to do this when the DMA
is paused."
On the other hand, page 40 specifies:
"Only three registers in each channel's register set are directly
writeable (CS, CONBLK\_AD and DEBUG). The other registers (TI,
SOURCE\_AD, DEST\_AD, TXFR\_LEN, STRIDE & NEXTCONBK), are automatically
loaded from a Control Block data structure held in external memory."

dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix interrupt race on RT
commit f7da7782aba92593f7b82f03d2409a1c5f4db91b upstream.
If IRQ handlers are threaded (either because CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_RT\_BASE is
enabled or "threadirqs" was passed on the command line) and if system
load is sufficiently high that wakeup latency of IRQ threads degrades,
SPI DMA transactions on the BCM2835 occasionally break like this:
ks8851 spi0.0: SPI transfer timed out
bcm2835-dma 3f007000.dma: DMA transfer could not be terminated
ks8851 spi0.0 eth2: ks8851\_rdfifo: spi\_sync() failed
The root cause is an assumption made by the DMA driver which is
documented in a code comment in bcm2835\_dma\_terminate\_all():
/\*
\* Stop DMA activity: we assume the callback will not be called
\* after bcm\_dma\_abort() returns (even if it does, it will see
\* c->desc is NULL and exit.)
\*/
That assumption falls apart if the IRQ handler bcm2835\_dma\_callback() is
threaded: A client may terminate a descriptor and issue a new one
before the IRQ handler had a chance to run. In fact the IRQ handler may
miss an \*arbitrary\* number of descriptors. The result is the following
race condition:
1. A descriptor finishes, its interrupt is deferred to the IRQ thread.
2. A client calls dma\_terminate\_async() which sets channel->desc = NULL.
3. The client issues a new descriptor. Because channel->desc is NULL,
bcm2835\_dma\_issue\_pending() immediately starts the descriptor.
4. Finally the IRQ thread runs and writes BCM2835\_DMA\_INT to the CS
register to acknowledge the interrupt. This clears the ACTIVE flag,
so the newly issued descriptor is paused in the middle of the
transaction. Because channel->desc is not NULL, the IRQ thread
finalizes the descriptor and tries to start the next one.
I see two possible solutions: The first is to call synchronize\_irq()
in bcm2835\_dma\_issue\_pending() to wait until the IRQ thread has
finished before issuing a new descriptor. The downside of this approach
is unnecessary latency if clients desire rapidly terminating and
re-issuing descriptors and don't have any use for an IRQ callback.
(The SPI TX DMA channel is a case in point.)
A better alternative is to make the IRQ thread recognize that it has
missed descriptors and avoid finalizing the newly issued descriptor.
So first of all, set the ACTIVE flag when acknowledging the interrupt.
This keeps a newly issued descriptor running.
If the descriptor was finished, the channel remains idle despite the
ACTIVE flag being set. However the ACTIVE flag can then no longer be
used to check whether the channel is idle, so instead check whether
the register containing the current control block address is zero
and finalize the current descriptor only if so.
That way, there is no impact on latency and throughput if the client
doesn't care for the interrupt: Only minimal additional overhead is
introduced for non-cyclic descriptors as one further MMIO read is
necessary per interrupt to check for idleness of the channel. Cyclic
descriptors are sped up slightly by removing one MMIO write per
interrupt.

The controller probe invokes snd\_card\_register() that does the whole

ALSA: usb-audio: Add support for new T+A USB DAC
commit 3bff2407fbd28fd55ad5b5cccd98fc0c9598f23b upstream.
This patch adds the T+A VID to the generic check in order to enable
native DSD support for T+A devices. This works with the new T+A USB
DAC model SD3100HV and will also work with future devices which
support the XMOS/Thesycon style DSD format.

ALSA: compress: Fix stop handling on compressed capture streams
commit 4f2ab5e1d13d6aa77c55f4914659784efd776eb4 upstream.
It is normal user behaviour to start, stop, then start a stream
again without closing it. Currently this works for compressed
playback streams but not capture ones.
The states on a compressed capture stream go directly from OPEN to
PREPARED, unlike a playback stream which moves to SETUP and waits
for a write of data before moving to PREPARED. Currently however,
when a stop is sent the state is set to SETUP for both types of
streams. This leaves a capture stream in the situation where a new
start can't be sent as that requires the state to be PREPARED and
a new set\_params can't be sent as that requires the state to be
OPEN. The only option being to close the stream, and then reopen.
Correct this issues by allowing snd\_compr\_drain\_notify to set the
state depending on the stream direction, as we already do in
set\_params.

xfs: eof trim writeback mapping as soon as it is cached
commit aa6ee4ab69293969867ab09b57546d226ace3d7a upstream.
The cached writeback mapping is EOF trimmed to try and avoid races
between post-eof block management and writeback that result in
sending cached data to a stale location. The cached mapping is
currently trimmed on the validation check, which leaves a race
window between the time the mapping is cached and when it is trimmed
against the current inode size.
For example, if a new mapping is cached by delalloc conversion on a
blocksize == page size fs, we could cycle various locks, perform
memory allocations, etc. in the writeback codepath before the
associated mapping is eventually trimmed to i\_size. This leaves
enough time for a post-eof truncate and file append before the
cached mapping is trimmed. The former event essentially invalidates
a range of the cached mapping and the latter bumps the inode size
such the trim on the next writepage event won't trim all of the
invalid blocks. fstest generic/464 reproduces this scenario
occasionally and causes a lost writeback and stale delalloc blocks
warning on inode inactivation.
To work around this problem, trim the cached writeback mapping as
soon as it is cached in addition to on subsequent validation checks.
This is a minor tweak to tighten the race window as much as possible
until a proper invalidation mechanism is available.

net/mlx5e: FPGA, fix Innova IPsec TX offload data path performance
[ Upstream commit 82eaa1fa0448da1852d7b80832e67e80a08dcc27 ]
At Innova IPsec TX offload data path a special software parser metadata
is used to pass some packet attributes to the hardware, this metadata
is passed using the Ethernet control segment of a WQE (a HW descriptor)
header.
The cited commit might nullify this header, hence the metadata is lost,
this caused a significant performance drop during hw offloading
operation.
Fix by restoring the metadata at the Ethernet control segment in case
it was nullified.

be copied to the new ones and the old ones will be freed.

Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it

net/mlx5e: Force CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY for short ethernet frames
[ Upstream commit e8c8b53ccaff568fef4c13a6ccaf08bf241aa01a ]
When an ethernet frame is padded to meet the minimum ethernet frame
size, the padding octets are not covered by the hardware checksum.
Fortunately the padding octets are usually zero's, which don't affect
checksum. However, we have a switch which pads non-zero octets, this
causes kernel hardware checksum fault repeatedly.
Prior to:
commit '88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb\_trim\_rcsum() and CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE ...")'
skb checksum was forced to be CHECKSUM\_NONE when padding is detected.
After it, we need to keep skb->csum updated, like what we do for RXFCS.
However, fixing up CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE requires to verify and parse IP
headers, it is not worthy the effort as the packets are so small that
CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE can't save anything.

net: dsa: slave: Don't propagate flag changes on down slave interfaces
[ Upstream commit 17ab4f61b8cd6f9c38e9d0b935d86d73b5d0d2b5 ]
The unbalance of master's promiscuity or allmulti will happen after ifdown
and ifup a slave interface which is in a bridge.
When we ifdown a slave interface , both the 'dsa\_slave\_close' and
'dsa\_slave\_change\_rx\_flags' will clear the master's flags. The flags
of master will be decrease twice.
In the other hand, if we ifup the slave interface again, since the
slave's flags were cleared the 'dsa\_slave\_open' won't set the master's
flag, only 'dsa\_slave\_change\_rx\_flags' that triggered by 'br\_add\_if'
will set the master's flags. The flags of master is increase once.
Only propagating flag changes when a slave interface is up makes
sure this does not happen. The 'vlan\_dev\_change\_rx\_flags' had the
same problem and was fixed, and changes here follows that fix.

resulted in the wrong interfaces counter being incremented, and
potentially going off the end of the array of ports.
Fix this by using the source port ID for the violation, which really
is a port number.

net: dp83640: expire old TX-skb
[ Upstream commit 53bc8d2af08654659abfadfd3e98eb9922ff787c ]
During sendmsg() a cloned skb is saved via dp83640\_txtstamp() in
->tx\_queue. After the NIC sends this packet, the PHY will reply with a
timestamp for that TX packet. If the cable is pulled at the right time I
don't see that packet. It might gets flushed as part of queue shutdown
on NIC's side.
Once the link is up again then after the next sendmsg() we enqueue
another skb in dp83640\_txtstamp() and have two on the list. Then the PHY
will send a reply and decode\_txts() attaches it to the first skb on the
list.
No crash occurs since refcounting works but we are one packet behind.
linuxptp/ptp4l usually closes the socket and opens a new one (in such a
timeout case) so those "stale" replies never get there. However it does
not resume normal operation anymore.
Purge old skbs in decode\_txts().

xfs\_btree\_sblock\_verify\_crc is a bool so should not be returning

\_\_this\_address which looks like a boolean true (i.e. success)

xfs: fix PAGE\_MASK usage in xfs\_free\_file\_space
commit a579121f94aba4e8bad1a121a0fad050d6925296 upstream.
In commit e53c4b598, I \*tried\* to teach xfs to force writeback when we
fzero/fpunch right up to EOF so that if EOF is in the middle of a page,
the post-EOF part of the page gets zeroed before we return to userspace.
Unfortunately, I missed the part where PAGE\_MASK is ~(PAGE\_SIZE - 1),
which means that we totally fail to zero if we're fpunching and EOF is
within the first page. Worse yet, the same PAGE\_MASK thinko plagues the
filemap\_write\_and\_wait\_range call, so we'd initiate writeback of the
entire file, which (mostly) masked the thinko.
Drop the tricky PAGE\_MASK and replace it with correct usage of PAGE\_SIZE
and the proper rounding macros.

xfs: delalloc -> unwritten COW fork allocation can go wrong
commit 9230a0b65b47fe6856c4468ec0175c4987e5bede upstream.
Long saga. There have been days spent following this through dead end
after dead end in multi-GB event traces. This morning, after writing
a trace-cmd wrapper that enabled me to be more selective about XFS
trace points, I discovered that I could get just enough essential
tracepoints enabled that there was a 50:50 chance the fsx config
would fail at ~115k ops. If it didn't fail at op 115547, I stopped
fsx at op 115548 anyway.
That gave me two traces - one where the problem manifested, and one
where it didn't. After refining the traces to have the necessary
information, I found that in the failing case there was a real
extent in the COW fork compared to an unwritten extent in the
working case.
Walking back through the two traces to the point where the CWO fork
extents actually diverged, I found that the bad case had an extra
unwritten extent in it. This is likely because the bug it led me to
had triggered multiple times in those 115k ops, leaving stray
COW extents around. What I saw was a COW delalloc conversion to an
unwritten extent (as they should always be through
xfs\_iomap\_write\_allocate()) resulted in a /written extent/:
xfs\_writepage: dev 259:0 ino 0x83 pgoff 0x17000 size 0x79a00 offset 0 length 0
xfs\_iext\_remove: dev 259:0 ino 0x83 state RC|LF|RF|COW cur 0xffff888247b899c0/2 offset 32 block 152 count 20 flag 1 caller xfs\_bmap\_add\_extent\_delay\_real
xfs\_bmap\_pre\_update: dev 259:0 ino 0x83 state RC|LF|RF|COW cur 0xffff888247b899c0/1 offset 1 block 4503599627239429 count 31 flag 0 caller xfs\_bmap\_add\_extent\_delay\_real
xfs\_bmap\_post\_update: dev 259:0 ino 0x83 state RC|LF|RF|COW cur 0xffff888247b899c0/1 offset 1 block 121 count 51 flag 0 caller xfs\_bmap\_add\_ex
Basically, Cow fork before:
0 1 32 52
+H+DDDDDDDDDDDD+UUUUUUUUUUU+
PREV RIGHT
COW delalloc conversion allocates:
1 32
+uuuuuuuuuuuu+
NEW
And the result according to the xfs\_bmap\_post\_update trace was:
0 1 32 52
+H+wwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww+
PREV
Which is clearly wrong - it should be a merged unwritten extent,
not an unwritten extent.
That lead me to look at the LEFT\_FILLING|RIGHT\_FILLING|RIGHT\_CONTIG
case in xfs\_bmap\_add\_extent\_delay\_real(), and sure enough, there's
the bug.
It takes the old delalloc extent (PREV) and adds the length of the
RIGHT extent to it, takes the start block from NEW, removes the
RIGHT extent and then updates PREV with the new extent.
What it fails to do is update PREV.br\_state. For delalloc, this is
always XFS\_EXT\_NORM, while in this case we are converting the
delayed allocation to unwritten, so it needs to be updated to
XFS\_EXT\_UNWRITTEN. This LF|RF|RC case does not do this, and so
the resultant extent is always written.
And that's the bug I've been chasing for a week - a bmap btree bug,
not a reflink/dedupe/copy\_file\_range bug, but a BMBT bug introduced
with the recent in core extent tree scalability enhancements.

xfs: fix transient reference count error in xfs\_buf\_resubmit\_failed\_buffers
commit d43aaf1685aa471f0593685c9f54d53e3af3cf3f upstream.
When retrying a failed inode or dquot buffer,
xfs\_buf\_resubmit\_failed\_buffers() clears all the failed flags from
the inde/dquot log items. In doing so, it also drops all the
reference counts on the buffer that the failed log items hold. This
means it can drop all the active references on the buffer and hence
free the buffer before it queues it for write again.
Putting the buffer on the delwri queue takes a reference to the
buffer (so that it hangs around until it has been written and
completed), but this goes bang if the buffer has already been freed.
Hence we need to add the buffer to the delwri queue before we remove
the failed flags from the log items attached to the buffer to ensure
it always remains referenced during the resubmit process.

xfs: fix shared extent data corruption due to missing cow reservation
commit 59e4293149106fb92530f8e56fa3992d8548c5e6 upstream.
Page writeback indirectly handles shared extents via the existence
of overlapping COW fork blocks. If COW fork blocks exist, writeback
always performs the associated copy-on-write regardless if the
underlying blocks are actually shared. If the blocks are shared,
then overlapping COW fork blocks must always exist.
fstests shared/010 reproduces a case where a buffered write occurs
over a shared block without performing the requisite COW fork
reservation. This ultimately causes writeback to the shared extent
and data corruption that is detected across md5 checks of the
filesystem across a mount cycle.
The problem occurs when a buffered write lands over a shared extent
that crosses an extent size hint boundary and that also happens to
have a partial COW reservation that doesn't cover the start and end
blocks of the data fork extent.
For example, a buffered write occurs across the file offset (in FSB
units) range of [29, 57]. A shared extent exists at blocks [29, 35]
and COW reservation already exists at blocks [32, 34]. After
accommodating a COW extent size hint of 32 blocks and the existing
reservation at offset 32, xfs\_reflink\_reserve\_cow() allocates 32
blocks of reservation at offset 0 and returns with COW reservation
across the range of [0, 34]. The associated data fork extent is
still [29, 35], however, which isn't fully covered by the COW
reservation.
This leads to a buffered write at file offset 35 over a shared
extent without associated COW reservation. Writeback eventually
kicks in, performs an overwrite of the underlying shared block and
causes the associated data corruption.
Update xfs\_reflink\_reserve\_cow() to accommodate the fact that a
delalloc allocation request may not fully cover the extent in the
data fork. Trim the data fork extent appropriately, just as is done
for shared extent boundaries and/or existing COW reservations that
happen to overlap the start of the data fork extent. This prevents
shared/010 failures due to data corruption on reflink enabled
filesystems.

freemap[1].base = 0xfe98
freemap[1].size = 0x0168 end = 0x10000
freemap[2].base = 0xf0d8
freemap[2].size = 0x07e0 end = 0xf8b8
These all look valid - the block size is 0x10000 and so from the
last check in the above verifier fragment we know that the end
of freemap[1] is valid. The problem is that end is declared as:
uint16\_t end;
And (uint16\_t)0x10000 = 0. So we have a verifier bug here, not a
corruption. Fix the verifier to use uint32\_t types for the check and
hence avoid the overflow.

Before commit 232b51948b99 ("xfs: simplify the xfs\_getbmap interface")
this was not an issue because all error paths were returning directly,
but now that some cleanup at the end may be needed, we must propagate the
error code.

xfs: cancel COW blocks before swapext
commit 96987eea537d6ccd98704a71958f9ba02da80843 upstream.
We need to make sure we have no outstanding COW blocks before we swap
extents, as there is nothing preventing us from having preallocated COW
delalloc on either inode that swapext is called on. That case can
easily be reproduced by running generic/324 in always\_cow mode:

Commit 903e8ff86753 ("kernel/kcov.c: mark funcs in \_\_sanitizer\_cov\_trace\_pc() as notrace")

created gcc-7 was used. In lib/Kconfig.debug
config KCOV\_ENABLE\_COMPARISONS

That code path isn't hit with gcc-7. However, it were that with gcc-8.

exec: load\_script: don't blindly truncate shebang string
[ Upstream commit 8099b047ecc431518b9bb6bdbba3549bbecdc343 ]
load\_script() simply truncates bprm->buf and this is very wrong if the
length of shebang string exceeds BINPRM\_BUF\_SIZE-2. This can silently
truncate i\_arg or (worse) we can execute the wrong binary if buf[2:126]
happens to be the valid executable path.
Change load\_script() to return ENOEXEC if it can't find '\n' or zero in
bprm->buf. Note that '\0' can come from either
prepare\_binprm()->memset() or from kernel\_read(), we do not care.

fs/epoll: drop ovflist branch prediction
[ Upstream commit 76699a67f3041ff4c7af6d6ee9be2bfbf1ffb671 ]
The ep->ovflist is a secondary ready-list to temporarily store events
that might occur when doing sproc without holding the ep->wq.lock. This
accounts for every time we check for ready events and also send events
back to userspace; both callbacks, particularly the latter because of
copy\_to\_user, can account for a non-trivial time.
As such, the unlikely() check to see if the pointer is being used, seems
both misleading and sub-optimal. In fact, we go to an awful lot of
trouble to sync both lists, and populating the ovflist is far from an
uncommon scenario.
For example, profiling a concurrent epoll\_wait(2) benchmark, with
CONFIG\_PROFILE\_ANNOTATED\_BRANCHES shows that for a two threads a 33%
incorrect rate was seen; and when incrementally increasing the number of
epoll instances (which is used, for example for multiple queuing load
balancing models), up to a 90% incorrect rate was seen.
Similarly, by deleting the prediction, 3% throughput boost was seen
across incremental threads.

kernel/hung\_task.c: force console verbose before panic
[ Upstream commit 168e06f7937d96c7222037d8a05565e8a6eb00fe ]
Based on commit 401c636a0eeb ("kernel/hung\_task.c: show all hung tasks
before panic"), we could get the call stack of hung task.
However, if the console loglevel is not high, we still can not see the
useful panic information in practice, and in most cases users don't set
console loglevel to high level.
This patch is to force console verbose before system panic, so that the
real useful information can be seen in the console, instead of being
like the following, which doesn't have hung task information.

proc/sysctl: fix return error for proc\_doulongvec\_minmax()
[ Upstream commit 09be178400829dddc1189b50a7888495dd26aa84 ]
If the number of input parameters is less than the total parameters, an
EINVAL error will be returned.
For example, we use proc\_doulongvec\_minmax to pass up to two parameters
with kern\_table:
{
.procname = "monitor\_signals",
.data = &monitor\_sigs,
.maxlen = 2\*sizeof(unsigned long),
.mode = 0644,
.proc\_handler = proc\_doulongvec\_minmax,
},
Reproduce:
When passing two parameters, it's work normal. But passing only one
parameter, an error "Invalid argument"(EINVAL) is returned.
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 1 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
1 2
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
[root@cl150 ~]# echo $?
1
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
3 2
[root@cl150 ~]#
The following is the result after apply this patch. No error is
returned when the number of input parameters is less than the total
parameters.
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 1 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
1 2
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
[root@cl150 ~]# echo $?
0
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
3 2
[root@cl150 ~]#
There are three processing functions dealing with digital parameters,
\_\_do\_proc\_dointvec/\_\_do\_proc\_douintvec/\_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax.
This patch deals with \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax, just as
\_\_do\_proc\_dointvec does, adding a check for parameters 'left'. In
\_\_do\_proc\_douintvec, its code implementation explicitly does not support
multiple inputs.
static int \_\_do\_proc\_douintvec(...){
...
/\*
\* Arrays are not supported, keep this simple. \*Do not\* add
\* support for them.
\*/
if (vleft != 1) {
\*lenp = 0;
return -EINVAL;
}
...
}
So, just \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax has the problem. And most use of
proc\_doulongvec\_minmax/proc\_doulongvec\_ms\_jiffies\_minmax just have one
parameter.

kernel/hung\_task.c: break RCU locks based on jiffies
[ Upstream commit 304ae42739b108305f8d7b3eb3c1aec7c2b643a9 ]
check\_hung\_uninterruptible\_tasks() is currently calling rcu\_lock\_break()
for every 1024 threads. But check\_hung\_task() is very slow if printk()
was called, and is very fast otherwise.
If many threads within some 1024 threads called printk(), the RCU grace
period might be extended enough to trigger RCU stall warnings.
Therefore, calling rcu\_lock\_break() for every some fixed jiffies will be
safer.

arm64/sve: ptrace: Fix SVE\_PT\_REGS\_OFFSET definition
[ Upstream commit ee1b465b303591d3a04d403122bbc0d7026520fb ]
SVE\_PT\_REGS\_OFFSET is supposed to indicate the offset for skipping
over the ptrace NT\_ARM\_SVE header (struct user\_sve\_header) to the
start of the SVE register data proper.
However, currently SVE\_PT\_REGS\_OFFSET is defined in terms of struct
sve\_context, which is wrong: that structure describes the SVE
header in the signal frame, not in the ptrace regset.
This patch fixes the definition to use the ptrace header structure
struct user\_sve\_header instead.
By good fortune, the two structures are the same size anyway, so
there is no functional or ABI change.

thermal: generic-adc: Fix adc to temp interpolation

First correct the edge case to return the last element if we're
outside the range, rather than at the last element, so that
interpolation is not omitted for points between the two last entries in
the table.
Then correct the formula to perform linear interpolation based the two
points surrounding the read ADC value. The indices for temp are kept as
"hi" and "lo" to pair with the adc indices, but there's no requirement
that the temperature is provided in descendent order. mult\_frac() is
used to prevent issues with overflowing the int.

PCI: imx: Enable MSI from downstream components
[ Upstream commit 75cb8d20c112aba70f23d98e3f8d0a38ace16006 ]
The MSI Enable bit in the MSI Capability (PCIe r4.0, sec 7.7.1.2) controls
whether a Function can request service using MSI.
i.MX6 Root Ports implement the MSI Capability and may use MSI to request
service for events like PME, hotplug, AER, etc. In addition, on i.MX6, the
MSI Enable bit controls delivery of MSI interrupts from components below
the Root Port.
Prior to f3fdfc4ac3a2 ("PCI: Remove host driver Kconfig selection of
CONFIG\_PCIEPORTBUS"), enabling CONFIG\_PCI\_IMX6 automatically also enabled
CONFIG\_PCIEPORTBUS, and when portdrv claimed the Root Ports, it set the MSI
Enable bit so it could use PME, hotplug, AER, etc. As a side effect, that
also enabled delivery of MSI interrupts from downstream components.
The imx6q-pcie driver itself does not depend on portdrv, so set MSI Enable
in imx6q-pcie so MSI from downstream components works even if nobody uses
MSI for the Root Port events.

gdrom: fix a memory leak bug
[ Upstream commit 093c48213ee37c3c3ff1cf5ac1aa2a9d8bc66017 ]
In probe\_gdrom(), the buffer pointed by 'gd.cd\_info' is allocated through
kzalloc() and is used to hold the information of the gdrom device. To
register and unregister the device, the pointer 'gd.cd\_info' is passed to
the functions register\_cdrom() and unregister\_cdrom(), respectively.
However, this buffer is not freed after it is used, which can cause a
memory leak bug.
This patch simply frees the buffer 'gd.cd\_info' in exit\_gdrom() to fix the
above issue.

zram: fix lockdep warning of free block handling
[ Upstream commit 3c9959e025472122a61faebb208525cf26b305d1 ]
Patch series "zram idle page writeback", v3.
Inherently, swap device has many idle pages which are rare touched since
it was allocated. It is never problem if we use storage device as swap.
However, it's just waste for zram-swap.
This patchset supports zram idle page writeback feature.
\* Admin can define what is idle page "no access since X time ago"
\* Admin can define when zram should writeback them
\* Admin can define when zram should stop writeback to prevent wearout
Details are in each patch's description.

With writeback feature, zram\_slot\_free\_notify could be called in softirq
context by end\_swap\_bio\_read. However, bitmap\_lock is not aware of that
so lockdep yell out:
get\_entry\_bdev
spin\_lock(bitmap->lock);
irq
softirq
end\_swap\_bio\_read
zram\_slot\_free\_notify
zram\_slot\_lock <-- deadlock prone
zram\_free\_page
put\_entry\_bdev
spin\_lock(bitmap->lock); <-- deadlock prone
With akpm's suggestion (i.e. bitmap operation is already atomic), we
could remove bitmap lock. It might fail to find a empty slot if serious
contention happens. However, it's not severe problem because huge page
writeback has already possiblity to fail if there is severe memory
pressure. Worst case is just keeping the incompressible in memory, not
storage.
The other problem is zram\_slot\_lock in zram\_slot\_slot\_free\_notify. To
make it safe is this patch introduces zram\_slot\_trylock where
zram\_slot\_free\_notify uses it. Although it's rare to be contented, this
patch adds new debug stat "miss\_free" to keep monitoring how often it
happens.

mm/page\_alloc.c: don't call kasan\_free\_pages() at deferred mem init
[ Upstream commit 3c0c12cc8f00ca5f81acb010023b8eb13e9a7004 ]
When CONFIG\_KASAN is enabled on large memory SMP systems, the deferrred
pages initialization can take a long time. Below were the reported init
times on a 8-socket 96-core 4TB IvyBridge system.
1) Non-debug kernel without CONFIG\_KASAN
[ 8.764222] node 1 initialised, 132086516 pages in 7027ms
2) Debug kernel with CONFIG\_KASAN
[ 146.288115] node 1 initialised, 132075466 pages in 143052ms
So the page init time in a debug kernel was 20X of the non-debug kernel.
The long init time can be problematic as the page initialization is done
with interrupt disabled. In this particular case, it caused the
appearance of following warning messages as well as NMI backtraces of all
the cores that were doing the initialization.
[ 68.240049] rcu: INFO: rcu\_sched detected stalls on CPUs/tasks:

[ 68.241000] rcu: (detected by 13, t=65018 jiffies, g=249, q=2)
The long init time was mainly caused by the call to kasan\_free\_pages() to
poison the newly initialized pages. On a 4TB system, we are talking about
almost 500GB of memory probably on the same node.
In reality, we may not need to poison the newly initialized pages before
they are ever allocated. So KASAN poisoning of freed pages before the
completion of deferred memory initialization is now disabled. Those pages
will be properly poisoned when they are allocated or freed after deferred
pages initialization is done.
With this change, the new page initialization time became:
[ 21.948010] node 1 initialised, 132075466 pages in 18702ms
This was still about double the non-debug kernel time, but was much
better than before.

ocfs2: improve ocfs2 Makefile
[ Upstream commit 9e6aea22802b5684c7e1d69822aeb0844dd01953 ]
Included file path was hard-wired in the ocfs2 makefile, which might
causes some confusion when compiling ocfs2 as an external module.
Say if we compile ocfs2 module as following.
cp -r /kernel/tree/fs/ocfs2 /other/dir/ocfs2
cd /other/dir/ocfs2
make -C /path/to/kernel\_source M=`pwd` modules
Acutally, the compiler wil try to find included file in
/kernel/tree/fs/ocfs2, rather than the directory /other/dir/ocfs2.
To fix this little bug, we introduce the var $(src) provided by kbuild.
$(src) means the absolute path of the running kbuild file.

ocfs2: don't clear bh uptodate for block read
[ Upstream commit 70306d9dce75abde855cefaf32b3f71eed8602a3 ]
For sync io read in ocfs2\_read\_blocks\_sync(), first clear bh uptodate flag
and submit the io, second wait io done, last check whether bh uptodate, if
not return io error.
If two sync io for the same bh were issued, it could be the first io done
and set uptodate flag, but just before check that flag, the second io came
in and cleared uptodate, then ocfs2\_read\_blocks\_sync() for the first io
will return IO error.
Indeed it's not necessary to clear uptodate flag, as the io end handler
end\_buffer\_read\_sync() will set or clear it based on io succeed or failed.
The following message was found from a nfs server but the underlying
storage returned no error.

perf python: Do not force closing original perf descriptor in evlist.get\_pollfd()
[ Upstream commit a389aece97938966616ce0336466b98b0351ef10 ]
Ondřej reported that when compiled with python3, the python extension
regresses in evlist.get\_pollfd function behaviour.
The evlist.get\_pollfd function creates file objects from evlist's fds
and returns them in a list. The python3 version also sets them to 'close
the original descriptor' when the object dies (is closed), by passing
True via the 'closefd' arg in the PyFile\_FromFd call.
The python's closefd doc says:
If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
when the file is closed.
That's why the following line in python3 closes all evlist fds:
evlist.get\_pollfd()
the returned list is immediately destroyed and that takes down the
original events fds.
Passing closefd as False to PyFile\_FromFd to fix this.

f2fs: fix sbi->extent\_list corruption issue

retries again. This time the mount is successful, but the files

near the end of system memory. And with CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI
disabled, trap\_init() will not allocate a new area to place the
exception handler. The original value will be used and the handler
will be copied to this location, which might already be used by some
userspace application.
The MT7688 supports VI - its config3 register is 0x00002420, so VInt
(Bit 5) is set. But without setting CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI this
bit will not be evaluated to result in "cpu\_has\_vi" being set. This
patch now selects CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI on MT7620/8 which results
trap\_init() to allocate some memory for the exception handler.
Please note that this issue was not seen with the Mediatek U-Boot
version, as it does not touch EBase (stays at default of 0x8000.0000).
This is strictly also not correct as the kernel (\_text) resides
here.

seq\_buf: Make seq\_buf\_puts() null-terminate the buffer
[ Upstream commit 0464ed24380905d640030d368cd84a4e4d1e15e2 ]
Currently seq\_buf\_puts() will happily create a non null-terminated
string for you in the buffer. This is particularly dangerous if the
buffer is on the stack.
For example:
char buf[8];
char secret = "secret";
struct seq\_buf s;
seq\_buf\_init(&s, buf, sizeof(buf));
seq\_buf\_puts(&s, "foo");
printk("Message is %s\n", buf);
Can result in:
Message is fooªªªªªsecret
We could require all users to memset() their buffer to zero before
use. But that seems likely to be forgotten and lead to bugs.
Instead we can change seq\_buf\_puts() to always leave the buffer in a
null-terminated state.
The only downside is that this makes the buffer 1 character smaller
for seq\_buf\_puts(), but that seems like a good trade off.

perf build: Don't unconditionally link the libbfd feature test to -liberty and -lz
[ Upstream commit 14541b1e7e723859ff2c75c6fc10cdbbec6b8c34 ]
Current libbfd feature test unconditionally links against -liberty and -lz.
While it's required on some systems (e.g. opensuse), it's completely
unnecessary on the others, where only -lbdf is sufficient (debian).
This patch streamlines (and renames) the following feature checks:
feature-libbfd - only link against -lbfd (debian),
see commit 2cf9040714f3 ("perf tools: Fix bfd
dependency libraries detection")
feature-libbfd-liberty - link against -lbfd and -liberty
feature-libbfd-liberty-z - link against -lbfd, -liberty and -lz (opensuse),
see commit 280e7c48c3b8 ("perf tools: fix BFD
detection on opensuse")
(feature-liberty{,-z} were renamed to feature-libbfd-liberty{,z}
for clarity)
The main motivation is to fix this feature test for bpftool which is
currently broken on debian (libbfd feature shows OFF, but we still
unconditionally link against -lbfd and it works).
Tested on debian with only -lbfd installed (without -liberty); I'd
appreciate if somebody on the other systems can test this new detection
method.

NFS: nfs\_compare\_mount\_options always compare auth flavors.
[ Upstream commit 594d1644cd59447f4fceb592448d5cd09eb09b5e ]
This patch removes the check from nfs\_compare\_mount\_options to see if a
`sec' option was passed for the current mount before comparing auth
flavors and instead just always compares auth flavors.
Consider the following scenario:
You have a server with the address 192.168.1.1 and two exports /export/a
and /export/b. The first export supports `sys' and `krb5' security, the
second just `sys'.
Assume you start with no mounts from the server.
The following results in EIOs being returned as the kernel nfs client
incorrectly thinks it can share the underlying `struct nfs\_server's:
$ mkdir /tmp/{a,b}
$ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3,sec=krb5 192.168.1.1:/export/a /tmp/a
$ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3 192.168.1.1:/export/b /tmp/b

powerpc/fadump: Do not allow hot-remove memory from fadump reserved area.
[ Upstream commit 0db6896ff6332ba694f1e61b93ae3b2640317633 ]
For fadump to work successfully there should not be any holes in reserved
memory ranges where kernel has asked firmware to move the content of old
kernel memory in event of crash. Now that fadump uses CMA for reserved
area, this memory area is now not protected from hot-remove operations
unless it is cma allocated. Hence, fadump service can fail to re-register
after the hot-remove operation, if hot-removed memory belongs to fadump
reserved region. To avoid this make sure that memory from fadump reserved
area is not hot-removable if fadump is registered.
However, if user still wants to remove that memory, he can do so by
manually stopping fadump service before hot-remove operation.

i40iw\_net\_event() reads unconditionally 16 bytes from

But the driver does not setup dev->neigh\_priv\_len and

fbdev: fbmem: behave better with small rotated displays and many CPUs
[ Upstream commit f75df8d4b4fabfad7e3cba2debfad12741c6fde7 ]
Blitting an image with "negative" offsets is not working since there
is no clipping. It hopefully just crashes. For the bootup logo, there
is protection so that blitting does not happen as the image is drawn
further and further to the right (ROTATE\_UR) or further and further
down (ROTATE\_CW). There is however no protection when drawing in the
opposite directions (ROTATE\_UD and ROTATE\_CCW).
Add back this protection.
The regression is 20-odd years old but the mindless warning-killing
mentality displayed in commit 34bdb666f4b2 ("fbdev: fbmem: remove
positive test on unsigned values") is also to blame, methinks.

So resync io is waiting for regular write io to complete to
decrease nr\_pending (conf->barrier++ is called before waiting).
The regular write io splits another bio after call wait\_barrier
which call nr\_pending++, then the splitted bio would continue
with raid10\_write\_request -> wait\_barrier, so the splitted bio
has to wait for barrier to be zero, then deadlock happens as
follows.
resync io regular io
raise\_barrier
wait\_barrier
generic\_make\_request
wait\_barrier
To resolve the issue, we need to call allow\_barrier to decrease
nr\_pending before generic\_make\_request since regular IO is not
issued to underlying devices, and wait\_barrier is called again
to ensure no internal IO happening.

drbd: skip spurious timeout (ping-timeo) when failing promote
[ Upstream commit 9848b6ddd8c92305252f94592c5e278574e7a6ac ]
If you try to promote a Secondary while connected to a Primary
and allow-two-primaries is NOT set, we will wait for "ping-timeout"
to give this node a chance to detect a dead primary,
in case the cluster manager noticed faster than we did.
But if we then are \*still\* connected to a Primary,
we fail (after an additional timeout of ping-timout).
This change skips the spurious second timeout.
Most people won't notice really,
since "ping-timeout" by default is half a second.
But in some installations, ping-timeout may be 10 or 20 seconds or more,
and spuriously delaying the error return becomes annoying.

drbd: disconnect, if the wrong UUIDs are attached on a connected peer
[ Upstream commit b17b59602b6dcf8f97a7dc7bc489a48388d7063a ]
With "on-no-data-accessible suspend-io", DRBD requires the next attach
or connect to be to the very same data generation uuid tag it lost last.
If we first lost connection to the peer,
then later lost connection to our own disk,
we would usually refuse to re-connect to the peer,
because it presents the wrong data set.
However, if the peer first connects without a disk,
and then attached its disk, we accepted that same wrong data set,
which would be "unexpected" by any user of that DRBD
and cause "undefined results" (read: very likely data corruption).
The fix is to forcefully disconnect as soon as we notice that the peer
attached to the "wrong" dataset.

So far there was the possibility that we called

This included cases like:
drbd\_sync\_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
drbd\_asb\_recover\_1p
drbd\_khelper
drbd\_bcast\_event
genlmsg\_new(GFP\_NOIO) --> may sleep

genlmsg\_new(GFP\_NOIO) --> may sleep
drbd\_sync\_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
drbd\_asb\_recover\_1p
drbd\_khelper
notify\_helper
mutex\_lock --> may sleep
While using GFP\_ATOMIC whould have been possible in the first two cases,
the real fix is to narrow the rcu\_read\_lock.

mlx5: update timecounter at least twice per counter overflow
[ Upstream commit 5d8678365c90b9ce1fd2243ff5ea562609f6cec1 ]
The timecounter needs to be updated at least once in half of the
cyclecounter interval to prevent timecounter\_cyc2time() interpreting a
new timestamp as an old value and causing a backward jump.
This would be an issue if the timecounter multiplier was so small that
the update interval would not be limited by the 64-bit overflow in
multiplication.
Shorten the calculated interval to make sure the timecounter is updated
in time even when the system clock is slowed down by up to 10%, the
multiplier is increased by up to 10%, and the scheduled overflow check
is late by 15%.

however it missed the other table so it has still been fully allocated

implies ppe should be used for BPSK (mcs 0). If there are no PPE
thresholds in the IE, or if for some NSS-RU pair there's no threshold
set for it (this could happen because it's a variable-sized field), it
means no PPE should not be used for that pair, so the value sent to FW

[ Upstream commit 4f68ef64cd7feb1220232bd8f501d8aad340a099 ]
The function cw1200\_bss\_info\_changed() and cw1200\_hw\_scan() can be
concurrently executed.
The two functions both access a possible shared variable "frame.skb".
This shared variable is freed by dev\_kfree\_skb() in cw1200\_upload\_beacon(),
which is called by cw1200\_bss\_info\_changed(). The free operation is
protected by a mutex lock "priv->conf\_mutex" in cw1200\_bss\_info\_changed().
In cw1200\_hw\_scan(), this shared variable is accessed without the
protection of the mutex lock "priv->conf\_mutex".
Thus, concurrency use-after-free bugs may occur.
To fix these bugs, the original calls to mutex\_lock(&priv->conf\_mutex) and
mutex\_unlock(&priv->conf\_mutex) are moved to the places, which can
protect the accesses to the shared variable.

mlxsw: spectrum: Properly cleanup LAG uppers when removing port from LAG
[ Upstream commit be2d6f421f680e01d58f7cd452646e0d8586d49b ]
When a LAG device or a VLAN device on top of it is enslaved to a bridge,
the driver propagates the CHANGEUPPER event to the LAG's slaves.
This causes each physical port to increase the reference count of the
internal representation of the bridge port by calling
mlxsw\_sp\_port\_bridge\_join().
However, when a port is removed from a LAG, the corresponding leave()
function is not called and the reference count is not decremented. This
leads to ugly hacks such as mlxsw\_sp\_bridge\_port\_should\_destroy() that
try to understand if the bridge port should be destroyed even when its
reference count is not 0.
Instead, make sure that when a port is unlinked from a LAG it would see
the same events as if the LAG (or its uppers) were unlinked from a
bridge.
The above is achieved by walking the LAG's uppers when a port is
unlinked and calling mlxsw\_sp\_port\_bridge\_leave() for each upper that is
enslaved to a bridge.

mac80211: fix radiotap vendor presence bitmap handling
[ Upstream commit efc38dd7d5fa5c8cdd0c917c5d00947aa0539443 ]
Due to the alignment handling, it actually matters where in the code
we add the 4 bytes for the presence bitmap to the length; the first
field is the timestamp with 8 byte alignment so we need to add the
space for the extra vendor namespace presence bitmap \*before\* we do
any alignment for the fields.
Move the presence bitmap length accounting to the right place to fix
the alignment for the data properly.

[ Upstream commit 12750d1647f118496f1da727146f255f5e44d500 ]
[Why]
YCbCr420 packing format uses two chanels for luma, and 1
channel for both chroma component. Our previous implementation
did not account for this and results in every other pixel having
very high luma value, showing greyish color instead of black.
YCbCr444 = ;  .....

Program the second channel with the black color value for luma

usb: musb: dsps: fix otg state machine
[ Upstream commit 6010abf2c2c0e382d7e8ee44bd11f343aae90cce ]
Due to lack of ID pin interrupt event on AM335x devices, the musb dsps
driver uses polling to detect usb device attach for dual-role port.
But in the case if a micro-A cable adapter is attached without a USB device
attached to the cable, the musb state machine gets stuck in a\_wait\_vrise
state waiting for the MUSB\_CONNECT interrupt which won't happen due to the
usb device is not attached. The state is stuck in a\_wait\_vrise even after
the micro-A cable is detached, which could cause VBUS retention if then the
dual-role port is attached to a host port.
To fix the problem, make a\_wait\_vrise as a transient state, then move the
state to either a\_wait\_bcon for host port or a\_idle state for dual-role
port, if no usb device is attached to the port.

arm64: KVM: Skip MMIO insn after emulation
[ Upstream commit 0d640732dbebed0f10f18526de21652931f0b2f2 ]
When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
decode\_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.
Having this logic in decode\_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.
Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state \*after\* the effects of the
instruction are emulated.

[ Upstream commit 36d65be9a88052cdfc8524eb591baf0e6c878408 ]
When bringing up a device, the code checks to see if the number of
MSIX has changed. pci\_disable\_msix() should be called first before
changing the number of reserved NQs/CMPL rings. This ensures that
the MSIX vectors associated with the NQs/CMPL rings are still
properly mapped when pci\_disable\_msix() masks the vectors.
This patch will prevent errors when RDMA support is added for the new
57500 chips. When the RDMA driver shuts down, the number of NQs is
decreased and we must use the new sequence to prevent MSIX errors.

perf probe: Fix unchecked usage of strncpy()
[ Upstream commit bef0b8970f27da5ca223e522a174d03e2587761d ]
The strncpy() function may leave the destination string buffer
unterminated, better use strlcpy() that we have a \_\_weak fallback
implementation for systems without it.
In this case the 'target' buffer is coming from a list of build-ids that
are expected to have a len of at most (SBUILD\_ID\_SIZE - 1) chars, so
probably we're safe, but since we're using strncpy() here, use strlcpy()
instead to provide the intended safety checking without the using the
problematic strncpy() function.
This fixes this warning on an Alpine Linux Edge system with gcc 8.2:

btrfs: use tagged writepage to mitigate livelock of snapshot
[ Upstream commit 3cd24c698004d2f7668e0eb9fc1f096f533c791b ]
Snapshot is expected to be fast. But if there are writers steadily
creating dirty pages in our subvolume, the snapshot may take a very long
time to complete. To fix the problem, we use tagged writepage for
snapshot flusher as we do in the generic write\_cache\_pages(), so we can
omit pages dirtied after the snapshot command.
This does not change the semantics regarding which data get to the
snapshot, if there are pages being dirtied during the snapshotting
operation. There's a sync called before snapshot is taken in old/new
case, any IO in flight just after that may be in the snapshot but this
depends on other system effects that might still sync the IO.
We do a simple snapshot speed test on a Intel D-1531 box:
fio --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=32 --bs=4k --rw=write --size=64G
--direct=0 --thread=1 --numjobs=1 --time\_based --runtime=120
--filename=/mnt/sub/testfile --name=job1 --group\_reporting & sleep 5;
time btrfs sub snap -r /mnt/sub /mnt/snap; killall fio
original: 1m58sec
patched: 6.54sec
This is the best case for this patch since for a sequential write case,
we omit nearly all pages dirtied after the snapshot command.
For a multi writers, random write test:
fio --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=32 --bs=4k --rw=randwrite --size=64G
--direct=0 --thread=1 --numjobs=4 --time\_based --runtime=120
--filename=/mnt/sub/testfile --name=job1 --group\_reporting & sleep 5;
time btrfs sub snap -r /mnt/sub /mnt/snap; killall fio
original: 15.83sec
patched: 10.35sec
The improvement is smaller compared to the sequential write case,
since we omit only half of the pages dirtied after snapshot command.

[ Upstream commit 71ab1c0336c71ace5725740f200beca9667a339f ]
On (H)SCIF, sci\_submit\_rx() is called in the receive interrupt handler.
Hence if DMA submission fails, the interrupt handler should resume
handling reception using PIO, else no more data is received.
Make sci\_submit\_rx() return an error indicator, so the receive interrupt
handler can act appropriately.

serial: sh-sci: Fix locking in sci\_submit\_rx()
[ Upstream commit dd1f2250da95e87cb3e612858f94b14f99445a7c ]
Some callers of sci\_submit\_rx() hold the port spinlock, others don't.
During fallback to PIO, the driver needs to obtain the port spinlock.
If the lock was already held, spinlock recursion is detected, causing a
deadlock: BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0.
Fix this by adding a flag parameter to sci\_submit\_rx() for the caller to
indicate the port spinlock is already held, so spinlock recursion can be
avoided.
Move the spin\_lock\_irqsave() up, so all DMA disable steps are protected,
which is safe as the recently introduced dmaengine\_terminate\_async() can
be called in atomic context.

btrfs: harden agaist duplicate fsid on scanned devices
[ Upstream commit a9261d4125c97ce8624e9941b75dee1b43ad5df9 ]
It's not that impossible to imagine that a device OR a btrfs image is
copied just by using the dd or the cp command. Which in case both the
copies of the btrfs will have the same fsid. If on the system with
automount enabled, the copied FS gets scanned.
We have a known bug in btrfs, that we let the device path be changed
after the device has been mounted. So using this loop hole the new
copied device would appears as if its mounted immediately after it's
been copied.
For example:
Initially.. /dev/mmcblk0p4 is mounted as /
$ lsblk
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
mmcblk0 179:0 0 29.2G 0 disk
|-mmcblk0p4 179:4 0 4G 0 part /
|-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 500M 0 part /boot
|-mmcblk0p3 179:3 0 256M 0 part [SWAP]
`-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot/efi
$ btrfs fi show
Label: none uuid: 07892354-ddaa-4443-90ea-f76a06accaba
Total devices 1 FS bytes used 1.40GiB
devid 1 size 4.00GiB used 3.00GiB path /dev/mmcblk0p4
Copy mmcblk0 to sda
$ dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/sda
And immediately after the copy completes the change in the device
superblock is notified which the automount scans using btrfs device scan
and the new device sda becomes the mounted root device.
$ lsblk
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda 8:0 1 14.9G 0 disk
|-sda4 8:4 1 4G 0 part /
|-sda2 8:2 1 500M 0 part
|-sda3 8:3 1 256M 0 part
`-sda1 8:1 1 256M 0 part
mmcblk0 179:0 0 29.2G 0 disk
|-mmcblk0p4 179:4 0 4G 0 part
|-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 500M 0 part /boot
|-mmcblk0p3 179:3 0 256M 0 part [SWAP]
`-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot/efi
$ btrfs fi show /
Label: none uuid: 07892354-ddaa-4443-90ea-f76a06accaba
Total devices 1 FS bytes used 1.40GiB
devid 1 size 4.00GiB used 3.00GiB path /dev/sda4
The bug is quite nasty that you can't either unmount /dev/sda4 or
/dev/mmcblk0p4. And the problem does not get solved until you take sda
out of the system on to another system to change its fsid using the
'btrfstune -u' command.

[ Upstream commit 07d405769afea5718529fc9e341f0b13b3189b6f ]
If the user issues an "mmc extcsd read", the SD controller receives
what it thinks is a SEND\_IF\_COND command with an unexpected data block.
The resulting operations leave the FSM stuck in READWAIT, a state which
persists until the MMC framework resets the controller, by which point
the root filesystem is likely to have been unmounted.
A less heavyweight solution is to detect the condition and nudge the
FSM by asserting the (self-clearing) FORCE\_DATA\_MODE bit.

i2c-axxia: check for error conditions first
[ Upstream commit 4f5c85fe3a60ace555d09898166af372547f97fc ]
It was observed that when using seqentional mode contrary to the
documentation, the SS bit (which is supposed to only be set if
automatic/sequence command completed normally), is sometimes set
together with NA (NAK in address phase) causing transfer to falsely be
considered successful.
My assumption is that this does not happen during manual mode since the
controller is stopping its work the moment it sets NA/ND bit in status
register. This is not the case in Automatic/Sequentional mode where it
is still working to send STOP condition and the actual status we get
depends on the time when the ISR is run.
This patch changes the order of checking status bits in ISR - error
conditions are checked first and only if none of them occurred, the
transfer may be considered successful. This is required to introduce
using of sequentional mode in next patch.

then checks req->busy which is false, at last run list\_del(&req->link).
This triggers double list\_del() and results kernel panic.
For solve this problem, we rename req->busy to req->in\_queue, and
associate it with state of whether req is linked to supp->reqs. So we
can just only check req->in\_queue to make decision calling list\_del()
or not.

OPP: Use opp\_table->regulators to verify no regulator case
[ Upstream commit 90e3577b5feb42bac1269e16bb3d2bdd8f6df40f ]
The value of opp\_table->regulator\_count is not very consistent right now
and it may end up being 0 while we do have a "opp-microvolt" property in
the OPP table. It was kept that way as we used to check if any
regulators are set with the OPP core for a device or not using value of
regulator\_count.
Lets use opp\_table->regulators for that purpose as the meaning of
regulator\_count is going to change in the later patches.

This fix is relevant for the same new systems MQMB7, MSN37, MSN34,
which are about to be released to the customers.
At the moment, none of them is at customers sites. The customers will
not suffer from this change.
This fix is necessary, because register used before for tachometer 7
has been than reserved for the second PWM for newer systems, which are
not supported yet in mlx-platform driver. So registers of tachometers
7-12 have been shifted by one.

iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use explicit mb() when moving cons pointer
[ Upstream commit a868e8530441286342f90c1fd9c5f24de3aa2880 ]
After removing an entry from a queue (e.g. reading an event in
arm\_smmu\_evtq\_thread()) it is necessary to advance the MMIO consumer
pointer to free the queue slot back to the SMMU. A memory barrier is
required here so that all reads targetting the queue entry have
completed before the consumer pointer is updated.
The implementation of queue\_inc\_cons() relies on a writel() to complete
the previous reads, but this is incorrect because writel() is only
guaranteed to complete prior writes. This patch replaces the call to
writel() with an mb(); writel\_relaxed() sequence, which gives us the
read->write ordering which we require.

iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Avoid memory corruption from Hisilicon MSI payloads
[ Upstream commit 84a9a75774961612d0c7dd34a1777e8f98a65abd ]
The GITS\_TRANSLATER MMIO doorbell register in the ITS hardware is
architected to be 4 bytes in size, yet on hi1620 and earlier, Hisilicon
have allocated the adjacent 4 bytes to carry some IMPDEF sideband
information which results in an 8-byte MSI payload being delivered when
signalling an interrupt:
MSIAddr:
|----4bytes----|----4bytes----|
| MSIData | IMPDEF |
This poses no problem for the ITS hardware because the adjacent 4 bytes
are reserved in the memory map. However, when delivering MSIs to memory,
as we do in the SMMUv3 driver for signalling the completion of a SYNC
command, the extended payload will corrupt the 4 bytes adjacent to the
"sync\_count" member in struct arm\_smmu\_device. Fortunately, the current
layout allocates these bytes to padding, but this is fragile and we
should make this explicit.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Disable CSP for stream OUT ep
[ Upstream commit 244add8ebfb231c39db9e33b204bd0ce8f24f782 ]
In stream mode, when fast-forwarding TRBs, the stream number
is not cleared causing the new stream to not get assigned. So
we don't want controller to carry on transfers when short packet
is received. So disable the CSP for stream capable endpoint.
This is based on the 3.30a Programming guide, where table 3-1
device descriptor structure field definitions says for CSP bit
If this bit is 0, the controller generates an XferComplete event
and remove the stream. So if we keep CSP as 1 then switching between
streams would not happen as in stream mode, when fast-forwarding
TRBs, the stream number is not cleared causing the new stream to not get
assigned.

mtd1: 01f40000 00020000 "upgrade"

mtd5: 00020000 00020000 "LangPack"
mtd6: 02000000 00020000 "flash"
Here "flash" is obviously the whole device and we know "rootfs"
is a bogus hack to point to a squashfs rootfs inside of the main
"upgrade partition". We know "RedBoot" is the first 0x40000 of
the flash and the "upgrade" partition follows from 0x40000 to
0x1f8000. So we have mtd0, 1, 4 and 6 covered.
Remains:
mtd2: 00040000 00020000 "rgdb"
mtd3: 00020000 00020000 "nvram"
mtd5: 00020000 00020000 "LangPack"
Inspecting the flash at 0x1f8000 and 0x1fa000 reveals each of

"rgdb" of 0x40000.

ARM: dts: Fix OMAP4430 SDP Ethernet startup
[ Upstream commit 84fb6c7feb1494ebb7d1ec8b95cfb7ada0264465 ]
It was noticed that unbinding and rebinding the KSZ8851 ethernet
resulted in the driver reporting "failed to read device ID" at probe.
Probing the reset line with a 'scope while repeatedly attempting to
bind the driver in a shell loop revealed that the KSZ8851 RSTN pin is
constantly held at zero, meaning the device is held in reset, and
does not respond on the SPI bus.
Experimentation with the startup delay on the regulator set to 50ms
shows that the reset is positively released after 20ms.
Schematics for this board are not available, and the traces are buried
in the inner layers of the board which makes tracing where the RSTN pin
extremely difficult. We can only guess that the RSTN pin is wired to a
reset generator chip driven off the ethernet supply, which fits the
observed behaviour.
Include this delay in the regulator startup delay - effectively
treating the reset as a "supply stable" indicator.
This can not be modelled as a delay in the KSZ8851 driver since the
reset generation is board specific - if the RSTN pin had been wired to
a GPIO, reset could be released earlier via the already provided support
in the KSZ8851 driver.
This also got confirmed by Peter Ujfalusi  based
on Blaze schematics that should be very close to SDP4430:
TPS22902YFPR is used as the regulator switch (gpio48 controlled):
Convert arm boot\_lock to raw The VOUT is routed to TPS3808G01DBV.
(SCH Note: Threshold set at 90%. Vsense: 0.405V).
According to the TPS3808 data sheet the RESET delay time when Ct is

anything to guarantee that a hotplug event that may occur while we are
doing the release of the driver will not be asynchronously scheduled.
By moving this into the driver\_detach path we can avoid potential deadlocks
as we aren't holding the device lock at this point and we should not have
the driver we want to flush loaded so the flush will take care of any
asynchronous events the driver we are detaching might have scheduled.

tipc: fix node keep alive interval calculation

base on the LINK with lowest tolerance.
But when calculated, the old node timer interval only updated if current
setting value (tolerance/4) less than old ones regardless of number of
links as well as links' lowest tolerance value.
This caused to two cases missing if tolerance changed as following:
Case 1:
1.1/ There is one link (L1) available in the system
1.2/ Set L1's tolerance from 1500ms => lower (i.e 500ms)
1.3/ Then, fallback to default (1500ms) or higher (i.e 2000ms)
Expected:
node timer interval is 1500/4=375ms after 1.3
Result:
node timer interval will not being updated after changing tolerance at 1.3
since its value 1500/4=375ms is not less than 500/4=125ms at 1.2.
Case 2:
2.1/ There are two links (L1, L2) available in the system
2.2/ L1 and L2 tolerance value are 2000ms as initial
2.3/ Set L2's tolerance from 2000ms => lower 1500ms
2.4/ Disable link L2 (bring down its bearer)
Expected:
node timer interval is 2000ms/4=500ms after 2.4
Result:
node timer interval will not being updated after disabling L2 since
its value 2000ms/4=500ms is still not less than 1500/4=375ms at 2.3
although L2 is already not available in the system.
To fix this, we start the node interval calculation by initializing it to
a value larger than any conceivable calculated value. This way, the link
with the lowest tolerance will always determine the calculated value.

[ Upstream commit 6e6da2039c82271dd873b9ad2b902a692a7dd554 ]
All the audio interfaces on Allwinner SoCs need to change their module
clocks during operation, to switch between support for 44.1 kHz and 48
kHz family sample rates. The clock rate for the module clocks is
governed by their upstream audio PLL. The module clocks themselves only
have a gate, and sometimes a divider or mux. Thus any rate changes need
to be propagated upstream.
Set the CLK\_SET\_RATE\_PARENT flag for all audio module clocks to achieve
this.

[ Upstream commit e86108940e541febf35813402ff29fa6f4a9ac0b ]
When initializing a hub we want to give a USB3 port in link training
the same debounce delay time before autosuspening the hub as already
trained, connected enabled ports.
USB3 ports won't reach the enabled state with "current connect status" and
"connect status change" bits set until the USB3 link training finishes.
Catching the port in link training (polling) and adding the debounce delay
prevents unnecessary failed attempts to autosuspend the hub.

usb: dwc3: Correct the logic for checking TRB full in \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb()
[ Upstream commit b7a4fbe2300a8965ea760c7e871507b84aea17f6 ]
Availability of TRB's is calculated using dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left(), which
determines total available TRB's based on the HWO bit set in a TRB.
In the present code, \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb() is called with a TRB which
needs to be prepared for transfer. This \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb() calls
dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() to determine total available TRBs and set IOC bit
if the total available TRBs are zero. Since the present working TRB (which
is passed as an argument to \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb() ) doesn't yet have
the HWO bit set before calling dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left(), there are chances
that dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() wrongly calculates this present working TRB
as free(since the HWO bit is not yet set) and returns the total available
TRBs as greater than zero (including the present working TRB). This could
be a problem.
This patch corrects the above mentioned problem in \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb()
by increementing the dep->trb\_enqueue at the last (after preparing the TRB)
instead of increementing at the start and setting the IOC bit only if the
total available TRBs returned by dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() is 1 . Since we are
increementing the dep->trb\_enqueue at the last, the present working TRB is
also considered as available by dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() and non zero value is
returned . So, according to the modified logic, when the total available
TRBs is equal to 1 that means the total available TRBs in the pool are 0.

ARM: dts: mmp2: fix TWSI2
[ Upstream commit 1147e05ac9fc2ef86a3691e7ca5c2db7602d81dd ]
Marvell keeps their MMP2 datasheet secret, but there are good clues
that TWSI2 is not on 0xd4025000 on that platform, not does it use
IRQ 58. In fact, the IRQ 58 on MMP2 seems to be a signal processor:
arch/arm/mach-mmp/irqs.h:#define IRQ\_MMP2\_MSP 58
I'm taking a somewhat educated guess that is probably a copy & paste
error from PXA168 or PXA910 and that the real controller in fact hides
at address 0xd4031000 and uses an interrupt line multiplexed via IRQ 17.
I'm also copying some properties from TWSI1 that were missing or
incorrect.
Tested on a OLPC XO 1.75 machine, where the RTC is on TWSI2.

arm64: ftrace: don't adjust the LR value
[ Upstream commit 6e803e2e6e367db9a0d6ecae1bd24bb5752011bd ]
The core ftrace code requires that when it is handed the PC of an
instrumented function, this PC is the address of the instrumented
instruction. This is necessary so that the core ftrace code can identify
the specific instrumentation site. Since the instrumented function will
be a BL, the address of the instrumented function is LR - 4 at entry to
the ftrace code.
This fixup is applied in the mcount\_get\_pc and mcount\_get\_pc0 helpers,
which acquire the PC of the instrumented function.
The mcount\_get\_lr helper is used to acquire the LR of the instrumented
function, whose value does not require this adjustment, and cannot be
adjusted to anything meaningful. No adjustment of this value is made on
other architectures, including arm. However, arm64 adjusts this value by
4.
This patch brings arm64 in line with other architectures and removes the
adjustment of the LR value.

s390/zcrypt: improve special ap message cmd handling
[ Upstream commit be534791011100d204602e2e0496e9e6ce8edf63 ]
There exist very few ap messages which need to have the 'special' flag
enabled. This flag tells the firmware layer to do some pre- and maybe
postprocessing. However, it may happen that this special flag is
enabled but the firmware is unable to deal with this kind of message
and thus returns with reply code 0x41. For example older firmware may
not know the newest messages triggered by the zcrypt device driver and
thus react with reject and the named reply code. Unfortunately this
reply code is not known to the zcrypt error routines and thus default
behavior is to switch the ap queue offline.
This patch now makes the ap error routine aware of the reply code and
so userspace is informed about the bad processing result but the queue
is not switched to offline state any more.

Since commit:

we have a device driver accessing the efivars API. Several functions in
the efivars API assume \_\_efivars is set, i.e., that they will be accessed
only after efivars\_register() has been called. However, the following NULL
pointer access was reported calling efivar\_entry\_size() from the brcmfmac
device driver:

Disassembly showed that the local static variable \_\_efivars is NULL,
which is not entirely unexpected given that it is a non-EFI platform.
So add a NULL pointer check to efivar\_entry\_size(), and to related
functions while at it. In efivars\_register() a couple of sanity checks
are added as well.

Thermal: do not clear passive state during system sleep
[ Upstream commit 964f4843a455d2ffb199512b08be8d5f077c4cac ]
commit ff140fea847e ("Thermal: handle thermal zone device properly
during system sleep") added PM hook to call thermal zone reset during
sleep. However resetting thermal zone will also clear the passive state
and thus cancel the polling queue which leads the passive cooling device
state not being cleared properly after sleep.
thermal\_pm\_notify => thermal\_zone\_device\_reset set passive to 0
thermal\_zone\_trip\_update will skip update passive as `old\_target ==
instance->target'.
monitor\_thermal\_zone => thermal\_zone\_device\_set\_polling will cancel
tz->poll\_queue, so the cooling device state will not be changed
afterwards.

arm64: io: Ensure calls to delay routines are ordered against prior readX()
[ Upstream commit 6460d32014717686d3b7963595950ba2c6d1bb5e ]
A relatively standard idiom for ensuring that a pair of MMIO writes to a
device arrive at that device with a specified minimum delay between them
is as follows:
writel\_relaxed(42, dev\_base + CTL1);
readl(dev\_base + CTL1);
udelay(10);
writel\_relaxed(42, dev\_base + CTL2);
the intention being that the read-back from the device will push the
prior write to CTL1, and the udelay will hold up the write to CTL1 until
at least 10us have elapsed.
Unfortunately, on arm64 where the underlying delay loop is implemented
as a read of the architected counter, the CPU does not guarantee
ordering from the readl() to the delay loop and therefore the delay loop
could in theory be speculated and not provide the desired interval
between the two writes.
Fix this in a similar manner to PowerPC by introducing a dummy control
dependency on the output of readX() which, combined with the ISB in the
read of the architected counter, guarantees that a subsequent delay loop
can not be executed until the readX() has returned its result.

It is not considered compatible with existing fallback bindings

These registers are currently not used by the driver and
thus the provides the same behaviour for "renesas,iic-r8a77990" and
"renesas,rcar-gen3-iic". The point of declaring incompatibility is
to allow for automatic transmission register support to be added to

media: adv\*/tc358743/ths8200: fill in min width/height/pixelclock
[ Upstream commit 2912289a518077ddb8214e05336700148e97e235 ]
The v4l2\_dv\_timings\_cap struct is used to do sanity checks when setting and
enumerating DV timings, ensuring that only valid timings as per the HW
capabilities are allowed.
However, many drivers just filled in 0 for the minimum width, height or
pixelclock frequency. This can cause timings with e.g. 0 as width and height
to be accepted, which will in turn lead to a potential division by zero.
Fill in proper values are minimum boundaries. 640x350 was chosen since it is
the smallest resolution in v4l2-dv-timings.h. Same for 13 MHz as the lowest
pixelclock frequency (it's slightly below the minimum of 13.5 MHz in the
v4l2-dv-timings.h header).

iio: adc: meson-saradc: fix internal clock names
[ Upstream commit 50314f98b0ac468218e7c9af8c99f215a35436df ]
Before this patch we are registering the internal clocks (for example on
Meson8b, where the SAR ADC IP block implements the divider and gate
clocks) with the following names:
- /soc/cbus@c1100000/adc@8680#adc\_div
- /soc/cbus@c1100000/adc@8680#adc\_en
This is bad because the common clock framework uses the clock to create
a directory in /clk. With such name, the directory creation
(silently) fails and the debugfs entry ends up being created at the
debugfs root.
With this change, the new clock names are:
- c1108680.adc#adc\_div
- c1108680.adc#adc\_en
This matches the clock naming scheme used in the PWM, Ethernet and MMC
drivers. It also fixes the problem with debugfs.
The idea is shamelessly taken from commit b96e9eb62841c5 ("pwm: meson:
Fix mux clock names").

clk: meson: meson8b: mark the CPU clock as CLK\_IS\_CRITICAL
[ Upstream commit 0dad1ec65bc30a549aba38d34a727309bbf41bc8 ]
We don't want the common clock framework to disable the "cpu\_clk" if
it's not used by any device. The cpufreq-dt driver does not enable the
CPU clocks. However, even if it would we would still want the CPU clock
to be enabled at all times because the CPU clock is also required even
if we disable CPU frequency scaling on a specific board.
The reason why we want the CPU clock to be enabled is a clock further up
in the tree:
Since commit 6f888e7bc7bd58 ("clk: meson: clk-pll: add enable bit") the
sys\_pll can be disabled. However, since the CPU clock is derived from
sys\_pll we don't want sys\_pll to get disabled. The common clock
framework takes care of that for us by enabling all parent clocks of our
CPU clock when we mark the CPU clock with CLK\_IS\_CRITICAL.
Until now this is not a problem yet because all clocks in the CPU
clock's tree (including sys\_pll) are read-only. However, once we allow

clk: meson: meson8b: fix the width of the cpu\_scale\_div clock
[ Upstream commit a8662eadd1032018f31e37deda811790b2326662 ]
According to the public S805 datasheet HHI\_SYS\_CPU\_CLK\_CNTL1[29:20] is
the register for the CPU scale\_div clock. This matches the code in
Amlogic's 3.10 GPL kernel sources:
N = (aml\_read\_reg32(P\_HHI\_SYS\_CPU\_CLK\_CNTL1) >> 20) & 0x3FF;
This means that the divider register is 10 bit wide instead of 9 bits.
So far this is not a problem since all u-boot versions I have seen are
not using the cpu\_scale\_div clock at all (instead they are configuring
the CPU clock to run off cpu\_in\_sel directly).
The fixes tag points to the latest rework of the CPU clocks. However,
even before the rework it was wrong. Commit 7a29a869434e8b ("clk: meson:
Add support for Meson clock controller") defines MESON\_N\_WIDTH as 9 (in
drivers/clk/meson/clk-cpu.c). But since the old clk-cpu implementation
this only carries the fixes tag for the CPU clock rewordk.

clk: meson: meson8b: do not use cpu\_div3 for cpu\_scale\_out\_sel
[ Upstream commit a5ac1ead32c9aac285f6436e09b4f6111996e9b8 ]
The cpu\_div3 clock (cpu\_in divided by 3) generates a signal with a duty
cycle of 33%. The CPU clock however requires a clock signal with a duty
cycle of 50% to run stable.
cpu\_div3 was observed to be problematic when cycling through all
available CPU frequencies (with additional patches on top of this one)
while running "stress --cpu 4" in the background. This caused sporadic
hangs where the whole system would fully lock up.
Amlogic's 3.10 kernel code also does not use the cpu\_div3 clock either
when changing the CPU clock.

The video device release() callback for video-i2c driver frees the whole

when video\_unregister\_device() is called, the release callback is executed.
However, in video\_i2c\_remove() some fields (v4l2\_dev, lock, and queue\_lock)
in struct video\_i2c\_data are still accessed after video\_unregister\_device()
is called.
This fixes the use after free by moving the code from video\_i2c\_remove()

drm/amd/display: calculate stream->phy\_pix\_clk before clock mapping
[ Upstream commit 08e1c28dd521c7b08d1b0af0bae9fb22ccc012a4 ]
[why]
phy\_pix\_clk is one of the variable used to check if one PLL can be shared
with displays having common mode set configuration. As of now
phy\_pix\_clock varialbe is calculated in function dc\_validate\_stream().
dc\_validate\_stream() function is called after clocks are assigned for the
new display. Due to this during hotplug, when PLL sharing conditions are
checked for new display phy\_pix\_clk variable will be 0 and for displays
that are already enabled phy\_pix\_clk will have some value. Hence PLL will
not be shared and if the display hardware doesn't have any more PLL to
assign, mode set will fail due to resource unavailability.
[how]
Instead of only calculating the phy\_pix\_clk variable after the PLL is
assigned for new display, this patch calculates phy\_pix\_clk also during
the before assigning the PLL for new display.

drm/rockchip: fix for mailbox read size
[ Upstream commit fa68d4f8476bea4cdf441062b614b41bb85ef1da ]
Some of the functions (like cdn\_dp\_dpcd\_read, cdn\_dp\_get\_edid\_block)
allow to read 64KiB, but the cdn\_dp\_mailbox\_read\_receive, that is
used by them, can read only up to 255 bytes at once. Normally, it's
not a big issue as DPCD or EDID reads won't (hopefully) exceed that
value.
The real issue here is the revocation list read during the HDCP
authentication process. (problematic use case:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third\_party/kernel/+/chromeos-4.4/drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/cdn-dp-reg.c#1152)
The list can reach 127\*5+4 bytes (num devs \* 5 bytes per ID/Bksv +
4 bytes of an additional info).
In other words - CTSes with HDCP Repeater won't pass without this
fix. Oh, and the driver will most likely stop working (best case
scenario).

This adds a bit to set and check if a timeout recovery is already

platform/chrome: don't report EC\_MKBP\_EVENT\_SENSOR\_FIFO as wakeup
[ Upstream commit 6ad16b78a039b45294b1ad5d69c14ac57b2fe706 ]
EC\_MKBP\_EVENT\_SENSOR\_FIFO events can be triggered for a variety of
reasons, and there are very few cases in which they should be treated as
wakeup interrupts (particularly, when a certain
MOTIONSENSE\_MODULE\_FLAG\_\* is set, but this is not even supported in the
mainline cros\_ec\_sensor driver yet). Most of the time, they are benign
sensor readings. In any case, the top-level cros\_ec device doesn't know
enough to determine that they should wake the system, and so it should
not report the event. This would be the job of the cros\_ec\_sensors
driver to parse.
This patch adds checks to cros\_ec\_get\_next\_event() such that it doesn't
signal 'wakeup' for events of type EC\_MKBP\_EVENT\_SENSOR\_FIFO.
This patch is particularly relevant on devices like Scarlet (Rockchip
RK3399 tablet, known as Acer Chromebook Tab 10), where the EC firmware
reports sensor events much more frequently. This was causing
/sys/power/wakeup\_count to increase very frequently, often needlessly
interrupting our ability to suspend the system.

MIPS: Boston: Disable EG20T prefetch
[ Upstream commit 5ec17af7ead09701e23d2065e16db6ce4e137289 ]
The Intel EG20T Platform Controller Hub used on the MIPS Boston
development board supports prefetching memory to optimize DMA transfers.
Unfortunately for unknown reasons this doesn't work well with some MIPS
CPUs such as the P6600, particularly when using an I/O Coherence Unit
(IOCU) to provide cache-coherent DMA. In these systems it is common for
DMA data to be lost, resulting in broken access to EG20T devices such as
the MMC or SATA controllers.
Support for a DT property to configure the prefetching was added a while
back by commit 549ce8f134bd ("misc: pch\_phub: Read prefetch value from
device tree if passed") but we never added the DT snippet to make use of
it. Add that now in order to disable the prefetching & fix DMA on the
affected systems.

drm/vc4: ->x\_scaling[1] should never be set to VC4\_SCALING\_NONE
[ Upstream commit 0560054da5673b25d56bea6c57c8d069673af73b ]
For the YUV conversion to work properly, ->x\_scaling[1] should never
be set to VC4\_SCALING\_NONE, but vc4\_get\_scaling\_mode() might return
VC4\_SCALING\_NONE if the horizontal scaling ratio exactly matches the
horizontal subsampling factor. Add a test to turn VC4\_SCALING\_NONE
into VC4\_SCALING\_PPF when that happens.
The old ->x\_scaling[0] adjustment is dropped as I couldn't find any
mention to this constraint in the spec and it's proven to be
unnecessary (I tested various multi-planar YUV formats with scaling
disabled, and all of them worked fine without this adjustment).

crypto: aes\_ti - disable interrupts while accessing S-box
[ Upstream commit 0a6a40c2a8c184a2fb467efacfb1cd338d719e0b ]
In the "aes-fixed-time" AES implementation, disable interrupts while
accessing the S-box, in order to make cache-timing attacks more
difficult. Previously it was possible for the CPU to be interrupted
while the S-box was loaded into L1 cache, potentially evicting the
cachelines and causing later table lookups to be time-variant.
In tests I did on x86 and ARM, this doesn't affect performance
significantly. Responsiveness is potentially a concern, but interrupts
are only disabled for a single AES block.
Note that even after this change, the implementation still isn't
necessarily guaranteed to be constant-time; see
https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf for a discussion
of the many difficulties involved in writing truly constant-time AES
software. But it's valuable to make such attacks more difficult.

scsi: lpfc: Fix LOGO/PLOGI handling when triggerd by ABTS Timeout event
[ Upstream commit 30e196cacefdd9a38c857caed23cefc9621bc5c1 ]
After a LOGO in response to an ABTS timeout, a PLOGI wasn't issued to
re-establish the login. An nlp\_type check in the LOGO completion
handler failed to restart discovery for NVME targets. Revised the
nlp\_type check for NVME as well as SCSI.
While reviewing the LOGO handling a few other issues were seen and
were addressed:
- Better lock synchronization around ndlp data types
- When the ABTS times out, unregister the RPI before sending the LOGO
so that all local exchange contexts are cleared and nothing received
while awaiting LOGO/PLOGI handling will be accepted.
- LOGO handling optimized to:
Wait only R\_A\_TOV for a response.
It doesn't need to be retried on timeout. If there wasn't a
response, a PLOGI will be sent, thus an implicit logout
applies as well when the other port sees it.
If there is a response, any kind of response is considered "good"
and the XRI quarantined for a exchange qualifier window.
- PLOGI is issued as soon a LOGO state is resolved.

it should be possible to continue to use the conversion context and queue

genirq/affinity: Spread IRQs to all available NUMA nodes
[ Upstream commit b82592199032bf7c778f861b936287e37ebc9f62 ]
If the number of NUMA nodes exceeds the number of MSI/MSI-X interrupts
which are allocated for a device, the interrupt affinity spreading code
fails to spread them across all nodes.
The reason is, that the spreading code starts from node 0 and continues up
to the number of interrupts requested for allocation. This leaves the nodes
past the last interrupt unused.
This results in interrupt concentration on the first nodes which violates
the assumption of the block layer that all nodes are covered evenly. As a
consequence the NUMA nodes above the number of interrupts are all assigned
to hardware queue 0 and therefore NUMA node 0, which results in bad
performance and has CPU hotplug implications, because queue 0 gets shut
down when the last CPU of node 0 is offlined.
Go over all NUMA nodes and assign them round-robin to all requested
interrupts to solve this.

To be on the safe side: duplicate the string with kstrdup\_const()

pins in the same bank are used as interrupts. The issue doesn't occur
with just a single interrupt pin per bank because the lock is never
contended. I'm experiencing such lockups with GPIO 8 and 28 used as
level-triggered interrupts, i.e. with ->irq\_disable being invoked on
reception of every IRQ.
The critical section protected by the spinlock is very small (one bitop
and one RMW of an MMIO register), hence converting to a raw spinlock
seems a better trade-off than converting the driver to threaded IRQ
handling (which would increase latency to handle an interrupt).

drm/bufs: Fix Spectre v1 vulnerability
[ Upstream commit a37805098900a6e73a55b3a43b7d3bcd987bb3f4 ]
idx can be indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to a
potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.
This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:
drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_bufs.c:1420 drm\_legacy\_freebufs() warn: potential
spectre issue 'dma->buflist' [r] (local cap)
Fix this by sanitizing idx before using it to index dma->buflist
Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].

devres: Align data[] to ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN
commit a66d972465d15b1d89281258805eb8b47d66bd36 upstream.
Initially we bumped into problem with 32-bit aligned atomic64\_t
on ARC, see [1]. And then during quite lengthly discussion Peter Z.
mentioned ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN which IMHO makes perfect sense.
If allocation is done by plain kmalloc() obtained buffer will be
ARCH\_KMALLOC\_MINALIGN aligned and then why buffer obtained via
devm\_kmalloc() should have any other alignment?
This way we at least get the same behavior for both types of
allocation.

nfsd: Fix error return values for nfsd4\_clone\_file\_range()
commit e3fdc89ca47ef34dfb6fd5101fec084c3dba5486 upstream.
If the parameter 'count' is non-zero, nfsd4\_clone\_file\_range() will
currently clobber all errors returned by vfs\_clone\_file\_range() and
replace them with EINVAL.

cacheinfo: Keep the old value if of\_property\_read\_u32 fails
commit 3a34c986324c07dde32903f7bb262e6138e77c2a upstream.
Commit 448a5a552f336bd7b847b1951 ("drivers: base: cacheinfo: use OF
property\_read\_u32 instead of get\_property,read\_number") makes cache
size and number\_of\_sets be 0 if DT doesn't provide there values. I
think this is unreasonable so make them keep the old values, which is
the same as old kernels.

serial: fix race between flush\_to\_ldisc and tty\_open
commit fedb5760648a291e949f2380d383b5b2d2749b5e upstream.
There still is a race window after the commit b027e2298bd588
("tty: fix data race between tty\_init\_dev and flush of buf"),
and we encountered this crash issue if receive\_buf call comes
before tty initialization completes in tty\_open and
tty->driver\_data may be NULL.

it can be fixed by extending ldisc semaphore lock in tty\_init\_dev
to driver\_data initialized completely after tty->ops->open(), but
this will lead to get lock on one function and unlock in some other
function, and hard to maintain, so fix this race only by checking
tty->driver\_data when receiving, and return if tty->driver\_data
is NULL, and n\_tty\_receive\_buf\_common maybe calls uart\_unthrottle,
so add the same check.
Because the tty layer knows nothing about the driver associated with the
device, the tty layer can not do anything here, it is up to the tty
driver itself to check for this type of race. Fix up the serial driver
to correctly check to see if it is finished binding with the device when
being called, and if not, abort the tty calls.

in which this expression is being used.
Fix this by using bitwise AND operator '&' instead.

perf/core: Don't WARN() for impossible ring-buffer sizes
commit 9dff0aa95a324e262ffb03f425d00e4751f3294e upstream.
The perf tool uses /proc/sys/kernel/perf\_event\_mlock\_kb to determine how
large its ringbuffer mmap should be. This can be configured to arbitrary
values, which can be larger than the maximum possible allocation from
kmalloc.
When this is configured to a suitably large value (e.g. thanks to the
perf fuzzer), attempting to use perf record triggers a WARN\_ON\_ONCE() in
\_\_alloc\_pages\_nodemask():
WARNING: CPU: 2 PID: 5666 at mm/page\_alloc.c:4511 \_\_alloc\_pages\_nodemask+0x3f8/0xbc8
Let's avoid this by checking that the requested allocation is possible
before calling kzalloc.

x86/MCE: Initialize mce.bank in the case of a fatal error in mce\_no\_way\_out()
commit d28af26faa0b1daf3c692603d46bc4687c16f19e upstream.
Internal injection testing crashed with a console log that said:
mce: [Hardware Error]: CPU 7: Machine Check Exception: f Bank 0: bd80000000100134
This caused a lot of head scratching because the MCACOD (bits 15:0) of
that status is a signature from an L1 data cache error. But Linux says
that it found it in "Bank 0", which on this model CPU only reports L1
instruction cache errors.
The answer was that Linux doesn't initialize "m->bank" in the case that
it finds a fatal error in the mce\_no\_way\_out() pre-scan of banks. If
this was a local machine check, then this partially initialized struct
mce is being passed to mce\_panic().
Fix is simple: just initialize m->bank in the case of a fatal error.

perf/x86/intel: Delay memory deallocation until x86\_pmu\_dead\_cpu()
commit 602cae04c4864bb3487dfe4c2126c8d9e7e1614a upstream.
intel\_pmu\_cpu\_prepare() allocated memory for ->shared\_regs among other
members of struct cpu\_hw\_events. This memory is released in
intel\_pmu\_cpu\_dying() which is wrong. The counterpart of the
intel\_pmu\_cpu\_prepare() callback is x86\_pmu\_dead\_cpu().
Otherwise if the CPU fails on the UP path between CPUHP\_PERF\_X86\_PREPARE
and CPUHP\_AP\_PERF\_X86\_STARTING then it won't release the memory but
allocate new memory on the next attempt to online the CPU (leaking the
old memory).
Also, if the CPU down path fails between CPUHP\_AP\_PERF\_X86\_STARTING and
CPUHP\_PERF\_X86\_PREPARE then the CPU will go back online but never
allocate the memory that was released in x86\_pmu\_dying\_cpu().
Make the memory allocation/free symmetrical in regard to the CPU hotplug
notifier by moving the deallocation to intel\_pmu\_cpu\_dead().
This started in commit:
a7e3ed1e47011 ("perf: Add support for supplementary event registers").
In principle the bug was introduced in v2.6.39 (!), but it will almost
certainly not backport cleanly across the big CPU hotplug rewrite between v4.7-v4.15...

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Node ID mask

Some PCI uncore PMUs cannot be registered on an 8-socket system (HPE
Superdome Flex).
To understand which Socket the PCI uncore PMUs belongs to, perf retrieves
the local Node ID of the uncore device from CPUNODEID(0xC0) of the PCI
configuration space, and the mapping between Socket ID and Node ID from
GIDNIDMAP(0xD4). The Socket ID can be calculated accordingly.
The local Node ID is only available at bit 2:0, but current code doesn't
mask it. If a BIOS doesn't clear the rest of the bits, an incorrect Node ID
will be fetched.
Filter the Node ID by adding a mask.

cpu/hotplug: Fix "SMT disabled by BIOS" detection for KVM
commit b284909abad48b07d3071a9fc9b5692b3e64914b upstream.
With the following commit:
73d5e2b47264 ("cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS")
... the hotplug code attempted to detect when SMT was disabled by BIOS,
in which case it reported SMT as permanently disabled. However, that
code broke a virt hotplug scenario, where the guest is booted with only
primary CPU threads, and a sibling is brought online later.
The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a way to reliably
distinguish between the HW "SMT disabled by BIOS" case and the virt
"sibling not yet brought online" case. So the above-mentioned commit
was a bit misguided, as it permanently disabled SMT for both cases,
preventing future virt sibling hotplugs.
Going back and reviewing the original problems which were attempted to
be solved by that commit, when SMT was disabled in BIOS:
1) /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control showed "on" instead of
"notsupported"; and
2) vmx\_vm\_init() was incorrectly showing the L1TF\_MSG\_SMT warning.
I'd propose that we instead consider #1 above to not actually be a
problem. Because, at least in the virt case, it's possible that SMT
wasn't disabled by BIOS and a sibling thread could be brought online
later. So it makes sense to just always default the smt control to "on"
to allow for that possibility (assuming cpuid indicates that the CPU
supports SMT).
The real problem is #2, which has a simple fix: change vmx\_vm\_init() to
query the actual current SMT state -- i.e., whether any siblings are
currently online -- instead of looking at the SMT "control" sysfs value.
So fix it by:
a) reverting the original "fix" and its followup fix:
73d5e2b47264 ("cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS")
bc2d8d262cba ("cpu/hotplug: Fix SMT supported evaluation")
and
b) changing vmx\_vm\_init() to query the actual current SMT state --
instead of the sysfs control value -- to determine whether the L1TF
warning is needed. This also requires the 'sched\_smt\_present'
variable to exported, instead of 'cpu\_smt\_control'.

kvm: fix kvm\_ioctl\_create\_device() reference counting (CVE-2019-6974)
commit cfa39381173d5f969daf43582c95ad679189cbc9 upstream.
kvm\_ioctl\_create\_device() does the following:
1. creates a device that holds a reference to the VM object (with a borrowed
reference, the VM's refcount has not been bumped yet)
2. initializes the device
3. transfers the reference to the device to the caller's file descriptor table
4. calls kvm\_get\_kvm() to turn the borrowed reference to the VM into a real
reference
The ownership transfer in step 3 must not happen before the reference to the VM
becomes a proper, non-borrowed reference, which only happens in step 4.
After step 3, an attacker can close the file descriptor and drop the borrowed
reference, which can cause the refcount of the kvm object to drop to zero.
This means that we need to grab a reference for the device before
anon\_inode\_getfd(), otherwise the VM can disappear from under us.

KVM: x86: work around leak of uninitialized stack contents (CVE-2019-7222)

Bugzilla: 1671930
Emulation of certain instructions (VMXON, VMCLEAR, VMPTRLD, VMWRITE with
memory operand, INVEPT, INVVPID) can incorrectly inject a page fault
when passed an operand that points to an MMIO address. The page fault
will use uninitialized kernel stack memory as the CR2 and error code.
The right behavior would be to abort the VM with a KVM\_EXIT\_INTERNAL\_ERROR
exit to userspace; however, it is not an easy fix, so for now just
ensure that the error code and CR2 are zero.

Because the PCI code had recently added a file named 'revision' to every

scsi: cxlflash: Prevent deadlock when adapter probe fails

Presently when an error is encountered during probe of the cxlflash

The deadlock occurs as cxlflash\_remove() is called from cxlflash\_probe()
without setting 'cxlflash\_cfg->state' to STATE\_PROBED and the probe thread
starts to wait on 'cxlflash\_cfg->reset\_waitq'. Since the device was never
successfully probed the 'cxlflash\_cfg->state' never changes from
STATE\_PROBING hence the deadlock occurs.
We fix this deadlock by setting the variable 'cxlflash\_cfg->state' to
STATE\_PROBED in case an error occurs during cxlflash\_probe() and just
before calling cxlflash\_remove().

Commit bf5054569653 ("block: Introduce blk\_revalidate\_disk\_zones()")
inadvertently broke the message output of sd\_zbc\_print\_zones() because the
zone information initialization of the scsi disk structure was moved to the
second scan run while sd\_zbc\_print\_zones() is called on the first
scan. This leads to the following incorrect message to be printed for any
ZBC or ZAC zoned disks.
"...[sdX] 4294967295 zones of 0 logical blocks + 1 runt zone"
Fix this by initializing sdkp zone size and number of zones early on the
first scan. This does not impact the execution of
blk\_revalidate\_zones(). This functions is still called only once the block
device capacity is set on the second revalidate run on boot, or if the disk
zone configuration changed (i.e. the disk changed).

usb: gadget: musb: fix short isoc packets with inventra dma
commit c418fd6c01fbc5516a2cd1eaf1df1ec86869028a upstream.
Handling short packets (length < max packet size) in the Inventra DMA
engine in the MUSB driver causes the MUSB DMA controller to hang. An
example of a problem that is caused by this problem is when streaming
video out of a UVC gadget, only the first video frame is transferred.
For short packets (mode-0 or mode-1 DMA), MUSB\_TXCSR\_TXPKTRDY must be
set manually by the driver. This was previously done in musb\_g\_tx
(musb\_gadget.c), but incorrectly (all csr flags were cleared, and only
MUSB\_TXCSR\_MODE and MUSB\_TXCSR\_TXPKTRDY were set). Fixing that problem
allows some requests to be transferred correctly, but multiple requests
were often put together in one USB packet, and caused problems if the
packet size was not a multiple of 4. Instead, set MUSB\_TXCSR\_TXPKTRDY
in dma\_controller\_irq (musbhsdma.c), just like host mode transfers.
This topic was originally tackled by Nicolas Boichat [0] [1] and is

irqchip/gic-v3-its: Plug allocation race for devices sharing a DevID
commit 9791ec7df0e7b4d80706ccea8f24b6542f6059e9 upstream.
On systems or VMs where multiple devices share a single DevID
(because they sit behind a PCI bridge, or because the HW is
broken in funky ways), we reuse the save its\_device structure
in order to reflect this.
It turns out that there is a distinct lack of locking when looking
up the its\_device, and two device being probed concurrently can result
in double allocations. That's obviously not nice.
A solution for this is to have a per-ITS mutex that serializes device
allocation.
A similar issue exists on the freeing side, which can run concurrently
with the allocation. On top of now taking the appropriate lock, we
also make sure that a shared device is never freed, as we have no way
to currently track the life cycle of such object.

futex: Handle early deadlock return correctly
commit 1a1fb985f2e2b85ec0d3dc2e519ee48389ec2434 upstream.
commit 56222b212e8e ("futex: Drop hb->lock before enqueueing on the
rtmutex") changed the locking rules in the futex code so that the hash
bucket lock is not longer held while the waiter is enqueued into the
rtmutex wait list. This made the lock and the unlock path symmetric, but
unfortunately the possible early exit from \_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() due to
a detected deadlock was not updated accordingly. That allows a concurrent
unlocker to observe inconsitent state which triggers the warning in the
unlock path.
futex\_lock\_pi() futex\_unlock\_pi()
lock(hb->lock)
queue(hb\_waiter) lock(hb->lock)
lock(rtmutex->wait\_lock)
unlock(hb->lock)
// acquired hb->lock
hb\_waiter = futex\_top\_waiter()
lock(rtmutex->wait\_lock)
\_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start()
---> fail
remove(rtmutex\_waiter);
---> returns -EDEADLOCK
unlock(rtmutex->wait\_lock)
// acquired wait\_lock
wake\_futex\_pi()
rt\_mutex\_next\_owner()
--> returns NULL
--> WARN
lock(hb->lock)
unqueue(hb\_waiter)
The problem is caused by the remove(rtmutex\_waiter) in the failure case of
\_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() as this lets the unlocker observe a waiter in the
hash bucket but no waiter on the rtmutex, i.e. inconsistent state.
The original commit handles this correctly for the other early return cases
(timeout, signal) by delaying the removal of the rtmutex waiter until the
returning task reacquired the hash bucket lock.
Treat the failure case of \_\_rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() in the same way and let
the existing cleanup code handle the eventual handover of the rtmutex
gracefully. The regular rt\_mutex\_proxy\_start() gains the rtmutex waiter
removal for the failure case, so that the other callsites are still
operating correctly.
Add proper comments to the code so all these details are fully documented.
Thanks to Peter for helping with the analysis and writing the really
valuable code comments.

dmaengine: imx-dma: fix wrong callback invoke
commit 341198eda723c8c1cddbb006a89ad9e362502ea2 upstream.
Once the "ld\_queue" list is not empty, next descriptor will migrate
into "ld\_active" list. The "desc" variable will be overwritten
during that transition. And later the dmaengine\_desc\_get\_callback\_invoke()
will use it as an argument. As result we invoke wrong callback.
That behaviour was in place since:
commit fcaaba6c7136 ("dmaengine: imx-dma: fix callback path in tasklet").
But after commit 4cd13c21b207 ("softirq: Let ksoftirqd do its job")
things got worse, since possible delay between tasklet\_schedule()
from DMA irq handler and actual tasklet function execution got bigger.
And that gave more time for new DMA request to be submitted and
to be put into "ld\_queue" list.
It has been noticed that DMA issue is causing problems for "mxc-mmc"
driver. While stressing the system with heavy network traffic and
writing/reading to/from sd card simultaneously the timeout may happen:
10013000.sdhci: mxcmci\_watchdog: read time out (status = 0x30004900)
That often lead to file system corruption.

dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix abort of transactions
commit 9e528c799d17a4ac37d788c81440b50377dd592d upstream.
There are multiple issues with bcm2835\_dma\_abort() (which is called on
termination of a transaction):
\* The algorithm to abort the transaction first pauses the channel by
clearing the ACTIVE flag in the CS register, then waits for the PAUSED
flag to clear. Page 49 of the spec documents the latter as follows:
"Indicates if the DMA is currently paused and not transferring data.
This will occur if the active bit has been cleared [...]"
https://www.raspberrypi.org/app/uploads/2012/02/BCM2835-ARM-Peripherals.pdf
So the function is entering an infinite loop because it is waiting for
PAUSED to clear which is always set due to the function having cleared
the ACTIVE flag. The only thing that's saving it from itself is the
upper bound of 10000 loop iterations.
The code comment says that the intention is to "wait for any current
AXI transfer to complete", so the author probably wanted to check the
WAITING\_FOR\_OUTSTANDING\_WRITES flag instead. Amend the function
accordingly.
\* The CS register is only read at the beginning of the function. It
needs to be read again after pausing the channel and before checking
for outstanding writes, otherwise writes which were issued between
the register read at the beginning of the function and pausing the
channel may not be waited for.
\* The function seeks to abort the transfer by writing 0 to the NEXTCONBK
register and setting the ABORT and ACTIVE flags. Thereby, the 0 in
NEXTCONBK is sought to be loaded into the CONBLK\_AD register. However
experimentation has shown this approach to not work: The CONBLK\_AD
register remains the same as before and the CS register contains
0x00000030 (PAUSED | DREQ\_STOPS\_DMA). In other words, the control
block is not aborted but merely paused and it will be resumed once the
next DMA transaction is started. That is absolutely not the desired
behavior.
A simpler approach is to set the channel's RESET flag instead. This
reliably zeroes the NEXTCONBK as well as the CS register. It requires
less code and only a single MMIO write. This is also what popular
user space DMA drivers do, e.g.:
https://github.com/metachris/RPIO/blob/master/source/c\_pwm/pwm.c
Note that the spec is contradictory whether the NEXTCONBK register
is writeable at all. On the one hand, page 41 claims:
"The value loaded into the NEXTCONBK register can be overwritten so
that the linked list of Control Block data structures can be
dynamically altered. However it is only safe to do this when the DMA
is paused."
On the other hand, page 40 specifies:
"Only three registers in each channel's register set are directly
writeable (CS, CONBLK\_AD and DEBUG). The other registers (TI,
SOURCE\_AD, DEST\_AD, TXFR\_LEN, STRIDE & NEXTCONBK), are automatically
loaded from a Control Block data structure held in external memory."

dmaengine: bcm2835: Fix interrupt race on RT
commit f7da7782aba92593f7b82f03d2409a1c5f4db91b upstream.
If IRQ handlers are threaded (either because CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_RT\_BASE is
enabled or "threadirqs" was passed on the command line) and if system
load is sufficiently high that wakeup latency of IRQ threads degrades,
SPI DMA transactions on the BCM2835 occasionally break like this:
ks8851 spi0.0: SPI transfer timed out
bcm2835-dma 3f007000.dma: DMA transfer could not be terminated
ks8851 spi0.0 eth2: ks8851\_rdfifo: spi\_sync() failed
The root cause is an assumption made by the DMA driver which is
documented in a code comment in bcm2835\_dma\_terminate\_all():
/\*
\* Stop DMA activity: we assume the callback will not be called
\* after bcm\_dma\_abort() returns (even if it does, it will see
\* c->desc is NULL and exit.)
\*/
That assumption falls apart if the IRQ handler bcm2835\_dma\_callback() is
threaded: A client may terminate a descriptor and issue a new one
before the IRQ handler had a chance to run. In fact the IRQ handler may
miss an \*arbitrary\* number of descriptors. The result is the following
race condition:
1. A descriptor finishes, its interrupt is deferred to the IRQ thread.
2. A client calls dma\_terminate\_async() which sets channel->desc = NULL.
3. The client issues a new descriptor. Because channel->desc is NULL,
bcm2835\_dma\_issue\_pending() immediately starts the descriptor.
4. Finally the IRQ thread runs and writes BCM2835\_DMA\_INT to the CS
register to acknowledge the interrupt. This clears the ACTIVE flag,
so the newly issued descriptor is paused in the middle of the
transaction. Because channel->desc is not NULL, the IRQ thread
finalizes the descriptor and tries to start the next one.
I see two possible solutions: The first is to call synchronize\_irq()
in bcm2835\_dma\_issue\_pending() to wait until the IRQ thread has
finished before issuing a new descriptor. The downside of this approach
is unnecessary latency if clients desire rapidly terminating and
re-issuing descriptors and don't have any use for an IRQ callback.
(The SPI TX DMA channel is a case in point.)
A better alternative is to make the IRQ thread recognize that it has
missed descriptors and avoid finalizing the newly issued descriptor.
So first of all, set the ACTIVE flag when acknowledging the interrupt.
This keeps a newly issued descriptor running.
If the descriptor was finished, the channel remains idle despite the
ACTIVE flag being set. However the ACTIVE flag can then no longer be
used to check whether the channel is idle, so instead check whether
the register containing the current control block address is zero
and finalize the current descriptor only if so.
That way, there is no impact on latency and throughput if the client
doesn't care for the interrupt: Only minimal additional overhead is
introduced for non-cyclic descriptors as one further MMIO read is
necessary per interrupt to check for idleness of the channel. Cyclic
descriptors are sped up slightly by removing one MMIO write per
interrupt.

It is normal user behaviour to start, stop, then start a stream
again without closing it. Currently this works for compressed
playback streams but not capture ones.
The states on a compressed capture stream go directly from OPEN to
PREPARED, unlike a playback stream which moves to SETUP and waits
for a write of data before moving to PREPARED. Currently however,
when a stop is sent the state is set to SETUP for both types of
streams. This leaves a capture stream in the situation where a new
start can't be sent as that requires the state to be PREPARED and
a new set\_params can't be sent as that requires the state to be
OPEN. The only option being to close the stream, and then reopen.
Correct this issues by allowing snd\_compr\_drain\_notify to set the
state depending on the stream direction, as we already do in
set\_params.

xfs: eof trim writeback mapping as soon as it is cached
commit aa6ee4ab69293969867ab09b57546d226ace3d7a upstream.
The cached writeback mapping is EOF trimmed to try and avoid races
between post-eof block management and writeback that result in
sending cached data to a stale location. The cached mapping is
currently trimmed on the validation check, which leaves a race
window between the time the mapping is cached and when it is trimmed
against the current inode size.
For example, if a new mapping is cached by delalloc conversion on a
blocksize == page size fs, we could cycle various locks, perform
memory allocations, etc. in the writeback codepath before the
associated mapping is eventually trimmed to i\_size. This leaves
enough time for a post-eof truncate and file append before the
cached mapping is trimmed. The former event essentially invalidates
a range of the cached mapping and the latter bumps the inode size
such the trim on the next writepage event won't trim all of the
invalid blocks. fstest generic/464 reproduces this scenario
occasionally and causes a lost writeback and stale delalloc blocks
warning on inode inactivation.
To work around this problem, trim the cached writeback mapping as
soon as it is cached in addition to on subsequent validation checks.
This is a minor tweak to tighten the race window as much as possible
until a proper invalidation mechanism is available.

net/mlx5e: Force CHECKSUM\_UNNECESSARY for short ethernet frames
[ Upstream commit e8c8b53ccaff568fef4c13a6ccaf08bf241aa01a ]
When an ethernet frame is padded to meet the minimum ethernet frame
size, the padding octets are not covered by the hardware checksum.
Fortunately the padding octets are usually zero's, which don't affect
checksum. However, we have a switch which pads non-zero octets, this
causes kernel hardware checksum fault repeatedly.
Prior to:
commit '88078d98d1bb ("net: pskb\_trim\_rcsum() and CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE ...")'
skb checksum was forced to be CHECKSUM\_NONE when padding is detected.
After it, we need to keep skb->csum updated, like what we do for RXFCS.
However, fixing up CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE requires to verify and parse IP
headers, it is not worthy the effort as the packets are so small that
CHECKSUM\_COMPLETE can't save anything.

net: cls\_flower: Remove filter from mask before freeing it
[ Upstream commit c1f7e02979edd7a3a3e69fe04be60b1d650dc8a7 ]
In fl\_change(), when adding a new rule (i.e. fold == NULL), a driver may
reject the new rule, for example due to resource exhaustion. By that
point, the new rule was already assigned a mask, and it was added to
that mask's hash table. The clean-up path that's invoked as a result of
the rejection however neglects to undo the hash table addition, and
proceeds to free the new rule, thus leaving a dangling pointer in the
hash table.
Fix by removing fnew from the mask's hash table before it is freed.

Broadcom STB chips support a deep sleep mode where all register

into some of these registers a suspend into that deep sleep then a
resumption would not lead to being able to wake-up from MagicPacket with
password again.
Fix this by keeping a software copy of the password and program it

net: dsa: slave: Don't propagate flag changes on down slave interfaces
[ Upstream commit 17ab4f61b8cd6f9c38e9d0b935d86d73b5d0d2b5 ]
The unbalance of master's promiscuity or allmulti will happen after ifdown
and ifup a slave interface which is in a bridge.
When we ifdown a slave interface , both the 'dsa\_slave\_close' and
'dsa\_slave\_change\_rx\_flags' will clear the master's flags. The flags
of master will be decrease twice.
In the other hand, if we ifup the slave interface again, since the
slave's flags were cleared the 'dsa\_slave\_open' won't set the master's
flag, only 'dsa\_slave\_change\_rx\_flags' that triggered by 'br\_add\_if'
will set the master's flags. The flags of master is increase once.
Only propagating flag changes when a slave interface is up makes
sure this does not happen. The 'vlan\_dev\_change\_rx\_flags' had the
same problem and was fixed, and changes here follows that fix.

net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Fix counting of ATU violations
[ Upstream commit 75c05a74e745ae7d663b04d75777af80ada2233c ]
The ATU port vector contains a bit per port of the switch. The code
wrongly used it as a port number, and incremented a port counter. This
resulted in the wrong interfaces counter being incremented, and
potentially going off the end of the array of ports.
Fix this by using the source port ID for the violation, which really
is a port number.

net: dp83640: expire old TX-skb
[ Upstream commit 53bc8d2af08654659abfadfd3e98eb9922ff787c ]
During sendmsg() a cloned skb is saved via dp83640\_txtstamp() in
->tx\_queue. After the NIC sends this packet, the PHY will reply with a
timestamp for that TX packet. If the cable is pulled at the right time I
don't see that packet. It might gets flushed as part of queue shutdown
on NIC's side.
Once the link is up again then after the next sendmsg() we enqueue
another skb in dp83640\_txtstamp() and have two on the list. Then the PHY
will send a reply and decode\_txts() attaches it to the first skb on the
list.
No crash occurs since refcounting works but we are one packet behind.
linuxptp/ptp4l usually closes the socket and opens a new one (in such a
timeout case) so those "stale" replies never get there. However it does
not resume normal operation anymore.
Purge old skbs in decode\_txts().

xprtrdma: Don't wake pending tasks until disconnect is done
[ Upstream commit 0c0829bcf51aef713806e49b8ea2bac7962f54e2 ]
Transport disconnect processing does a "wake pending tasks" at
various points.
Suppose an RPC Reply is being processed. The RPC task that Reply
goes with is waiting on the pending queue. If a disconnect wake-up
happens before reply processing is done, that reply, even if it is
good, is thrown away, and the RPC has to be sent again.
This window apparently does not exist for socket transports because
there is a lock held while a reply is being received which prevents
the wake-up call until after reply processing is done.
To resolve this, all RPC replies being processed on an RPC-over-RDMA
transport have to complete before pending tasks are awoken due to a
transport disconnect.
Callers that already hold the transport write lock may invoke
->ops->close directly. Others use a generic helper that schedules
a close when the write lock can be taken safely.

scripts/gdb: fix lx-version string output
[ Upstream commit b058809bfc8faeb7b7cae047666e23375a060059 ]
A bug is present in GDB which causes early string termination when
parsing variables. This has been reported [0], but we should ensure
that we can support at least basic printing of the core kernel strings.
For current gdb version (has been tested with 7.3 and 8.1), 'lx-version'
only prints one character.
(gdb) lx-version
L(gdb)
This can be fixed by casting 'linux\_banner' as (char \*).

kernel/kcov.c: mark write\_comp\_data() as notrace
[ Upstream commit 634724431607f6f46c495dfef801a1c8b44a96d9 ]
Since \_\_sanitizer\_cov\_trace\_const\_cmp4 is marked as notrace, the
function called from \_\_sanitizer\_cov\_trace\_const\_cmp4 shouldn't be
traceable either. ftrace\_graph\_caller() gets called every time func
write\_comp\_data() gets called if it isn't marked 'notrace'. This is the
backtrace from gdb:
#0 ftrace\_graph\_caller () at ../arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:179
#1 0xffffff8010201920 in ftrace\_caller () at ../arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:151

#5 0xffffff801020194c in ftrace\_graph\_caller () at ../arch/arm64/kernel/entry-ftrace.S:182
Rework so that write\_comp\_data() that are called from
\_\_sanitizer\_cov\_trace\_\*\_cmp\*() are marked as 'notrace'.
Commit 903e8ff86753 ("kernel/kcov.c: mark funcs in \_\_sanitizer\_cov\_trace\_pc() as notrace")
missed to mark write\_comp\_data() as 'notrace'. When that patch was
created gcc-7 was used. In lib/Kconfig.debug
config KCOV\_ENABLE\_COMPARISONS
depends on $(cc-option,-fsanitize-coverage=trace-cmp)
That code path isn't hit with gcc-7. However, it were that with gcc-8.

exec: load\_script: don't blindly truncate shebang string
[ Upstream commit 8099b047ecc431518b9bb6bdbba3549bbecdc343 ]
load\_script() simply truncates bprm->buf and this is very wrong if the
length of shebang string exceeds BINPRM\_BUF\_SIZE-2. This can silently
truncate i\_arg or (worse) we can execute the wrong binary if buf[2:126]
happens to be the valid executable path.
Change load\_script() to return ENOEXEC if it can't find '\n' or zero in
bprm->buf. Note that '\0' can come from either
prepare\_binprm()->memset() or from kernel\_read(), we do not care.

fs/epoll: drop ovflist branch prediction
[ Upstream commit 76699a67f3041ff4c7af6d6ee9be2bfbf1ffb671 ]
The ep->ovflist is a secondary ready-list to temporarily store events
that might occur when doing sproc without holding the ep->wq.lock. This
accounts for every time we check for ready events and also send events
back to userspace; both callbacks, particularly the latter because of
copy\_to\_user, can account for a non-trivial time.
As such, the unlikely() check to see if the pointer is being used, seems
both misleading and sub-optimal. In fact, we go to an awful lot of
trouble to sync both lists, and populating the ovflist is far from an
uncommon scenario.
For example, profiling a concurrent epoll\_wait(2) benchmark, with
CONFIG\_PROFILE\_ANNOTATED\_BRANCHES shows that for a two threads a 33%
incorrect rate was seen; and when incrementally increasing the number of
epoll instances (which is used, for example for multiple queuing load
balancing models), up to a 90% incorrect rate was seen.
Similarly, by deleting the prediction, 3% throughput boost was seen
across incremental threads.

kernel/hung\_task.c: force console verbose before panic
[ Upstream commit 168e06f7937d96c7222037d8a05565e8a6eb00fe ]
Based on commit 401c636a0eeb ("kernel/hung\_task.c: show all hung tasks
before panic"), we could get the call stack of hung task.
However, if the console loglevel is not high, we still can not see the
useful panic information in practice, and in most cases users don't set
console loglevel to high level.
This patch is to force console verbose before system panic, so that the
real useful information can be seen in the console, instead of being
like the following, which doesn't have hung task information.

proc/sysctl: fix return error for proc\_doulongvec\_minmax()
[ Upstream commit 09be178400829dddc1189b50a7888495dd26aa84 ]
If the number of input parameters is less than the total parameters, an
EINVAL error will be returned.
For example, we use proc\_doulongvec\_minmax to pass up to two parameters
with kern\_table:
{
.procname = "monitor\_signals",
.data = &monitor\_sigs,
.maxlen = 2\*sizeof(unsigned long),
.mode = 0644,
.proc\_handler = proc\_doulongvec\_minmax,
},
Reproduce:
When passing two parameters, it's work normal. But passing only one
parameter, an error "Invalid argument"(EINVAL) is returned.
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 1 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
1 2
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
[root@cl150 ~]# echo $?
1
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
3 2
[root@cl150 ~]#
The following is the result after apply this patch. No error is
returned when the number of input parameters is less than the total
parameters.
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 1 2 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
1 2
[root@cl150 ~]# echo 3 > /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
[root@cl150 ~]# echo $?
0
[root@cl150 ~]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/monitor\_signals
3 2
[root@cl150 ~]#
There are three processing functions dealing with digital parameters,
\_\_do\_proc\_dointvec/\_\_do\_proc\_douintvec/\_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax.
This patch deals with \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax, just as
\_\_do\_proc\_dointvec does, adding a check for parameters 'left'. In
\_\_do\_proc\_douintvec, its code implementation explicitly does not support
multiple inputs.
static int \_\_do\_proc\_douintvec(...){
...
/\*
\* Arrays are not supported, keep this simple. \*Do not\* add
\* support for them.
\*/
if (vleft != 1) {
\*lenp = 0;
return -EINVAL;
}
...
}
So, just \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax has the problem. And most use of
proc\_doulongvec\_minmax/proc\_doulongvec\_ms\_jiffies\_minmax just have one
parameter.

kernel/hung\_task.c: break RCU locks based on jiffies
[ Upstream commit 304ae42739b108305f8d7b3eb3c1aec7c2b643a9 ]
check\_hung\_uninterruptible\_tasks() is currently calling rcu\_lock\_break()
for every 1024 threads. But check\_hung\_task() is very slow if printk()
was called, and is very fast otherwise.
If many threads within some 1024 threads called printk(), the RCU grace
period might be extended enough to trigger RCU stall warnings.
Therefore, calling rcu\_lock\_break() for every some fixed jiffies will be
safer.

arm64/sve: ptrace: Fix SVE\_PT\_REGS\_OFFSET definition
[ Upstream commit ee1b465b303591d3a04d403122bbc0d7026520fb ]
SVE\_PT\_REGS\_OFFSET is supposed to indicate the offset for skipping
over the ptrace NT\_ARM\_SVE header (struct user\_sve\_header) to the
start of the SVE register data proper.
However, currently SVE\_PT\_REGS\_OFFSET is defined in terms of struct
sve\_context, which is wrong: that structure describes the SVE
header in the signal frame, not in the ptrace regset.
This patch fixes the definition to use the ptrace header structure
struct user\_sve\_header instead.
By good fortune, the two structures are the same size anyway, so
there is no functional or ABI change.

thermal: generic-adc: Fix adc to temp interpolation
[ Upstream commit 9d216211fded20fff301d0317af3238d8383634c ]
First correct the edge case to return the last element if we're
outside the range, rather than at the last element, so that
interpolation is not omitted for points between the two last entries in
the table.
Then correct the formula to perform linear interpolation based the two
points surrounding the read ADC value. The indices for temp are kept as
"hi" and "lo" to pair with the adc indices, but there's no requirement
that the temperature is provided in descendent order. mult\_frac() is
used to prevent issues with overflowing the int.

Reverting commit 8ccb8cb1892b ("swim3: convert to blk-mq") resolves the
problem.
That commit added a struct blk\_mq\_tag\_set to struct floppy\_state and
initialized it with a blk\_mq\_init\_sq\_queue() call. Unfortunately, there
is a memset() in swim3\_add\_device() that subsequently clears the
floppy\_state struct. That means fs->tag\_set->ops is a NULL pointer, and
it gets dereferenced by blk\_mq\_free\_rqs() which gets called in the
request\_irq() error path. Move the memset() to fix this bug.
BTW, the request\_irq() failure for the left mediabay floppy (fd1) is not
a regression. I don't know why it happens. The right media bay floppy
(fd0) works fine however.

PCI: imx: Enable MSI from downstream components
[ Upstream commit 75cb8d20c112aba70f23d98e3f8d0a38ace16006 ]
The MSI Enable bit in the MSI Capability (PCIe r4.0, sec 7.7.1.2) controls
whether a Function can request service using MSI.
i.MX6 Root Ports implement the MSI Capability and may use MSI to request
service for events like PME, hotplug, AER, etc. In addition, on i.MX6, the
MSI Enable bit controls delivery of MSI interrupts from components below
the Root Port.
Prior to f3fdfc4ac3a2 ("PCI: Remove host driver Kconfig selection of
CONFIG\_PCIEPORTBUS"), enabling CONFIG\_PCI\_IMX6 automatically also enabled
CONFIG\_PCIEPORTBUS, and when portdrv claimed the Root Ports, it set the MSI
Enable bit so it could use PME, hotplug, AER, etc. As a side effect, that
also enabled delivery of MSI interrupts from downstream components.
The imx6q-pcie driver itself does not depend on portdrv, so set MSI Enable
in imx6q-pcie so MSI from downstream components works even if nobody uses
MSI for the Root Port events.

thermal: tsens: qcom: do not create duplicate regmap debugfs entries
[ Upstream commit 4ab248b3b10a58e379e2d32333fff99ea5ca256c ]
Regmap would use device name to create debugfs entries. If the device
has multiple regmaps it is recommended to use name field in regmap\_config.
Fix this by providing name to the regmap configs correctly.
Without this patch we would see below error on DB820c.

kdb: Don't back trace on a cpu that didn't round up
[ Upstream commit 162bc7f5afd75b72acbe3c5f3488ef7e64a3fe36 ]
If you have a CPU that fails to round up and then run 'btc' you'll end
up crashing in kdb becaue we dereferenced NULL. Let's add a check.
It's wise to also set the task to NULL when leaving the debugger so
that if we fail to round up on a later entry into the debugger we
won't backtrace a stale task.

When the block device is opened with FMODE\_EXCL, ref\_count is set to -1.
This value doesn't get reset when the device is closed which means the
device cannot be opened again. Fix this by checking for refcount <= 0
in the release method.

gdrom: fix a memory leak bug
[ Upstream commit 093c48213ee37c3c3ff1cf5ac1aa2a9d8bc66017 ]
In probe\_gdrom(), the buffer pointed by 'gd.cd\_info' is allocated through
kzalloc() and is used to hold the information of the gdrom device. To
register and unregister the device, the pointer 'gd.cd\_info' is passed to
the functions register\_cdrom() and unregister\_cdrom(), respectively.
However, this buffer is not freed after it is used, which can cause a
memory leak bug.
This patch simply frees the buffer 'gd.cd\_info' in exit\_gdrom() to fix the
above issue.

zram: fix lockdep warning of free block handling

Patch series "zram idle page writeback", v3.
Inherently, swap device has many idle pages which are rare touched since
it was allocated. It is never problem if we use storage device as swap.
However, it's just waste for zram-swap.
This patchset supports zram idle page writeback feature.
\* Admin can define what is idle page "no access since X time ago"
\* Admin can define when zram should writeback them
\* Admin can define when zram should stop writeback to prevent wearout

With writeback feature, zram\_slot\_free\_notify could be called in softirq
context by end\_swap\_bio\_read. However, bitmap\_lock is not aware of that
so lockdep yell out:
get\_entry\_bdev
spin\_lock(bitmap->lock);
irq
softirq
end\_swap\_bio\_read
zram\_slot\_free\_notify
zram\_slot\_lock <-- deadlock prone
zram\_free\_page
put\_entry\_bdev
spin\_lock(bitmap->lock); <-- deadlock prone
With akpm's suggestion (i.e. bitmap operation is already atomic), we
could remove bitmap lock. It might fail to find a empty slot if serious
contention happens. However, it's not severe problem because huge page
writeback has already possiblity to fail if there is severe memory
pressure. Worst case is just keeping the incompressible in memory, not
storage.
The other problem is zram\_slot\_lock in zram\_slot\_slot\_free\_notify. To
make it safe is this patch introduces zram\_slot\_trylock where
zram\_slot\_free\_notify uses it. Although it's rare to be contented, this
patch adds new debug stat "miss\_free" to keep monitoring how often it
happens.

mm/page\_alloc.c: don't call kasan\_free\_pages() at deferred mem init
[ Upstream commit 3c0c12cc8f00ca5f81acb010023b8eb13e9a7004 ]
When CONFIG\_KASAN is enabled on large memory SMP systems, the deferrred
pages initialization can take a long time. Below were the reported init
times on a 8-socket 96-core 4TB IvyBridge system.
1) Non-debug kernel without CONFIG\_KASAN
[ 8.764222] node 1 initialised, 132086516 pages in 7027ms
2) Debug kernel with CONFIG\_KASAN
[ 146.288115] node 1 initialised, 132075466 pages in 143052ms
So the page init time in a debug kernel was 20X of the non-debug kernel.
The long init time can be problematic as the page initialization is done
with interrupt disabled. In this particular case, it caused the
appearance of following warning messages as well as NMI backtraces of all
the cores that were doing the initialization.
[ 68.240049] rcu: INFO: rcu\_sched detected stalls on CPUs/tasks:

[ 68.241000] rcu: (detected by 13, t=65018 jiffies, g=249, q=2)
The long init time was mainly caused by the call to kasan\_free\_pages() to
poison the newly initialized pages. On a 4TB system, we are talking about
almost 500GB of memory probably on the same node.
In reality, we may not need to poison the newly initialized pages before
they are ever allocated. So KASAN poisoning of freed pages before the
completion of deferred memory initialization is now disabled. Those pages
will be properly poisoned when they are allocated or freed after deferred
pages initialization is done.
With this change, the new page initialization time became:
[ 21.948010] node 1 initialised, 132075466 pages in 18702ms
This was still about double the non-debug kernel time, but was much
better than before.

ocfs2: improve ocfs2 Makefile
[ Upstream commit 9e6aea22802b5684c7e1d69822aeb0844dd01953 ]
Included file path was hard-wired in the ocfs2 makefile, which might
causes some confusion when compiling ocfs2 as an external module.
Say if we compile ocfs2 module as following.
cp -r /kernel/tree/fs/ocfs2 /other/dir/ocfs2
cd /other/dir/ocfs2
make -C /path/to/kernel\_source M=`pwd` modules
Acutally, the compiler wil try to find included file in
/kernel/tree/fs/ocfs2, rather than the directory /other/dir/ocfs2.
To fix this little bug, we introduce the var $(src) provided by kbuild.
$(src) means the absolute path of the running kbuild file.

ocfs2: don't clear bh uptodate for block read
[ Upstream commit 70306d9dce75abde855cefaf32b3f71eed8602a3 ]
For sync io read in ocfs2\_read\_blocks\_sync(), first clear bh uptodate flag
and submit the io, second wait io done, last check whether bh uptodate, if
not return io error.
If two sync io for the same bh were issued, it could be the first io done
and set uptodate flag, but just before check that flag, the second io came
in and cleared uptodate, then ocfs2\_read\_blocks\_sync() for the first io
will return IO error.
Indeed it's not necessary to clear uptodate flag, as the io end handler
end\_buffer\_read\_sync() will set or clear it based on io succeed or failed.
The following message was found from a nfs server but the underlying
storage returned no error.

scripts/decode\_stacktrace: only strip base path when a prefix of the path
[ Upstream commit 67a28de47faa83585dd644bd4c31e5a1d9346c50 ]
Running something like:
decodecode vmlinux .
leads to interested results where not only the leading "." gets stripped
from the displayed paths, but also anywhere in the string, displaying
something like:
kvm\_vcpu\_check\_block (arch/arm64/kvm/virt/kvm/kvm\_mainc:2141)
which doesn't help further processing.
Fix it by only stripping the base path if it is a prefix of the path.

perf python: Do not force closing original perf descriptor in evlist.get\_pollfd()
[ Upstream commit a389aece97938966616ce0336466b98b0351ef10 ]
Ondřej reported that when compiled with python3, the python extension
regresses in evlist.get\_pollfd function behaviour.
The evlist.get\_pollfd function creates file objects from evlist's fds
and returns them in a list. The python3 version also sets them to 'close
the original descriptor' when the object dies (is closed), by passing
True via the 'closefd' arg in the PyFile\_FromFd call.
The python's closefd doc says:
If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
when the file is closed.
That's why the following line in python3 closes all evlist fds:
evlist.get\_pollfd()
the returned list is immediately destroyed and that takes down the
original events fds.
Passing closefd as False to PyFile\_FromFd to fix this.

There is an issue where when multiple threads open/close the same directory

MIPS: ralink: Select CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI on MT7620/8
[ Upstream commit 0b15394475e3bcaf35ca4bf22fc55d56df67224e ]
Testing has shown, that when using mainline U-Boot on MT7688 based
boards, the system may hang or crash while mounting the root-fs. The
main issue here is that mainline U-Boot configures EBase to a value
near the end of system memory. And with CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI
disabled, trap\_init() will not allocate a new area to place the
exception handler. The original value will be used and the handler
will be copied to this location, which might already be used by some
userspace application.
The MT7688 supports VI - its config3 register is 0x00002420, so VInt
(Bit 5) is set. But without setting CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI this
bit will not be evaluated to result in "cpu\_has\_vi" being set. This
patch now selects CONFIG\_CPU\_MIPSR2\_IRQ\_VI on MT7620/8 which results
trap\_init() to allocate some memory for the exception handler.
Please note that this issue was not seen with the Mediatek U-Boot
version, as it does not touch EBase (stays at default of 0x8000.0000).
This is strictly also not correct as the kernel (\_text) resides
here.

seq\_buf: Make seq\_buf\_puts() null-terminate the buffer
[ Upstream commit 0464ed24380905d640030d368cd84a4e4d1e15e2 ]
Currently seq\_buf\_puts() will happily create a non null-terminated
string for you in the buffer. This is particularly dangerous if the
buffer is on the stack.
For example:
char buf[8];
char secret = "secret";
struct seq\_buf s;
seq\_buf\_init(&s, buf, sizeof(buf));
seq\_buf\_puts(&s, "foo");
printk("Message is %s\n", buf);
Can result in:
Message is fooªªªªªsecret
We could require all users to memset() their buffer to zero before
use. But that seems likely to be forgotten and lead to bugs.
Instead we can change seq\_buf\_puts() to always leave the buffer in a
null-terminated state.
The only downside is that this makes the buffer 1 character smaller
for seq\_buf\_puts(), but that seems like a good trade off.

perf build: Don't unconditionally link the libbfd feature test to -liberty and -lz
[ Upstream commit 14541b1e7e723859ff2c75c6fc10cdbbec6b8c34 ]
Current libbfd feature test unconditionally links against -liberty and -lz.
While it's required on some systems (e.g. opensuse), it's completely
unnecessary on the others, where only -lbdf is sufficient (debian).
This patch streamlines (and renames) the following feature checks:
feature-libbfd - only link against -lbfd (debian),
see commit 2cf9040714f3 ("perf tools: Fix bfd
dependency libraries detection")
feature-libbfd-liberty - link against -lbfd and -liberty
feature-libbfd-liberty-z - link against -lbfd, -liberty and -lz (opensuse),
see commit 280e7c48c3b8 ("perf tools: fix BFD
detection on opensuse")
(feature-liberty{,-z} were renamed to feature-libbfd-liberty{,z}
for clarity)
The main motivation is to fix this feature test for bpftool which is
currently broken on debian (libbfd feature shows OFF, but we still
unconditionally link against -lbfd and it works).
Tested on debian with only -lbfd installed (without -liberty); I'd
appreciate if somebody on the other systems can test this new detection
method.

NFS: nfs\_compare\_mount\_options always compare auth flavors.
[ Upstream commit 594d1644cd59447f4fceb592448d5cd09eb09b5e ]
This patch removes the check from nfs\_compare\_mount\_options to see if a
`sec' option was passed for the current mount before comparing auth
flavors and instead just always compares auth flavors.
Consider the following scenario:
You have a server with the address 192.168.1.1 and two exports /export/a
and /export/b. The first export supports `sys' and `krb5' security, the
second just `sys'.
Assume you start with no mounts from the server.
The following results in EIOs being returned as the kernel nfs client
incorrectly thinks it can share the underlying `struct nfs\_server's:
$ mkdir /tmp/{a,b}
$ sudo mount -t nfs -o vers=3,sec=krb5 192.168.1.1:/export/a /tmp/a

powerpc/fadump: Do not allow hot-remove memory from fadump reserved area.
[ Upstream commit 0db6896ff6332ba694f1e61b93ae3b2640317633 ]
For fadump to work successfully there should not be any holes in reserved
memory ranges where kernel has asked firmware to move the content of old
kernel memory in event of crash. Now that fadump uses CMA for reserved
area, this memory area is now not protected from hot-remove operations
unless it is cma allocated. Hence, fadump service can fail to re-register
after the hot-remove operation, if hot-removed memory belongs to fadump
reserved region. To avoid this make sure that memory from fadump reserved
area is not hot-removable if fadump is registered.
However, if user still wants to remove that memory, he can do so by
manually stopping fadump service before hot-remove operation.

pinctrl: meson: meson8: fix the GPIO function for the GPIOAO pins
[ Upstream commit 42f9b48cc5402be11d2364275eb18c257d2a79e8 ]
The GPIOAO pins (as well as the two exotic GPIO\_BSD\_EN and GPIO\_TEST\_N)
only belong to the pin controller in the AO domain. With the current
definition these pins cannot be referred to in .dts files as group
(which is possible on GXBB and GXL for example).
Add a separate "gpio\_aobus" function to fix the mapping between the pin
controller and the GPIO pins in the AO domain. This is similar to how
the GXBB and GXL drivers implement this functionality.

bpf: sk\_msg, fix socket data\_ready events
[ Upstream commit 552de91068828daef50a227a665068cf8dde835e ]
When a skb verdict program is in-use and either another BPF program
redirects to that socket or the new SK\_PASS support is used the
data\_ready callback does not wake up application. Instead because
the stream parser/verdict is using the sk data\_ready callback we wake
up the stream parser/verdict block.
Fix this by adding a helper to check if the stream parser block is
enabled on the sk and if so call the saved pointer which is the
upper layers wake up function.
This fixes application stalls observed when an application is waiting
for data in a blocking read().

fbdev: fbcon: Fix unregister crash when more than one framebuffer
[ Upstream commit 2122b40580dd9d0620398739c773d07a7b7939d0 ]
When unregistering fbdev using unregister\_framebuffer(), any bound
console will unbind automatically. This is working fine if this is the
only framebuffer, resulting in a switch to the dummy console. However if
there is a fb0 and I unregister fb1 having a bound console, I eventually
get a crash. The fastest way for me to trigger the crash is to do a
reboot, resulting in this splat:

igb: Fix an issue that PME is not enabled during runtime suspend
[ Upstream commit 1fb3a7a75e2efcc83ef21f2434069cddd6fae6f5 ]
I210 ethernet card doesn't wakeup when a cable gets plugged. It's
because its PME is not set.
Since commit 42eca2302146 ("PCI: Don't touch card regs after runtime
suspend D3"), if the PCI state is saved, pci\_pm\_runtime\_suspend() stops
calling pci\_finish\_runtime\_suspend(), which enables the PCI PME.
To fix the issue, let's not to save PCI states when it's runtime
suspend, to let the PCI subsystem enables PME.

fbdev: fbmem: behave better with small rotated displays and many CPUs
[ Upstream commit f75df8d4b4fabfad7e3cba2debfad12741c6fde7 ]
Blitting an image with "negative" offsets is not working since there
is no clipping. It hopefully just crashes. For the bootup logo, there
is protection so that blitting does not happen as the image is drawn
further and further to the right (ROTATE\_UR) or further and further
down (ROTATE\_CW). There is however no protection when drawing in the
opposite directions (ROTATE\_UD and ROTATE\_CCW).
Add back this protection.
The regression is 20-odd years old but the mindless warning-killing
mentality displayed in commit 34bdb666f4b2 ("fbdev: fbmem: remove
positive test on unsigned values") is also to blame, methinks.

So resync io is waiting for regular write io to complete to
decrease nr\_pending (conf->barrier++ is called before waiting).
The regular write io splits another bio after call wait\_barrier
which call nr\_pending++, then the splitted bio would continue
with raid10\_write\_request -> wait\_barrier, so the splitted bio
has to wait for barrier to be zero, then deadlock happens as
follows.
resync io regular io
raise\_barrier
wait\_barrier
generic\_make\_request
wait\_barrier
To resolve the issue, we need to call allow\_barrier to decrease
nr\_pending before generic\_make\_request since regular IO is not
issued to underlying devices, and wait\_barrier is called again
to ensure no internal IO happening.

2. Meanwhile ath10k receive HTT\_T2H\_MSG\_TYPE\_PEER\_STATS message.
In ath10k\_htt\_fetch\_peer\_stats(), arsta->tx\_stats get accessed after
the peer validation check.
Since arsta->tx\_stats get freed before the peer deletion [1].
ath10k\_htt\_fetch\_peer\_stats() ended up in "use after free" situation.
Fixed this issue by moving the arsta->tx\_stats free handling after the
peer deletion. so that ath10k\_htt\_fetch\_peer\_stats() will not end up in
"use after free" situation.

drbd: skip spurious timeout (ping-timeo) when failing promote
[ Upstream commit 9848b6ddd8c92305252f94592c5e278574e7a6ac ]
If you try to promote a Secondary while connected to a Primary
and allow-two-primaries is NOT set, we will wait for "ping-timeout"
to give this node a chance to detect a dead primary,
in case the cluster manager noticed faster than we did.
But if we then are \*still\* connected to a Primary,
we fail (after an additional timeout of ping-timout).
This change skips the spurious second timeout.
Most people won't notice really,
since "ping-timeout" by default is half a second.
But in some installations, ping-timeout may be 10 or 20 seconds or more,
and spuriously delaying the error return becomes annoying.

drbd: disconnect, if the wrong UUIDs are attached on a connected peer
[ Upstream commit b17b59602b6dcf8f97a7dc7bc489a48388d7063a ]
With "on-no-data-accessible suspend-io", DRBD requires the next attach
or connect to be to the very same data generation uuid tag it lost last.
If we first lost connection to the peer,
then later lost connection to our own disk,
we would usually refuse to re-connect to the peer,
because it presents the wrong data set.
However, if the peer first connects without a disk,
and then attached its disk, we accepted that same wrong data set,
which would be "unexpected" by any user of that DRBD
and cause "undefined results" (read: very likely data corruption).
The fix is to forcefully disconnect as soon as we notice that the peer
attached to the "wrong" dataset.

So far there was the possibility that we called

This included cases like:
drbd\_sync\_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
drbd\_asb\_recover\_1p

drbd\_bcast\_event

genlmsg\_new(GFP\_NOIO) --> may sleep
drbd\_sync\_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
drbd\_asb\_recover\_1p
drbd\_khelper
notify\_helper
mutex\_lock --> may sleep
While using GFP\_ATOMIC whould have been possible in the first two cases,
the real fix is to narrow the rcu\_read\_lock.

mlx5: update timecounter at least twice per counter overflow
[ Upstream commit 5d8678365c90b9ce1fd2243ff5ea562609f6cec1 ]
The timecounter needs to be updated at least once in half of the
cyclecounter interval to prevent timecounter\_cyc2time() interpreting a
new timestamp as an old value and causing a backward jump.
This would be an issue if the timecounter multiplier was so small that
the update interval would not be limited by the 64-bit overflow in
multiplication.
Shorten the calculated interval to make sure the timecounter is updated
in time even when the system clock is slowed down by up to 10%, the
multiplier is increased by up to 10%, and the scheduled overflow check
is late by 15%.

however it missed the other table so it has still been fully allocated

implies ppe should be used for BPSK (mcs 0). If there are no PPE
thresholds in the IE, or if for some NSS-RU pair there's no threshold
set for it (this could happen because it's a variable-sized field), it
means no PPE should not be used for that pair, so the value sent to FW

cw1200: Fix concurrency use-after-free bugs in cw1200\_hw\_scan()
[ Upstream commit 4f68ef64cd7feb1220232bd8f501d8aad340a099 ]
The function cw1200\_bss\_info\_changed() and cw1200\_hw\_scan() can be
concurrently executed.
The two functions both access a possible shared variable "frame.skb".
This shared variable is freed by dev\_kfree\_skb() in cw1200\_upload\_beacon(),
which is called by cw1200\_bss\_info\_changed(). The free operation is
protected by a mutex lock "priv->conf\_mutex" in cw1200\_bss\_info\_changed().
In cw1200\_hw\_scan(), this shared variable is accessed without the
protection of the mutex lock "priv->conf\_mutex".
Thus, concurrency use-after-free bugs may occur.
To fix these bugs, the original calls to mutex\_lock(&priv->conf\_mutex) and
mutex\_unlock(&priv->conf\_mutex) are moved to the places, which can
protect the accesses to the shared variable.

mlxsw: spectrum: Properly cleanup LAG uppers when removing port from LAG
[ Upstream commit be2d6f421f680e01d58f7cd452646e0d8586d49b ]
When a LAG device or a VLAN device on top of it is enslaved to a bridge,
the driver propagates the CHANGEUPPER event to the LAG's slaves.
This causes each physical port to increase the reference count of the
internal representation of the bridge port by calling
mlxsw\_sp\_port\_bridge\_join().
However, when a port is removed from a LAG, the corresponding leave()
function is not called and the reference count is not decremented. This
leads to ugly hacks such as mlxsw\_sp\_bridge\_port\_should\_destroy() that
try to understand if the bridge port should be destroyed even when its
reference count is not 0.
Instead, make sure that when a port is unlinked from a LAG it would see
the same events as if the LAG (or its uppers) were unlinked from a
bridge.
The above is achieved by walking the LAG's uppers when a port is
unlinked and calling mlxsw\_sp\_port\_bridge\_leave() for each upper that is
enslaved to a bridge.

drm/amd/display: Wait edp HPD to high in detect\_sink
[ Upstream commit 0a6414e75d231ee1bb7ffb2f5eb246b682a884cd ]
[Why]
In 99% user case, edp will be post by vbios.
In 1% / current case: Lenovo don't light up edp panel in vbios
post stage, vbios won't be lit up. Thus in dal when we init DCN
10 hw, we power up edp, then we start detect\_sink, but internal
time is too short, when we detect it, HPD is still low, so we don't
detect the edp, and edp shows black.
[How]
When we init hw, we wait edp HPD to high after power up edp.

[WHY]
On customer board, there is one pluse (1v , < 1ms) on
DDC\_CLK pin when plug / unplug DP cable. Driver will read
it and config DP to HDMI/DVI dongle.
[HOW]
If there is a real dongle, DDC\_CLK should be always pull high.

usb: musb: dsps: fix otg state machine
[ Upstream commit 6010abf2c2c0e382d7e8ee44bd11f343aae90cce ]
Due to lack of ID pin interrupt event on AM335x devices, the musb dsps
driver uses polling to detect usb device attach for dual-role port.
But in the case if a micro-A cable adapter is attached without a USB device
attached to the cable, the musb state machine gets stuck in a\_wait\_vrise
state waiting for the MUSB\_CONNECT interrupt which won't happen due to the
usb device is not attached. The state is stuck in a\_wait\_vrise even after
the micro-A cable is detached, which could cause VBUS retention if then the
dual-role port is attached to a host port.
To fix the problem, make a\_wait\_vrise as a transient state, then move the
state to either a\_wait\_bcon for host port or a\_idle state for dual-role
port, if no usb device is attached to the port.

arm64: KVM: Skip MMIO insn after emulation
[ Upstream commit 0d640732dbebed0f10f18526de21652931f0b2f2 ]
When we emulate an MMIO instruction, we advance the CPU state within
decode\_hsr(), before emulating the instruction effects.
Having this logic in decode\_hsr() is opaque, and advancing the state
before emulation is problematic. It gets in the way of applying
consistent single-step logic, and it prevents us from being able to fail
an MMIO instruction with a synchronous exception.
Clean this up by only advancing the CPU state \*after\* the effects of the
instruction are emulated.

properly mapped when pci\_disable\_msix() masks the vectors.
This patch will prevent errors when RDMA support is added for the new

In this case the 'target' buffer is coming from a list of build-ids that

probably we're safe, but since we're using strncpy() here, use strlcpy()

btrfs: use tagged writepage to mitigate livelock of snapshot
[ Upstream commit 3cd24c698004d2f7668e0eb9fc1f096f533c791b ]
Snapshot is expected to be fast. But if there are writers steadily
creating dirty pages in our subvolume, the snapshot may take a very long
time to complete. To fix the problem, we use tagged writepage for
snapshot flusher as we do in the generic write\_cache\_pages(), so we can
omit pages dirtied after the snapshot command.
This does not change the semantics regarding which data get to the
snapshot, if there are pages being dirtied during the snapshotting
operation. There's a sync called before snapshot is taken in old/new
case, any IO in flight just after that may be in the snapshot but this
depends on other system effects that might still sync the IO.
We do a simple snapshot speed test on a Intel D-1531 box:
fio --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=32 --bs=4k --rw=write --size=64G
--direct=0 --thread=1 --numjobs=1 --time\_based --runtime=120
--filename=/mnt/sub/testfile --name=job1 --group\_reporting & sleep 5;
time btrfs sub snap -r /mnt/sub /mnt/snap; killall fio
original: 1m58sec
patched: 6.54sec
This is the best case for this patch since for a sequential write case,
we omit nearly all pages dirtied after the snapshot command.
For a multi writers, random write test:
fio --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=32 --bs=4k --rw=randwrite --size=64G
--direct=0 --thread=1 --numjobs=4 --time\_based --runtime=120
--filename=/mnt/sub/testfile --name=job1 --group\_reporting & sleep 5;
time btrfs sub snap -r /mnt/sub /mnt/snap; killall fio
original: 15.83sec
patched: 10.35sec
The improvement is smaller compared to the sequential write case,
since we omit only half of the pages dirtied after snapshot command.

perf stat: Fix CSV mode column output for non-cgroup events
[ Upstream commit bc4da38a4789e7819fca4c7723ded0b86aea27c0 ]
When using the -x option, perf stat prints CSV-style output with one
event per line. For each event, it prints the count, the unit, the
event name, the cgroup, and a bunch of other event specific fields (such
as insn per cycles).
When you use CSV-style mode, you expect a normalized output where each
event is printed with the same number of fields regardless of what it is
so it can easily be imported into a spreadsheet or parsed.
For instance, if an event does not have a unit, then print an empty
field for it.
Although this approach was implemented for the unit, it was not for the
cgroup.
When mixing cgroup and non-cgroup events, then non-cgroup events would
not show an empty field, instead the next field was printed, make
columns not line up correctly.
This patch fixes the cgroup output issues by forcing an empty field
for non-cgroup events as soon as one event has cgroup.
Before:
 @ @cycles @foo @ 0 @100.00@@
2531614 @ @cycles @6420922@100.00@ @

After:

tty: serial: samsung: Properly set flags in autoCTS mode
[ Upstream commit 31e933645742ee6719d37573a27cce0761dcf92b ]
Commit 391f93f2ec9f ("serial: core: Rework hw-assited flow control support")
has changed the way the autoCTS mode is handled.
According to that change, serial drivers which enable H/W autoCTS mode must
set UPSTAT\_AUTOCTS to prevent the serial core from inadvertently disabling
TX. This patch adds proper handling of UPSTAT\_AUTOCTS flag.

[ Upstream commit 71ab1c0336c71ace5725740f200beca9667a339f ]
On (H)SCIF, sci\_submit\_rx() is called in the receive interrupt handler.
Hence if DMA submission fails, the interrupt handler should resume
handling reception using PIO, else no more data is received.
Make sci\_submit\_rx() return an error indicator, so the receive interrupt
handler can act appropriately.

serial: sh-sci: Fix locking in sci\_submit\_rx()
[ Upstream commit dd1f2250da95e87cb3e612858f94b14f99445a7c ]
Some callers of sci\_submit\_rx() hold the port spinlock, others don't.
During fallback to PIO, the driver needs to obtain the port spinlock.
If the lock was already held, spinlock recursion is detected, causing a
deadlock: BUG: spinlock recursion on CPU#0.
Fix this by adding a flag parameter to sci\_submit\_rx() for the caller to
indicate the port spinlock is already held, so spinlock recursion can be
avoided.
Move the spin\_lock\_irqsave() up, so all DMA disable steps are protected,
which is safe as the recently introduced dmaengine\_terminate\_async() can
be called in atomic context.

btrfs: harden agaist duplicate fsid on scanned devices
[ Upstream commit a9261d4125c97ce8624e9941b75dee1b43ad5df9 ]
It's not that impossible to imagine that a device OR a btrfs image is
copied just by using the dd or the cp command. Which in case both the
copies of the btrfs will have the same fsid. If on the system with
automount enabled, the copied FS gets scanned.
We have a known bug in btrfs, that we let the device path be changed
after the device has been mounted. So using this loop hole the new
copied device would appears as if its mounted immediately after it's
been copied.
For example:
Initially.. /dev/mmcblk0p4 is mounted as /
$ lsblk
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
mmcblk0 179:0 0 29.2G 0 disk
|-mmcblk0p4 179:4 0 4G 0 part /
|-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 500M 0 part /boot
|-mmcblk0p3 179:3 0 256M 0 part [SWAP]
`-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot/efi
$ btrfs fi show
Label: none uuid: 07892354-ddaa-4443-90ea-f76a06accaba
Total devices 1 FS bytes used 1.40GiB
devid 1 size 4.00GiB used 3.00GiB path /dev/mmcblk0p4
Copy mmcblk0 to sda
$ dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 of=/dev/sda
And immediately after the copy completes the change in the device
superblock is notified which the automount scans using btrfs device scan
and the new device sda becomes the mounted root device.
$ lsblk
NAME MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda 8:0 1 14.9G 0 disk
|-sda4 8:4 1 4G 0 part /
|-sda2 8:2 1 500M 0 part
|-sda3 8:3 1 256M 0 part
`-sda1 8:1 1 256M 0 part
mmcblk0 179:0 0 29.2G 0 disk
|-mmcblk0p4 179:4 0 4G 0 part
|-mmcblk0p2 179:2 0 500M 0 part /boot
|-mmcblk0p3 179:3 0 256M 0 part [SWAP]
`-mmcblk0p1 179:1 0 256M 0 part /boot/efi
$ btrfs fi show /
Label: none uuid: 07892354-ddaa-4443-90ea-f76a06accaba
Total devices 1 FS bytes used 1.40GiB
devid 1 size 4.00GiB used 3.00GiB path /dev/sda4
The bug is quite nasty that you can't either unmount /dev/sda4 or
/dev/mmcblk0p4. And the problem does not get solved until you take sda
out of the system on to another system to change its fsid using the
'btrfstune -u' command.

The rpm count may go down to zero before the memstick host powers on, so

So before doing card detection, increment the rpm count to avoid the
host gets runtime suspended. Balance the rpm count after card detection

[ Upstream commit 07d405769afea5718529fc9e341f0b13b3189b6f ]
If the user issues an "mmc extcsd read", the SD controller receives
what it thinks is a SEND\_IF\_COND command with an unexpected data block.
The resulting operations leave the FSM stuck in READWAIT, a state which
persists until the MMC framework resets the controller, by which point
the root filesystem is likely to have been unmounted.
A less heavyweight solution is to detect the condition and nudge the
FSM by asserting the (self-clearing) FORCE\_DATA\_MODE bit.

i2c-axxia: check for error conditions first
[ Upstream commit 4f5c85fe3a60ace555d09898166af372547f97fc ]
It was observed that when using seqentional mode contrary to the
documentation, the SS bit (which is supposed to only be set if
automatic/sequence command completed normally), is sometimes set
together with NA (NAK in address phase) causing transfer to falsely be
considered successful.
My assumption is that this does not happen during manual mode since the
controller is stopping its work the moment it sets NA/ND bit in status
register. This is not the case in Automatic/Sequentional mode where it
is still working to send STOP condition and the actual status we get
depends on the time when the ISR is run.
This patch changes the order of checking status bits in ISR - error
conditions are checked first and only if none of them occurred, the
transfer may be considered successful. This is required to introduce
using of sequentional mode in next patch.

tee: optee: avoid possible double list\_del()
[ Upstream commit b2d102bd0146d9eb1fa630ca0cd19a15ef2f74c8 ]
This bug occurs when:
- a new request arrives, one thread(let's call it A) is pending in
optee\_supp\_req() with req->busy is initial value false.
- tee-supplicant is killed, then optee\_supp\_release() is called, this
function calls list\_del(&req->link), and set supp->ctx to NULL. And
it also wake up process A.
- process A continues, it firstly checks supp->ctx which is NULL,
then checks req->busy which is false, at last run list\_del(&req->link).
This triggers double list\_del() and results kernel panic.
For solve this problem, we rename req->busy to req->in\_queue, and
associate it with state of whether req is linked to supp->reqs. So we
can just only check req->in\_queue to make decision calling list\_del()
or not.

iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Use explicit mb() when moving cons pointer
[ Upstream commit a868e8530441286342f90c1fd9c5f24de3aa2880 ]
After removing an entry from a queue (e.g. reading an event in
arm\_smmu\_evtq\_thread()) it is necessary to advance the MMIO consumer
pointer to free the queue slot back to the SMMU. A memory barrier is
required here so that all reads targetting the queue entry have
completed before the consumer pointer is updated.
The implementation of queue\_inc\_cons() relies on a writel() to complete
the previous reads, but this is incorrect because writel() is only
guaranteed to complete prior writes. This patch replaces the call to
writel() with an mb(); writel\_relaxed() sequence, which gives us the
read->write ordering which we require.

iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Avoid memory corruption from Hisilicon MSI payloads
[ Upstream commit 84a9a75774961612d0c7dd34a1777e8f98a65abd ]
The GITS\_TRANSLATER MMIO doorbell register in the ITS hardware is
architected to be 4 bytes in size, yet on hi1620 and earlier, Hisilicon
have allocated the adjacent 4 bytes to carry some IMPDEF sideband
information which results in an 8-byte MSI payload being delivered when
signalling an interrupt:
MSIAddr:
|----4bytes----|----4bytes----|
| MSIData | IMPDEF |
This poses no problem for the ITS hardware because the adjacent 4 bytes
are reserved in the memory map. However, when delivering MSIs to memory,
as we do in the SMMUv3 driver for signalling the completion of a SYNC
command, the extended payload will corrupt the 4 bytes adjacent to the
"sync\_count" member in struct arm\_smmu\_device. Fortunately, the current
layout allocates these bytes to padding, but this is fragile and we
should make this explicit.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Disable CSP for stream OUT ep
[ Upstream commit 244add8ebfb231c39db9e33b204bd0ce8f24f782 ]
In stream mode, when fast-forwarding TRBs, the stream number
is not cleared causing the new stream to not get assigned. So
we don't want controller to carry on transfers when short packet
is received. So disable the CSP for stream capable endpoint.
This is based on the 3.30a Programming guide, where table 3-1
device descriptor structure field definitions says for CSP bit
If this bit is 0, the controller generates an XferComplete event
and remove the stream. So if we keep CSP as 1 then switching between
streams would not happen as in stream mode, when fast-forwarding
TRBs, the stream number is not cleared causing the new stream to not get
assigned.

mtd6: 02000000 00020000 "flash"
Here "flash" is obviously the whole device and we know "rootfs"
is a bogus hack to point to a squashfs rootfs inside of the main
"upgrade partition". We know "RedBoot" is the first 0x40000 of
the flash and the "upgrade" partition follows from 0x40000 to
0x1f8000. So we have mtd0, 1, 4 and 6 covered.

arm64: dts: meson: Fix IRQ trigger type for macirq
[ Upstream commit 8b3e6f8999f8d704fccce225b9455b3fa639d1c9 ]
A long running stress test on a custom board shipping an AXG SoCs and a
Realtek RTL8211F PHY revealed that after a few hours the connection
speed would drop drastically, from ~1000Mbps to ~3Mbps. At the same time
the 'macirq' (eth0) IRQ would stop being triggered at all and as
consequence the GMAC IRQs never ACKed.
After a painful investigation the problem seemed to be due to a wrong
defined IRQ type for the GMAC IRQ that should be LEVEL\_HIGH instead of
EDGE\_RISING.
The change in the macirq IRQ type also solved another long standing
issue affecting this SoC/PHY where EEE was causing the network
connection to die after stressing it with iperf3 (even though much
sooner). It's now possible to remove the 'eee-broken-1000t' quirk as
well.

ARM: dts: Fix OMAP4430 SDP Ethernet startup
[ Upstream commit 84fb6c7feb1494ebb7d1ec8b95cfb7ada0264465 ]
It was noticed that unbinding and rebinding the KSZ8851 ethernet
resulted in the driver reporting "failed to read device ID" at probe.
Probing the reset line with a 'scope while repeatedly attempting to
bind the driver in a shell loop revealed that the KSZ8851 RSTN pin is
constantly held at zero, meaning the device is held in reset, and
does not respond on the SPI bus.
Experimentation with the startup delay on the regulator set to 50ms
shows that the reset is positively released after 20ms.
Schematics for this board are not available, and the traces are buried
in the inner layers of the board which makes tracing where the RSTN pin
extremely difficult. We can only guess that the RSTN pin is wired to a
reset generator chip driven off the ethernet supply, which fits the
observed behaviour.
Include this delay in the regulator startup delay - effectively
treating the reset as a "supply stable" indicator.
This can not be modelled as a delay in the KSZ8851 driver since the
reset generation is board specific - if the RSTN pin had been wired to
a GPIO, reset could be released earlier via the already provided support
in the KSZ8851 driver.
This also got confirmed by Peter Ujfalusi  based
on Blaze schematics that should be very close to SDP4430:
TPS22902YFPR is used as the regulator switch (gpio48 controlled):
Convert arm boot\_lock to raw The VOUT is routed to TPS3808G01DBV.
(SCH Note: Threshold set at 90%. Vsense: 0.405V).
According to the TPS3808 data sheet the RESET delay time when Ct is
open (this is the case in the schema): MIN/TYP/MAX: 12/20/28 ms.

ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Fix audio permanently muted
[ Upstream commit 2afdb4c41d7876e430b9bc6e2d7e2fe28609fd6a ]
Since commit 1137ceee76ba ("ARM: OMAP1: ams-delta: Don't request unused
GPIOs"), on-board audio has appeared muted. Believed to be unused GPIO
pin "hookflash1", apparently set high regardless of the corresponding
bit of "latch2" port attempted to be set low during .init\_machine(),
has been identified as the reason.
According to Amstrad E3 wiki, the purpose of the pin hasn't been
clearly identified. Original Amstrad software used to produce a high
pulse on it when the phone was taken off hook or recall was pressed.
With the current finding, we can assume the pin provides a kind of
audio mute function.
Proper resolution of the issue should be done in two steps:
- resolution of an issue with the pin state not reflecting the value
the corresponding bit of the port was attempted to be initialized
with,
- extension of on-board audio driver with a new control.
For now, rename the pin to "audio\_mute" to reflect its function and,
as a quick fix, hogg it as output low so on-board audio can produce
audible sound again.

media: v4l2-device: Link subdevices to their parent devices if available
[ Upstream commit ee494cf377e142f65f202fadf0d859f8e12119fb ]
Currently v4l2\_device\_register\_subdev\_nodes() does not initialize the
dev\_parent field of the video\_device structs it creates for subdevices
being registered. This leads to \_\_video\_register\_device() falling back
to the parent device of associated v4l2\_device struct, which often does
not match the physical device the subdevice is registered for.
Due to the problem above, the links between real devices and v4l-subdev
nodes cannot be obtained from sysfs, which might be confusing for the
userspace trying to identify the hardware.
Fix this by initializing the dev\_parent field of the video\_device struct
with the value of dev field of the v4l2\_subdev struct. In case of
subdevices without a parent struct device, the field will be NULL and the
old behavior will be preserved by the semantics of
\_\_video\_register\_device().

Move the async\_synchronize\_full call out of \_\_device\_release\_driver and
into driver\_detach.
The idea behind this is that the async\_synchronize\_full call will only
guarantee that any existing async operations are flushed. This doesn't do
anything to guarantee that a hotplug event that may occur while we are
doing the release of the driver will not be asynchronously scheduled.
By moving this into the driver\_detach path we can avoid potential deadlocks
as we aren't holding the device lock at this point and we should not have
the driver we want to flush loaded so the flush will take care of any
asynchronous events the driver we are detaching might have scheduled.

tipc: fix node keep alive interval calculation
[ Upstream commit f5d6c3e5a359c0507800e7ac68d565c21de9b5a1 ]
When setting LINK tolerance, node timer interval will be calculated
base on the LINK with lowest tolerance.
But when calculated, the old node timer interval only updated if current
setting value (tolerance/4) less than old ones regardless of number of
links as well as links' lowest tolerance value.
This caused to two cases missing if tolerance changed as following:
Case 1:
1.1/ There is one link (L1) available in the system
1.2/ Set L1's tolerance from 1500ms => lower (i.e 500ms)
1.3/ Then, fallback to default (1500ms) or higher (i.e 2000ms)
Expected:
node timer interval is 1500/4=375ms after 1.3
Result:
node timer interval will not being updated after changing tolerance at 1.3
since its value 1500/4=375ms is not less than 500/4=125ms at 1.2.
Case 2:
2.1/ There are two links (L1, L2) available in the system
2.2/ L1 and L2 tolerance value are 2000ms as initial
2.3/ Set L2's tolerance from 2000ms => lower 1500ms
2.4/ Disable link L2 (bring down its bearer)
Expected:
node timer interval is 2000ms/4=500ms after 2.4
Result:
node timer interval will not being updated after disabling L2 since
its value 2000ms/4=500ms is still not less than 1500/4=375ms at 2.3
although L2 is already not available in the system.
To fix this, we start the node interval calculation by initializing it to
a value larger than any conceivable calculated value. This way, the link
with the lowest tolerance will always determine the calculated value.

mac80211: fix deauth TX when we disconnect
[ Upstream commit f6c7f03f69f7422bc237bc79599e152d390b74e0 ]
The iTXQs stop/wake queue mechanism involves a whole bunch
of locks and this is probably why the call to
ieee80211\_wake\_txqs is deferred to a tasklet when called from
\_\_ieee80211\_wake\_queue.
Another advantage of that is that ieee80211\_wake\_txqs might
call the wake\_tx\_queue() callback and then the driver may
call mac80211 which will call it back in the same context.
The bug I saw is that when we send a deauth frame as a
station we do:
flush(drop=1)
tx deauth
flush(drop=0)
While we flush we stop the queues and wake them up
immediately after we finished flushing. The problem here is
that the tasklet that de-facto enables the queue may not have
run until we send the deauth. Then the deauth frame is sent
to the driver (which is surprising by itself), but the driver
won't get anything useful from ieee80211\_tx\_dequeue because
the queue is stopped (or more precisely because
vif->txqs\_stopped[0] is true).
Then the deauth is not sent. Later on, the tasklet will run,
but that'll be too late. We'll already have removed all the
vif etc...
Fix this by calling ieee80211\_wake\_txqs synchronously if we
are not waking up the queues from the driver (we check the
reason to determine that). This makes the code really
convoluted because we may call ieee80211\_wake\_txqs from
\_\_ieee80211\_wake\_queue. The latter assumes that
queue\_stop\_reason\_lock has been taken by the caller and
ieee80211\_wake\_txqs may release the lock to send the frames.

usb: dwc3: Correct the logic for checking TRB full in \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb()
[ Upstream commit b7a4fbe2300a8965ea760c7e871507b84aea17f6 ]
Availability of TRB's is calculated using dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left(), which
determines total available TRB's based on the HWO bit set in a TRB.
In the present code, \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb() is called with a TRB which
needs to be prepared for transfer. This \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb() calls
dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() to determine total available TRBs and set IOC bit
if the total available TRBs are zero. Since the present working TRB (which
is passed as an argument to \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb() ) doesn't yet have
the HWO bit set before calling dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left(), there are chances
that dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() wrongly calculates this present working TRB
as free(since the HWO bit is not yet set) and returns the total available
TRBs as greater than zero (including the present working TRB). This could
be a problem.
This patch corrects the above mentioned problem in \_\_dwc3\_prepare\_one\_trb()
by increementing the dep->trb\_enqueue at the last (after preparing the TRB)
instead of increementing at the start and setting the IOC bit only if the
total available TRBs returned by dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() is 1 . Since we are
increementing the dep->trb\_enqueue at the last, the present working TRB is
also considered as available by dwc3\_calc\_trbs\_left() and non zero value is
returned . So, according to the modified logic, when the total available
TRBs is equal to 1 that means the total available TRBs in the pool are 0.

smack: fix access permissions for keyring
[ Upstream commit 5b841bfab695e3b8ae793172a9ff7990f99cc3e2 ]
Function smack\_key\_permission() only issues smack requests for the
following operations:
- KEY\_NEED\_READ (issues MAY\_READ)
- KEY\_NEED\_WRITE (issues MAY\_WRITE)
- KEY\_NEED\_LINK (issues MAY\_WRITE)
- KEY\_NEED\_SETATTR (issues MAY\_WRITE)
A blank smack request is issued in all other cases, resulting in
smack access being granted if there is any rule defined between
subject and object, or denied with -EACCES otherwise.
Request MAY\_READ access for KEY\_NEED\_SEARCH and KEY\_NEED\_VIEW.
Fix the logic in the unlikely case when both MAY\_READ and
MAY\_WRITE are needed. Validate access permission field for valid
contents.

platform/x86: Fix config space access for intel\_atomisp2\_pm
[ Upstream commit 6a31061833a52a79c99221b6251db08cf377470e ]
We lose even config space access when we power gate the ISP
via the PUNIT. That makes lspci & co. produce gibberish.
To fix that let's try to implement actual runtime pm hooks
and inform the pci core that the device always goes to
D3cold. That will cause the pci core to resume the device
before attempting config space access.
This introduces another annoyance though. We get the
following error every time we try to resume the device:
intel\_atomisp2\_pm 0000:00:03.0: Refused to change power state, currently in D3
The reason being that the pci core tries to put the device
back into D0 via the standard PCI PM mechanism before
calling the driver resume hook. To fix this properly
we'd need to infiltrate the platform pm hooks (could
turn ugly real fast), or use pm domains (which don't
seem to exist on x86), or some extra early resume
hook for the driver (which doesn't exist either).
So maybe we just choose to live with the error?

ARM: dts: mmp2: fix TWSI2
[ Upstream commit 1147e05ac9fc2ef86a3691e7ca5c2db7602d81dd ]
Marvell keeps their MMP2 datasheet secret, but there are good clues
that TWSI2 is not on 0xd4025000 on that platform, not does it use
IRQ 58. In fact, the IRQ 58 on MMP2 seems to be a signal processor:
arch/arm/mach-mmp/irqs.h:#define IRQ\_MMP2\_MSP 58
I'm taking a somewhat educated guess that is probably a copy & paste
error from PXA168 or PXA910 and that the real controller in fact hides
at address 0xd4031000 and uses an interrupt line multiplexed via IRQ 17.
I'm also copying some properties from TWSI1 that were missing or
incorrect.
Tested on a OLPC XO 1.75 machine, where the RTC is on TWSI2.

arm64: ftrace: don't adjust the LR value
[ Upstream commit 6e803e2e6e367db9a0d6ecae1bd24bb5752011bd ]
The core ftrace code requires that when it is handed the PC of an
instrumented function, this PC is the address of the instrumented
instruction. This is necessary so that the core ftrace code can identify
the specific instrumentation site. Since the instrumented function will
be a BL, the address of the instrumented function is LR - 4 at entry to
the ftrace code.
This fixup is applied in the mcount\_get\_pc and mcount\_get\_pc0 helpers,
which acquire the PC of the instrumented function.
The mcount\_get\_lr helper is used to acquire the LR of the instrumented
function, whose value does not require this adjustment, and cannot be
adjusted to anything meaningful. No adjustment of this value is made on
other architectures, including arm. However, arm64 adjusts this value by
4.
This patch brings arm64 in line with other architectures and removes the
adjustment of the LR value.

s390/zcrypt: improve special ap message cmd handling
[ Upstream commit be534791011100d204602e2e0496e9e6ce8edf63 ]
There exist very few ap messages which need to have the 'special' flag
enabled. This flag tells the firmware layer to do some pre- and maybe
postprocessing. However, it may happen that this special flag is
enabled but the firmware is unable to deal with this kind of message
and thus returns with reply code 0x41. For example older firmware may
not know the newest messages triggered by the zcrypt device driver and
thus react with reject and the named reply code. Unfortunately this
reply code is not known to the zcrypt error routines and thus default
behavior is to switch the ap queue offline.
This patch now makes the ap error routine aware of the reply code and
so userspace is informed about the bad processing result but the queue
is not switched to offline state any more.

firmware/efi: Add NULL pointer checks in efivars API functions

Since commit:
ce2e6db554fa ("brcmfmac: Add support for getting nvram contents from EFI variables")
we have a device driver accessing the efivars API. Several functions in
the efivars API assume \_\_efivars is set, i.e., that they will be accessed
only after efivars\_register() has been called. However, the following NULL
pointer access was reported calling efivar\_entry\_size() from the brcmfmac
device driver:
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000008

Disassembly showed that the local static variable \_\_efivars is NULL,
which is not entirely unexpected given that it is a non-EFI platform.
So add a NULL pointer check to efivar\_entry\_size(), and to related
functions while at it. In efivars\_register() a couple of sanity checks
are added as well.

arm64: io: Ensure calls to delay routines are ordered against prior readX()
[ Upstream commit 6460d32014717686d3b7963595950ba2c6d1bb5e ]
A relatively standard idiom for ensuring that a pair of MMIO writes to a
device arrive at that device with a specified minimum delay between them
is as follows:
writel\_relaxed(42, dev\_base + CTL1);
readl(dev\_base + CTL1);
udelay(10);
writel\_relaxed(42, dev\_base + CTL2);
the intention being that the read-back from the device will push the
prior write to CTL1, and the udelay will hold up the write to CTL1 until
at least 10us have elapsed.
Unfortunately, on arm64 where the underlying delay loop is implemented
as a read of the architected counter, the CPU does not guarantee
ordering from the readl() to the delay loop and therefore the delay loop
could in theory be speculated and not provide the desired interval
between the two writes.
Fix this in a similar manner to PowerPC by introducing a dummy control
dependency on the output of readX() which, combined with the ISB in the
read of the architected counter, guarantees that a subsequent delay loop
can not be executed until the readX() has returned its result.

[ Upstream commit 5eb316e636eb298c204f5b368526d4480b63c0ba ]
Add support for the IIC code for the r8a77990 (R-Car E3).
It is not considered compatible with existing fallback bindings
due to the documented absence of automatic transmission registers.
These registers are currently not used by the driver and
thus the provides the same behaviour for "renesas,iic-r8a77990" and
"renesas,rcar-gen3-iic". The point of declaring incompatibility is
to allow for automatic transmission register support to be added to

f2fs: avoid GC causing encrypted file corrupted
[ Upstream commit 9bf1a3f73927492c8be127b642197125e9d52be8 ]
The encrypted file may be corrupted by GC in following case:
Time 1: | segment 1 blkaddr = A | GC -> | segment 2 blkaddr = B |
Encrypted block 1 is moved from blkaddr A of segment 1 to blkaddr B of
segment 2,
Time 2: | segment 1 blkaddr = B | GC -> | segment 3 blkaddr = C |
Before page 1 is written back and if segment 2 become a victim, then
page 1 is moved from blkaddr B of segment 2 to blkaddr Cof segment 3,
during the GC process of Time 2, f2fs should wait for page 1 written back
before reading it, or move\_data\_block will read a garbage block from
blkaddr B since page is not written back to blkaddr B yet.
Commit 6aa58d8a ("f2fs: readahead encrypted block during GC") introduce
ra\_data\_block to read encrypted block, but it forgets to add
f2fs\_wait\_on\_page\_writeback to avoid racing between GC and flush.

[ Upstream commit 2912289a518077ddb8214e05336700148e97e235 ]
The v4l2\_dv\_timings\_cap struct is used to do sanity checks when setting and
enumerating DV timings, ensuring that only valid timings as per the HW
capabilities are allowed.
However, many drivers just filled in 0 for the minimum width, height or
pixelclock frequency. This can cause timings with e.g. 0 as width and height
to be accepted, which will in turn lead to a potential division by zero.
Fill in proper values are minimum boundaries. 640x350 was chosen since it is
the smallest resolution in v4l2-dv-timings.h. Same for 13 MHz as the lowest
pixelclock frequency (it's slightly below the minimum of 13.5 MHz in the
v4l2-dv-timings.h header).

iio: adc: meson-saradc: fix internal clock names
[ Upstream commit 50314f98b0ac468218e7c9af8c99f215a35436df ]
Before this patch we are registering the internal clocks (for example on
Meson8b, where the SAR ADC IP block implements the divider and gate
clocks) with the following names:
- /soc/cbus@c1100000/adc@8680#adc\_div
- /soc/cbus@c1100000/adc@8680#adc\_en
This is bad because the common clock framework uses the clock to create
a directory in /clk. With such name, the directory creation
(silently) fails and the debugfs entry ends up being created at the
debugfs root.
With this change, the new clock names are:
- c1108680.adc#adc\_div
- c1108680.adc#adc\_en
This matches the clock naming scheme used in the PWM, Ethernet and MMC
drivers. It also fixes the problem with debugfs.
The idea is shamelessly taken from commit b96e9eb62841c5 ("pwm: meson:
Fix mux clock names").

clk: meson: meson8b: mark the CPU clock as CLK\_IS\_CRITICAL
[ Upstream commit 0dad1ec65bc30a549aba38d34a727309bbf41bc8 ]
We don't want the common clock framework to disable the "cpu\_clk" if
it's not used by any device. The cpufreq-dt driver does not enable the
CPU clocks. However, even if it would we would still want the CPU clock
to be enabled at all times because the CPU clock is also required even
if we disable CPU frequency scaling on a specific board.
The reason why we want the CPU clock to be enabled is a clock further up
in the tree:
Since commit 6f888e7bc7bd58 ("clk: meson: clk-pll: add enable bit") the
sys\_pll can be disabled. However, since the CPU clock is derived from
sys\_pll we don't want sys\_pll to get disabled. The common clock
framework takes care of that for us by enabling all parent clocks of our
CPU clock when we mark the CPU clock with CLK\_IS\_CRITICAL.
Until now this is not a problem yet because all clocks in the CPU
clock's tree (including sys\_pll) are read-only. However, once we allow
modifications to the clocks in that tree we will need this.

clk: meson: meson8b: fix the width of the cpu\_scale\_div clock
[ Upstream commit a8662eadd1032018f31e37deda811790b2326662 ]
According to the public S805 datasheet HHI\_SYS\_CPU\_CLK\_CNTL1[29:20] is
the register for the CPU scale\_div clock. This matches the code in
Amlogic's 3.10 GPL kernel sources:
N = (aml\_read\_reg32(P\_HHI\_SYS\_CPU\_CLK\_CNTL1) >> 20) & 0x3FF;
This means that the divider register is 10 bit wide instead of 9 bits.
So far this is not a problem since all u-boot versions I have seen are
not using the cpu\_scale\_div clock at all (instead they are configuring
the CPU clock to run off cpu\_in\_sel directly).
The fixes tag points to the latest rework of the CPU clocks. However,
even before the rework it was wrong. Commit 7a29a869434e8b ("clk: meson:
Add support for Meson clock controller") defines MESON\_N\_WIDTH as 9 (in
drivers/clk/meson/clk-cpu.c). But since the old clk-cpu implementation
this only carries the fixes tag for the CPU clock rewordk.

[ Upstream commit a5ac1ead32c9aac285f6436e09b4f6111996e9b8 ]
The cpu\_div3 clock (cpu\_in divided by 3) generates a signal with a duty
cycle of 33%. The CPU clock however requires a clock signal with a duty
cycle of 50% to run stable.
cpu\_div3 was observed to be problematic when cycling through all
available CPU frequencies (with additional patches on top of this one)
while running "stress --cpu 4" in the background. This caused sporadic
hangs where the whole system would fully lock up.
Amlogic's 3.10 kernel code also does not use the cpu\_div3 clock either
when changing the CPU clock.

RDMA/core: Sync unregistration with netlink commands
[ Upstream commit 01b671170d7f82b959dad6d5dbb44d7a915e647d ]
When the rdma device is getting removed, get resource info can race with
device removal, as below:
CPU-0 CPU-1
-------- --------
rdma\_nl\_rcv\_msg()
nldev\_res\_get\_cq\_dumpit()
mutex\_lock(device\_lock);
get device reference
mutex\_unlock(device\_lock); [..]
ib\_unregister\_device()
/\* Valid reference to
\* device->dev exists.
\*/
ib\_dealloc\_device()
[..]
provider->fill\_res\_entry();
Even though device object is not freed, fill\_res\_entry() can get called on
device which doesn't have a driver anymore. Kernel core device reference
count is not sufficient, as this only keeps the structure valid, and
doesn't guarantee the driver is still loaded.
Similar race can occur with device renaming and device removal, where
device\_rename() tries to rename a unregistered device. While this is fine
for devices of a class which are not net namespace aware, but it is
incorrect for net namespace aware class coming in subsequent series. If a
class is net namespace aware, then the below [1] call trace is observed in
above situation.
Therefore, to avoid the race, keep a reference count and let device
unregistration wait until all netlink users drop the reference.

When the managed cache is enabled, the last reference count
of a workgroup must be used for its workstation.
Otherwise, it could lead to incorrect (un)freezes in

A typical race as follows:
Thread 1 (In the reclaim path) Thread 2
workgroup\_freeze(grp, 1) refcnt = 1
...
workgroup\_unfreeze(grp, 1) refcnt = 1
workgroup\_get(grp) refcnt = 2 (x)
workgroup\_put(grp) refcnt = 1 (x)
...unexpected behaviors
\* grp is detached but still used, which violates cache-managed
freeze constraint.

The video device release() callback for video-i2c driver frees the whole

when video\_unregister\_device() is called, the release callback is executed.
However, in video\_i2c\_remove() some fields (v4l2\_dev, lock, and queue\_lock)
in struct video\_i2c\_data are still accessed after video\_unregister\_device()
is called.
This fixes the use after free by moving the code from video\_i2c\_remove()

The same dependency needs to be propagated here to make it work correctly

another problem with a circular dependency, as we use 'select NETDEVICES'.
This is something we really should not do anyway, as a driver symbol should
never select another major subsystem, so let's turn that into a 'depends
on'. I don't see any downsides of that, as NETDEVICES is only disabled in
rather obscure cases that are not relevant to the users of cxgb4i.

drm/amd/display: calculate stream->phy\_pix\_clk before clock mapping
[ Upstream commit 08e1c28dd521c7b08d1b0af0bae9fb22ccc012a4 ]
[why]
phy\_pix\_clk is one of the variable used to check if one PLL can be shared
with displays having common mode set configuration. As of now
phy\_pix\_clock varialbe is calculated in function dc\_validate\_stream().
dc\_validate\_stream() function is called after clocks are assigned for the
new display. Due to this during hotplug, when PLL sharing conditions are
checked for new display phy\_pix\_clk variable will be 0 and for displays
that are already enabled phy\_pix\_clk will have some value. Hence PLL will
not be shared and if the display hardware doesn't have any more PLL to
assign, mode set will fail due to resource unavailability.
[how]
Instead of only calculating the phy\_pix\_clk variable after the PLL is
assigned for new display, this patch calculates phy\_pix\_clk also during
the before assigning the PLL for new display.

drm/rockchip: fix for mailbox read size
[ Upstream commit fa68d4f8476bea4cdf441062b614b41bb85ef1da ]
Some of the functions (like cdn\_dp\_dpcd\_read, cdn\_dp\_get\_edid\_block)
allow to read 64KiB, but the cdn\_dp\_mailbox\_read\_receive, that is
used by them, can read only up to 255 bytes at once. Normally, it's
not a big issue as DPCD or EDID reads won't (hopefully) exceed that
value.
The real issue here is the revocation list read during the HDCP
authentication process. (problematic use case:
https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/third\_party/kernel/+/chromeos-4.4/drivers/gpu/drm/rockchip/cdn-dp-reg.c#1152)
The list can reach 127\*5+4 bytes (num devs \* 5 bytes per ID/Bksv +
4 bytes of an additional info).
In other words - CTSes with HDCP Repeater won't pass without this
fix. Oh, and the driver will most likely stop working (best case
scenario).

If a TX hang occurs, we attempt to recover by incrementally resetting.
If we're starved for CPU time, it's possible the reset doesn't actually
complete (or even fire) before another tx\_timeout fires causing us to
fly through the different resets without actually doing them.
This adds a bit to set and check if a timeout recovery is already
pending and, if so, bail out of tx\_timeout. The bit will get cleared at

promiscuous activity. This gets rid of the bogus message, but doesn't
affect privilege checks, since we really only care if the unprivileged

platform/chrome: don't report EC\_MKBP\_EVENT\_SENSOR\_FIFO as wakeup
[ Upstream commit 6ad16b78a039b45294b1ad5d69c14ac57b2fe706 ]
EC\_MKBP\_EVENT\_SENSOR\_FIFO events can be triggered for a variety of
reasons, and there are very few cases in which they should be treated as
wakeup interrupts (particularly, when a certain
MOTIONSENSE\_MODULE\_FLAG\_\* is set, but this is not even supported in the
mainline cros\_ec\_sensor driver yet). Most of the time, they are benign
sensor readings. In any case, the top-level cros\_ec device doesn't know
enough to determine that they should wake the system, and so it should
not report the event. This would be the job of the cros\_ec\_sensors
driver to parse.
This patch adds checks to cros\_ec\_get\_next\_event() such that it doesn't
signal 'wakeup' for events of type EC\_MKBP\_EVENT\_SENSOR\_FIFO.
This patch is particularly relevant on devices like Scarlet (Rockchip
RK3399 tablet, known as Acer Chromebook Tab 10), where the EC firmware
reports sensor events much more frequently. This was causing
/sys/power/wakeup\_count to increase very frequently, often needlessly
interrupting our ability to suspend the system.

[ Upstream commit 187fade88ca0ff2df9d360ca751d948d73db7095 ]
If mapping the CvP BAR fails, we still can configure the FPGA via
PCI config space access. In this case the iomap pointer is NULL.
On x86\_64, passing NULL address to pci\_iounmap() generates
"Bad IO access at port 0x0" output with stack call trace. Fix it.

MIPS: Boston: Disable EG20T prefetch
[ Upstream commit 5ec17af7ead09701e23d2065e16db6ce4e137289 ]
The Intel EG20T Platform Controller Hub used on the MIPS Boston
development board supports prefetching memory to optimize DMA transfers.
Unfortunately for unknown reasons this doesn't work well with some MIPS
CPUs such as the P6600, particularly when using an I/O Coherence Unit
(IOCU) to provide cache-coherent DMA. In these systems it is common for
DMA data to be lost, resulting in broken access to EG20T devices such as
the MMC or SATA controllers.
Support for a DT property to configure the prefetching was added a while
back by commit 549ce8f134bd ("misc: pch\_phub: Read prefetch value from
device tree if passed") but we never added the DT snippet to make use of
it. Add that now in order to disable the prefetching & fix DMA on the
affected systems.

drm/vc4: ->x\_scaling[1] should never be set to VC4\_SCALING\_NONE
[ Upstream commit 0560054da5673b25d56bea6c57c8d069673af73b ]
For the YUV conversion to work properly, ->x\_scaling[1] should never
be set to VC4\_SCALING\_NONE, but vc4\_get\_scaling\_mode() might return
VC4\_SCALING\_NONE if the horizontal scaling ratio exactly matches the
horizontal subsampling factor. Add a test to turn VC4\_SCALING\_NONE
into VC4\_SCALING\_PPF when that happens.
The old ->x\_scaling[0] adjustment is dropped as I couldn't find any
mention to this constraint in the spec and it's proven to be
unnecessary (I tested various multi-planar YUV formats with scaling
disabled, and all of them worked fine without this adjustment).

crypto: aes\_ti - disable interrupts while accessing S-box
[ Upstream commit 0a6a40c2a8c184a2fb467efacfb1cd338d719e0b ]
In the "aes-fixed-time" AES implementation, disable interrupts while
accessing the S-box, in order to make cache-timing attacks more
difficult. Previously it was possible for the CPU to be interrupted
while the S-box was loaded into L1 cache, potentially evicting the
cachelines and causing later table lookups to be time-variant.
In tests I did on x86 and ARM, this doesn't affect performance
significantly. Responsiveness is potentially a concern, but interrupts
are only disabled for a single AES block.
Note that even after this change, the implementation still isn't
necessarily guaranteed to be constant-time; see
https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf for a discussion
of the many difficulties involved in writing truly constant-time AES
software. But it's valuable to make such attacks more difficult.

s390/qeth: utilize virtual MAC for Layer2 OSD devices
[ Upstream commit b144b99fff69a5bc0d34c8e168bedb88c68ca23d ]
By default, READ MAC on a Layer2 OSD device returns the adapter's
burnt-in MAC address. Given the default scenario of many virtual devices
on the same adapter, qeth can't make any use of this address and
therefore skips the READ MAC call for this device type.
But in some configurations, the READ MAC command for a Layer2 OSD device
actually returns a pre-provisioned, virtual MAC address. So enable the
READ MAC code to detect this situation, and let the L2 subdriver
call READ MAC for OSD devices.
This also removes the QETH\_LAYER2\_MAC\_READ flag, which protects L2
devices against calling READ MAC multiple times. Instead protect the
whole call to qeth\_l2\_request\_initial\_mac().

scsi: lpfc: Fix LOGO/PLOGI handling when triggerd by ABTS Timeout event
[ Upstream commit 30e196cacefdd9a38c857caed23cefc9621bc5c1 ]
After a LOGO in response to an ABTS timeout, a PLOGI wasn't issued to
re-establish the login. An nlp\_type check in the LOGO completion
handler failed to restart discovery for NVME targets. Revised the
nlp\_type check for NVME as well as SCSI.
While reviewing the LOGO handling a few other issues were seen and
were addressed:
- Better lock synchronization around ndlp data types
- When the ABTS times out, unregister the RPI before sending the LOGO
so that all local exchange contexts are cleared and nothing received
while awaiting LOGO/PLOGI handling will be accepted.
- LOGO handling optimized to:
Wait only R\_A\_TOV for a response.
It doesn't need to be retried on timeout. If there wasn't a
response, a PLOGI will be sent, thus an implicit logout
applies as well when the other port sees it.
If there is a response, any kind of response is considered "good"
and the XRI quarantined for a exchange qualifier window.
- PLOGI is issued as soon a LOGO state is resolved.

gpu: ipu-v3: image-convert: Prevent race between run and unprepare
[ Upstream commit 819bec35c8c9706185498c9222bd244e0781ad35 ]
Prevent possible race by parallel threads between ipu\_image\_convert\_run()
and ipu\_image\_convert\_unprepare(). This involves setting ctx->aborting
to true unconditionally so that no new job runs can be queued during
unprepare, and holding the ctx->aborting flag until the context is freed.
Note that the "normal" ipu\_image\_convert\_abort() case (e.g. not during
context unprepare) should clear the ctx->aborting flag after aborting
any active run and clearing the context's pending queue. This is because
it should be possible to continue to use the conversion context and queue
more runs after an abort.

genirq/affinity: Spread IRQs to all available NUMA nodes
[ Upstream commit b82592199032bf7c778f861b936287e37ebc9f62 ]
If the number of NUMA nodes exceeds the number of MSI/MSI-X interrupts
which are allocated for a device, the interrupt affinity spreading code
fails to spread them across all nodes.
The reason is, that the spreading code starts from node 0 and continues up
to the number of interrupts requested for allocation. This leaves the nodes
past the last interrupt unused.
This results in interrupt concentration on the first nodes which violates
the assumption of the block layer that all nodes are covered evenly. As a
consequence the NUMA nodes above the number of interrupts are all assigned
to hardware queue 0 and therefore NUMA node 0, which results in bad
performance and has CPU hotplug implications, because queue 0 gets shut
down when the last CPU of node 0 is offlined.
Go over all NUMA nodes and assign them round-robin to all requested
interrupts to solve this.

ath10k: fixup extended per sta tx statistics
[ Upstream commit 539b44e70c5b4ad82d2c0c97a4dfb37523d891f6 ]
I had a couple concerns with this code. First, we definitely need to
set the error code if the kzalloc() fails. Secondly, I was worried that
if we didn't set "arsta->tx\_stats" to NULL after freeing it, then it
looks to me like it might lead to a use after free. I can't test that,
but it's harmless to set it to NULL so I did.

gpiolib: Fix possible use after free on label
[ Upstream commit 18534df419041e6c1f4b41af56ee7d41f757815c ]
gpiod\_request\_commit() copies the pointer to the label passed as
an argument only to be used later. But there's a chance the caller
could immediately free the passed string(e.g., local variable).
This could trigger a use after free when we use gpio label(e.g.,
gpiochip\_unlock\_as\_irq(), gpiochip\_is\_requested()).
To be on the safe side: duplicate the string with kstrdup\_const()
so that if an unaware user passes an address to a stack-allocated
buffer, we won't get the arbitrary label.
Also fix gpiod\_set\_consumer\_name().

pinctrl: bcm2835: Use raw spinlock for RT compatibility
[ Upstream commit 3c7b30f704b6f5e53eed6bf89cf2c8d1b38b02c0 ]
The BCM2835 pinctrl driver acquires a spinlock in its ->irq\_enable,
->irq\_disable and ->irq\_set\_type callbacks. Spinlocks become sleeping
locks with CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_RT\_FULL=y, therefore invocation of one of the
callbacks in atomic context may cause a hard lockup if at least two GPIO
pins in the same bank are used as interrupts. The issue doesn't occur
with just a single interrupt pin per bank because the lock is never
contended. I'm experiencing such lockups with GPIO 8 and 28 used as
level-triggered interrupts, i.e. with ->irq\_disable being invoked on
reception of every IRQ.
The critical section protected by the spinlock is very small (one bitop
and one RMW of an MMIO register), hence converting to a raw spinlock
seems a better trade-off than converting the driver to threaded IRQ
handling (which would increase latency to handle an interrupt).

Fix this by sanitizing idx before using it to index dma->buflist

to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].

How it works

## Accurate, reliable vulnerability insights at your fingertips

The Secunia Research team from Flexera is comprised of several security specialists who conduct vulnerability research in various products in addition to testing, verifying and validating public vulnerability reports. Since its inception in 2002, the goal of the Secunia Research team is to provide the most accurate and reliable source of vulnerability intelligence.

Delivering the world’s best vulnerability intelligence requires skill and passion. Team members continually develop their skills exploring various high-profile closed and open-source software using a variety of approaches, focusing chiefly on thorough code audits and binary analysis. The team has received industry recognition, including naming members to [Microsoft’s Most Valuable Security Researchers](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2019/08/07/announcing-2019-msrc-most-valuable-security-researchers/) list.

Secunia researchers discover hard-to-find vulnerabilities that aren’t normally identified with techniques such as fuzzing, and the results have been impressive. Members of the Secunia Research team have discovered critical vulnerabilities in products from vendors including Microsoft, Symantec, IBM, Adobe, RealNetworks, Trend Micro, HP, Blue Coat, Samba, CA, Mozilla and Apple.

The team produces invaluable security advisories based on research of the vulnerabilities affecting any given software update. Sometimes a single update can address multiple vulnerabilities of varying criticalities and threats; but these advisories aggregate and distill findings down to a single advisory perfect for the prioritization of patching efforts within [Software Vulnerability Manager](/products/software-vulnerability-manager). Criticality scores are consistently applied along with details around attack vector and other valuable details within [Software Vulnerability Research](/products/software-vulnerability-research/secunia-research). Illegitimate vulnerability reports are also investigated and rejected so you can focus only on what truly matters.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems
* [linux-hwe](/security/cves?package=linux-hwe) - Linux hardware enablement (HWE) kernel

## Details

USN-3930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.10.

This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware

Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 18.10 for Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Mathias Payer and Hui Peng discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the

Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2018-19824](/security/CVE-2018-19824))

Shlomi Oberman, Yuli Shapiro, and Ran Menscher discovered an information

leak in the Bluetooth implementation of the Linux kernel. An attacker

within Bluetooth range could use this to expose sensitive information

(kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-3459](/security/CVE-2019-3459), [CVE-2019-3460](/security/CVE-2019-3460))

Jann Horn discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel

contained a use-after-free vulnerability. An attacker in a guest VM with

access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a denial of service (guest VM

crash). ([CVE-2019-6974](/security/CVE-2019-6974))

Jim Mattson and Felix Wilhelm discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when using nested virtual machines.

A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code in the host system.

([CVE-2019-7221](/security/CVE-2019-7221))

Felix Wilhelm discovered that an information leak vulnerability existed in

the KVM subsystem of the Linux kernel, when nested virtualization is used.

A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (host

system memory to a guest VM). ([CVE-2019-7222](/security/CVE-2019-7222))

Jann Horn discovered that the eBPF implementation in the Linux kernel was

insufficiently hardened against Spectre V1 attacks. A local attacker could

use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-7308](/security/CVE-2019-7308))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the user-

space API for crypto (af\_alg) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-8912](/security/CVE-2019-8912))

Jakub Jirasek discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the SCTP

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-8956](/security/CVE-2019-8956))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory

when handling certain errors while reading files. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (excessive memory consumption).

([CVE-2019-8980](/security/CVE-2019-8980))

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the IPMI

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with access to the

IPMI character device files could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash). ([CVE-2019-9003](/security/CVE-2019-9003))

Jann Horn discovered that the SNMP NAT implementation in the Linux kernel

performed insufficient ASN.1 length checks. An attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-9162](/security/CVE-2019-9162))

Jann Horn discovered that the mmap implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly check for the mmap minimum address in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to assist exploiting a kernel NULL pointer

dereference vulnerability. ([CVE-2019-9213](/security/CVE-2019-9213))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
