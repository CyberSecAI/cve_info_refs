Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-8008:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds write

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory boundaries. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system and perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The document doesn't explicitly specify the attack vector, but it implies that it involves the processing of a malicious file by Adobe Acrobat or Reader.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious PDF or similar document that triggers the out-of-bounds write when processed by a vulnerable version of Adobe Acrobat or Reader.
- The attacker would need to deliver this malicious file to the target user, possibly through social engineering or other means.
- The attacker would need to get the user to open this malicious document in the vulnerable software.
