- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple issues in ld64 in the Xcode toolchains.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Compiling code without proper input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution with user privilege.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted code that is compiled using a vulnerable version of ld64.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the ld64 tool during the code compilation process.
