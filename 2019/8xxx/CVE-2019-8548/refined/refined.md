CVE-2019-8548:
  - Root cause: The issue was caused by partially entered passcodes not clearing when the device went to sleep.
  - Weakness: Incomplete clearing of passcode input.
  - Impact: A partially entered passcode may not clear when the device goes to sleep.
  - Attack vector: If a user partially enters a passcode and the device goes to sleep before completion, the partially entered passcode remains uncleared.
  - Solution: The issue was addressed by clearing the passcode when a locked device sleeps.
