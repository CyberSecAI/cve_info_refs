Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of file uploads within the `common/FileAttachment.jsp` file of Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus (SDP). Specifically, when the `module` parameter is set to `CustomLogin`, the application skips file extension checks, allowing arbitrary file uploads.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Missing File Extension Check:** The core vulnerability is the lack of proper file extension validation for the `CustomLogin` module, unlike other modules where such checks are in place. This allows an attacker to bypass security measures intended to prevent uploading malicious files.
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** This weakness allows an attacker to upload any file type to the `/custom/login` directory, circumventing intended limitations.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Webshell Upload:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to upload a webshell, granting them remote command execution capability on the server.
    *   **Direct File Access:** Uploaded files in the `/custom/login` directory can be directly accessed by navigating to the URL `host:port/custom/login/filename`, potentially exposing sensitive data or further
    compromising the system.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is conducted via a crafted HTTP POST request to the `common/FileAttachment.jsp` endpoint. The request includes multipart form data with specific parameters such as `module` set to `CustomLogin`, and a file in the `filePath` parameter.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
    *   **Minimum Permissions:** The attacker only requires minimal permissions (e.g., a "guest" account) to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ServiceDesk Plus server.

*   **Additional Details:**
    * The vulnerability affects versions of Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus before 10.0 build 10012, specifically including versions 9.4 and 10.0.
    * The exploit example provides a detailed HTTP POST request that can be used to upload a JSP webshell.
