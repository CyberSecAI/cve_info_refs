Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to ZoneMinder, specifically focusing on the "orderby injection" mentioned in the Seebug title, as well as other identified vulnerabilities, including those that are similar:

**1. skins/classic/views/events.php line 44 SQL Injection (and related)**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `filter` parameter within the `events.php` view, specifically through the `parseFilter` function. The `cnj` and `obr` parameters within the filter structure are directly incorporated into SQL queries.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection via unsanitized input in `$_REQUEST['filter']`, leading to vulnerable SQL query construction
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `filter` parameter, specifically the `terms` array and its associated `cnj` or `obr` values, in HTTP GET requests.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `events.php` endpoint with crafted `filter` parameters.

    *   **Technical Details**
        *   The original vulnerable code in versions prior to 1.32.3 takes the input from `$_REQUEST['filter']`, and the sql parameter comes from  `$filter['terms'][$i]['cnj']` or `$filter['terms'][$i]['obr']`
        *   In 1.32.3, the vulnerable variable was changed to `$terms[$i]['cnj']`, which comes from `$filter['Query']['terms']`
        *   The parameters `countSql` or `eventsSql` can be injected through crafted input.
        *   Example PoC: `index.php?view=events&page=1&filter[Query][terms][0][attr]=MonitorId&filter[Query][terms][0][op]=%3D&filter[Query][terms][0][val]=1&filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]=1%2b1)and%20sleep(3)%23`

**2. SQL Query Error Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** When a SQL query results in an error, the error message, including the injected SQL, is displayed to the user without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to displaying unsanitized SQL error messages.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that is then executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a SQL error by injecting malicious code into the `filter` parameter that leads to an error and will result in the injected code being reflected in the error message.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to craft HTTP requests to trigger a SQL error with malicious input in parameters like `filter`.

    *   **Technical Details**
        *   Vulnerable code is in `includes/database.php` line 120.
        *   SQL errors and messages are displayed without validation or sanitization.
        *   Example PoC: `https://95.143.216.108/zm/index.php?view=events&page=1&filter[terms][0][attr]=MonitorId&filter[terms][0][op]=%3D&filter[terms][0][val]=1&filter[terms][0][cnj]=1432%3Cimg/src=/%20onerror=alert\`1\`%3E`

**3. skins/classic/views/control.php line 35 Second-Order SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `$groupSql` parameter is retrieved from the database and directly used in a SQL query without sanitization. This makes it vulnerable to second-order SQL injection, which means the attacker injects malicious code into the database first, and the vulnerability is then exploited when that injected code is later retrieved and used in a query.
*   **Weakness:** Second-order SQL Injection due to lack of input validation when retrieving data from the database.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed, leading to data breaches and server compromise.
*   **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious SQL code into the `monitors` value in the database via `includes/action.php` (line 748) when creating a group, and then triggering it in `control.php`.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Attacker must be able to create groups with malicious monitor IDs.

    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   `control.php` line 35 takes the `$groupSql` parameter from the database and concatenates it into an SQL query.
        *   `includes/action.php` line 748 inserts the `$monitors` array into the database.
        *   Step 1 PoC: `index.php?action=group&newGroup[MonitorIds][]=1&newGroup[MonitorIds][]=2') or sleep(3)#&newGroup[Name]=132`
        *   Step 2 PoC: `http://127.0.0.1/zoneminder/www/?view=control&mid=1&group={groupid}`

**4. skins/classic/views/controlcap.php Reflected XSS**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization of the `newControl` parameters, specifically `newControl[MinTiltRange]`.
*   **Weakness:** Reflected XSS by directly outputting unsanitized user-provided data.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code via the `newControl[MinTiltRange]` parameter in an HTTP GET request to `controlcap.php`.
*  **Attacker Capability:** Craft HTTP requests with malicious parameters.

    *   **Technical Details**
        *   Most variables in `controlcap.php` are not filtered, and are passed directly from the mid parameter.
        *   Example PoC: `?view=controlcap&newControl[MinTiltRange]=2333%22/%3E%3Cimg/src=/%20onerror=alert(1)%3E`

**5. includes/functions.php Daemon Control Command Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** The provided content mentions a command injection vulnerability related to daemon control, though it lacks specific details.
*   **Weakness:** Command injection
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** The specific vector is not explained in the provided content.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker's capabilities and position are not mentioned in the provided content.

**6. ajax/status.php line 276 ORDER BY SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:**  Improper sanitization of the `sort` parameter, which is directly used in an `ORDER BY` clause of a SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability in the `ORDER BY` clause.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can control how the SQL query is sorted and possibly execute arbitrary SQL code via the order by clause.
*   **Attack Vector:** By manipulating the `sort` parameter in a GET request to `ajax/status.php`.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `ajax/status.php` endpoint with a crafted `sort` parameter.
    * **Technical Details:**
         *  The code directly uses the `sort` parameter in the `ORDER BY` clause of an SQL query.
         *  Example PoC: `http://127.0.0.1/zoneminder/www/?request=status&entity=monitor&element=id&id=1&sort=123`

**7. ajax/status.php Line 393 SQL Injection**

*   **Root Cause:** Similar to the SQL injection in `events.php`, this involves unsanitized input in the `filter` parameter, specifically through the `cnj` parameter, which is then incorporated into a SQL query.
*   **Weakness:** SQL injection via unsanitized `filter` parameter
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary SQL queries can be executed, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating the `filter` parameter, specifically the `terms` array and its associated `cnj` value, in HTTP GET requests.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable `ajax/status.php` endpoint with a crafted `filter` parameter.

    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   There are two SQL injection points in `ajax/status.php`, on lines 393 and 406.
        *   The SQL parameters come from `$filter['terms'][$i]['cnj']` or `$filter['terms'][$i]['obr']`
        *   Example PoC:  `index.php?request=status&entity=nearevents&element=id&id=13&layout=text&filter[Query][terms][0][cnj]=233)%20||1=1%23`

In summary, the provided content details multiple vulnerabilities, including multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities affecting different parts of the application, several reflected XSS vulnerabilities stemming from improper output encoding of user-supplied data and one command injection with limited details. The "orderby injection" mentioned in the title of the Seebug article corresponds to the vulnerability identified in `ajax/status.php` line 276.

The vulnerabilities appear to stem from lack of input sanitization and output encoding, leading to both SQL injection and XSS attack vectors and a second order sql injection. These vulnerabilities affect versions prior to 1.32.3, with the details suggesting some code structure changes in 1.32.3 but the underlying vulnerabilities persist.
