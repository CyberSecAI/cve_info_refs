Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Consul 1.4 handles ACL token replication in secondary datacenters when specific conditions are met. During the replication process, a token's secret is inadvertently replaced with the literal string `<hidden>` in the local state store of the secondary datacenter. This string `<hidden>` is used for redacting token values in internal endpoints, but in this case, it was erroneously used as the actual secret.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Token Secret Handling:** The ACL token replication process in secondary datacenters fails to correctly handle token secrets, leading to the storage of `<hidden>` instead of the actual secret.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By using the `<hidden>` secret, an attacker can potentially gain access to resources associated with an arbitrary token, leading to privilege escalation within the secondary datacenter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can use the `<hidden>` secret to impersonate another token, potentially gaining access to sensitive resources within the secondary datacenter.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the compromised token has elevated privileges, the attacker can gain those privileges as well, potentially leading to further damage.
*   **Limited Scope:** The compromised token is only valid within the secondary datacenter and cannot be used to create new policies or globally valid tokens in the primary datacenter.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Calls:** Attackers can exploit this by using the `<hidden>` secret in API calls that require a token, gaining access as if they had the original token's secret.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to a Secondary Datacenter:** The attacker needs to have access to a client within a secondary datacenter that has ACL token replication enabled.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `<hidden>` token secret vulnerability and its impact to exploit it.
*   **Token Replication Enabled:** ACL token replication must be enabled on the secondary datacenters.
*  **Specific ACL Configuration**: The assigned replication token must have read permissions on ACLs but not write permissions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `<hidden>` secret can be detected using the `consul acl token read -token "<hidden>" -self` command.
*   Consul versions 1.4.0, 1.4.1, and 1.4.2 are affected.
*   Consul 1.4.3 fixes the vulnerability, and if a token exists with the `<hidden>` value, it will be automatically removed upon upgrade and when the secondary datacenter's Consul server gains leadership.
*   The vulnerability occurs when only a single token needs replicating from the primary datacenter.
