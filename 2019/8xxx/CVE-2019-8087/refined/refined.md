Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8087:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the Adobe Experience Manager's (AEM) `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint. Specifically, the `keymap` parameter within this endpoint is susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Input provided through the `keymap` parameter is not properly sanitized or encoded before being reflected in the response, allowing for injection of malicious scripts.
- The vulnerability exists because the `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint was exposed, and the application did not properly handle user-supplied input in the `keymap` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
- Sensitive information disclosure through stealing cookies, session tokens or other data.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.
- Defacing the web application.
- Other malicious actions, such as keystroke logging or browser hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `keymap` parameter of the `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint. When a user accesses this crafted URL, the injected script will execute in their browser.
-  The vulnerability can be exploited if the `/crx/de` endpoint is exposed, which would allow direct access to the vulnerable endpoint. Otherwise, it could be exploited by bypassing the AEM Dispatcher.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs and induce victims to click on them or have the victim's browser automatically load them.
- The attacker needs to be able to bypass any access controls that protect the /setPreferences.jsp endpoint, such as the AEM Dispatcher if the /crx/de endpoint is not exposed.

**Additional Information**

The content provides more details than the typical CVE description, such as:
- A specific vulnerable parameter (`keymap`) and endpoint (`/setPreferences.jsp`)
- The method used to confirm XSS (injecting `<h1>` then `alert()` tags)
- Specific payload example `<https://www.tcl.com/crx/de/setPreferences.jsp;.html?language=en&keymap=testmap%3Csvg%20onload=%22alert(document.domain)%22%3E>`
- The finding was initially reported with a filter bypass, but later it was discovered that the `/crx/de` endpoint was directly exposed, negating the need for bypass.
- A link to a relevant tool `aem-hacker` which can help in testing for this attack vector.
- Timeline of the disclosure and vendor interaction.
- The vulnerability is a reflected XSS.
- The advisory confirms that AEM versions 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, and 6.5 are vulnerable.
- The advisory notes the fix in the Cumulative Fix Pack for 6.3 SP3 and Service Packs for versions 6.4 and 6.5
