{
  "CVE-2019-8953": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the 'Description' parameter within the HAProxy package's listener configuration page.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not sanitize user input before displaying it on the page.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'Description' field of an HAProxy listener. This code will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the HAProxy listener configuration page, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to access the HAProxy listener configuration page (haproxy_listeners_edit.php) and insert the malicious payload into the 'Description' field.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the pfSense web interface with permissions to modify HAProxy settings. They also need knowledge of the vulnerable parameter."
