[00:00] hi there in this video I'm going to
[00:02] demonstrate to you man in the middle
[00:04] attack with my victims device and the
[00:07] attacker device both of the devices has
[00:10] to be connected to the same local
[00:12] network in this video I'm going to
[00:14] intercept traffic in and out coming from
[00:17] my victims victims device I'm going to
[00:21] demonstrate to you on ES File Explorer
[00:24] that has over a hundred million installs
[00:29] latest versions so let me open that now
[00:35] we're going to set up my attackers voice
[00:36] I'm using the something
[00:38] software is connected to the same
[00:40] network I have picked evil.com the
[00:44] website that the victim will be
[00:46] redirected to so let me start the attack
[00:53] now let's go to
[01:04] now let's go to settings and scroll down
[01:11] to about the app and let's say we want
[01:15] to visit official website
[01:19] we got a JavaScript are going to be
[01:21] redirected and we end up on evil.com so
[01:29] let's go back and this can be also done
[01:32] through help however in this case
[01:36] attackers website is going to be
[01:38] displayed in a web view so user has no
[01:42] idea about the URL because you cannot
[01:45] see the URL bar this could end up either
[01:49] by downloading another application or
[01:52] with a fishing technique to make user
[01:55] insert his credentials let's say guys
[02:00] you should always use HTTPS in your app
[02:04] so that's it guys see you next time bye
