Based on the provided content, here's an analysis in relation to CVE-2019-8345:

**Summary:** The video demonstrates a Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack against the ES File Explorer application. The attack leverages the application's use of HTTP for a specific action (likely related to a help or "About" function that displays a website), allowing the attacker to redirect the user to a malicious website.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the ES File Explorer app's use of HTTP instead of HTTPS for a specific communication. This allows an attacker to intercept and manipulate the network traffic during that communication, redirecting the user to an attacker-controlled website.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Lack of HTTPS:** The application fails to use HTTPS for a specific network request, making it vulnerable to MitM attacks.
    *   **Insecure WebView:** The application displays the attacker's website within a web view. This web view hides the URL bar, making it harder for the user to discern that they have been redirected to a malicious site, which also implies the web view may not be properly configured to prevent malicious scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Website Redirection:** The user is redirected to a malicious website instead of the intended one.
    *   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** The attacker's website can then be used for various purposes, such as:
        *   Downloading malware/other applications
        *   Phishing attacks to steal user credentials
        *   Other malicious activities (e.g., drive-by downloads)
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *  **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The attack is performed by intercepting and manipulating the network traffic between the victim's device and the server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Same Local Network:** The attacker's device must be connected to the same local network as the victim's device.
    *   **MitM Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and manipulate network traffic (e.g., using tools like ARP spoofing, and a web server to host the malicious site).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The video specifically uses ES File Explorer as an example, highlighting the potential risk in applications using unencrypted HTTP connections.
*   The lack of HTTPS and the lack of a visible URL in the web view create a significant security vulnerability, making it easier for the attack to succeed.
*   The attacker is able to change the redirection to a malicious site through a man in the middle attack. This indicates the web url being loaded from a non-HTTPS server and is hence vulnerable to tampering during transit.

**Relation to CVE-2019-8345:**
While the provided video content does not explicitly mention CVE-2019-8345, the type of vulnerability it shows (HTTP redirection leading to MitM attack) is the type of vulnerability that would be assigned a CVE, and could be associated with this CVE ID depending on the specific application being vulnerable and if the CVE description were to match. Without the official CVE description for CVE-2019-8345, a clear match cannot be made at this time.
