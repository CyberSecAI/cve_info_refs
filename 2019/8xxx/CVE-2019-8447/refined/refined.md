- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `ServiceExecutor` resource in Jira lacks proper CSRF protection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can trigger the creation of export files.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation is done through a CSRF attack, where a malicious website or email can trick a logged-in user into making unintended requests to the vulnerable Jira application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link. The attacker does not require direct access to the Jira application but needs the user's session.
