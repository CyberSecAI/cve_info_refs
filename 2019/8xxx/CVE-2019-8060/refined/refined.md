Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-8060:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Command Injection

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in Adobe Acrobat and Reader. This allows an attacker to inject malicious commands that are then executed by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the user's system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:** The document does not specify the exact attack vector. However, given that this is a command injection vulnerability, it's likely that this is achieved by manipulating input data processed by the application. A malicious PDF file or a similar mechanism could be used to exploit the flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to provide input that triggers the command injection. This could be via a maliciously crafted PDF document, or another method that interfaces with the vulnerable component. The attacker would need to have the target user open the malicious file or interact with the vulnerable component.
