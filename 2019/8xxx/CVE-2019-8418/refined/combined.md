## Description

![@wxdigo8](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45277475?u=6f41862c7fecbd29a0835abefbaf6e4b616093da&v=4&size=48)[wxdigo8](https://github.com/wxdigo8)opened [on Jan 6, 2019](https://github.com/seacms/seacms-v7.2/issues/2#issue-396272666)

0x01 analysis

Navigate to line 307~328 of the /mermber.php file：

0x02 recurrent

First we register two users: User A, User B

This is my registered user A and user B. Let's see how to try any user password modification.

Url：<http://localhost:8081/member.php?mod=repsw4>

POST：repswname=shate&repswcode=y&repswnew1=shate&repswnew2=shate

This shows that the password reset is successful and the password of User B is completely changed.

0x03 repair

The first thing we want to consider is the value of the repswcode inserted at the time of registration, and the value when the password was successfully changed:

1, this value can not be a number

2, this value can not be less than 10 characters

3, this value can be an encrypted value to prevent blasting
