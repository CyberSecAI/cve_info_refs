Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-8444

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-provided input within the WikiRenderer component of Atlassian Jira. Specifically, the way the renderer parses image attributes and URLs allows for the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript. The renderer incorrectly creates URLs for image attributes that start with `http:.`, which, combined with the way attributes are parsed, can lead to a persistent XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the context of a user's browser session when viewing the affected content.
- Improper Input Neutralization: The WikiRenderer fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, especially in image attributes within comments and worklogs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Data theft or manipulation
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirection to malicious websites
- Persistent XSS: Since the malicious payload is stored in the database (within comments or worklogs), the XSS is persistent and will execute each time a user views the affected content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Comment/Worklog Injection: An attacker can inject the malicious code into a Jira instance via a comment or worklog entry.
- Malicious Input in Image Attributes: The malicious code leverages the way the WikiRenderer parses URLs in image attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker needs to be an authenticated Jira user capable of creating comments or worklogs.
- No Special Privileges: The vulnerability can be triggered with basic user privileges.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Jira versions from 7.6.4 to 8.1.0.
- The fix was included in versions 7.13.6, 8.3.2, and 8.4.0.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific image attribute that starts with "http:.", which allows injecting Javascript.
- The exploit is demonstrated by embedding a javascript alert into an image width attribute.
