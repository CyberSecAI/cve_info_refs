The provided content describes a vulnerability in D-Link DIR-823G routers, which aligns with the format and nature of CVE information. Here's a breakdown of the relevant details:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an **incorrect access control** in the `/bin/goahead` binary of the D-Link DIR-823G router. This allows unauthorized remote users to modify Wi-Fi settings.

*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper authentication and authorization when accessing the `SetWLanRadioSettings` HNAP API. This allows arbitrary modification of Wi-Fi settings without requiring valid credentials.

*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to **enable a Guest WiFi** network on the router. This guest network is created with no password by default and allows unauthorized access to the network. This can lead to various security risks such as unauthorized network access, data theft, or further attacks on devices within the network.

*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to the `SetWLanRadioSettings` HNAP API. This request includes specific parameters (e.g., `RadioID`, `Enabled`) that instruct the router to enable the guest network. The vulnerability is exploitable **remotely** without authentication.

*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router. They do not need prior authentication to the device. The attacker only requires network access to the router.

The provided content gives more detail than a typical CVE description by providing a proof of concept (POC), including the specific headers and body data needed to trigger the vulnerability. It also explains the impact of the exploitation in more concrete terms by explaining that the attacker can create a guest wifi network with no password.
