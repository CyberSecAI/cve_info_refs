{
  "CVE-2019-8379": {
    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the function `be_uint32_read()` located in `endianrw.h` in AdvanceCOMP. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to a binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact when a victim opens a specially crafted file.",
    "Root cause": "The `be_uint32_read()` function in `endianrw.h` attempts to dereference a pointer without proper validation, leading to a null pointer dereference when the provided pointer is NULL.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference",
      "Improper input validation"
     ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (segmentation fault) or potentially other unspecified impacts such as arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted input file (abc or mng) to be processed by the advmng application.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted file as input to the vulnerable application."
