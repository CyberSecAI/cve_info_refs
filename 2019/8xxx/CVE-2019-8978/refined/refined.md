  "cve": "CVE-2019-8978",
  "attack_vector": "Remote",
  "root_cause": "Improper authentication vulnerability due to a race condition in Ellucian Banner Web Tailor when used with SSO Manager.",
  "vulnerability": "An improper authentication vulnerability (CWE-287) exists in Banner Web Tailor and Banner Enterprise Identity Services when SSO Manager is used as the authentication mechanism. A user's unique identifier (UDCID) is leaked via a cookie, which can be exploited through a race condition. Repeatedly requesting the initial Banner Web Tailor main page with the IDMSESSID cookie set to the victim's UDCID allows remote attackers to steal a victim's session.",
  "impact": "Account compromise leading to information disclosure and loss of data integrity. For a student, an attacker could drop them from courses, reject financial aid, or change personal information. For a professor, they could be unable to manage courses or allow malicious students to input false final grades. For an administrator, user information could be changed, or false holds placed on student accounts.",
  "affected_products": [
    "Banner Web Tailor versions 8.8.3, 8.8.4, 8.9",
    "Banner Enterprise Identity Services versions 8.3, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, 8.4"
  ],
  "remediation": "Organizations affected should update to the latest version.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to know or capture a victim's UDCID.",
  "exploit": "The vulnerability allows remote attackers to steal a victim's session (and cause a denial of service) by repeatedly requesting the initial Banner Web Tailor main page with the IDMSESSID cookie set to the victim's UDCID. During a login attempt by a victim, the attacker can leverage the race condition and will be issued the SESSID that was meant for this victim."
