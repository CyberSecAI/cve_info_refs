Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the registration form of the "Online store system". Specifically, the email format validation can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing special characters and XSS payloads to be injected into the email field during user registration.
- **Bypass of Client-Side Validation**: The vulnerability can be triggered by directly posting data to `sent_register.php` which bypasses the standard checks done on the registration form

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the email field, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** An attacker crafts a POST request directly to `sent_register.php` with a malicious email address containing XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker can be any user of the application who is able to register. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker must know or be able to identify the vulnerable `sent_register.php` endpoint

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to bypass the front-end validation and inject XSS using a crafted email address during user registration.
- The vulnerability is specifically related to the `sent_register.php` file.
