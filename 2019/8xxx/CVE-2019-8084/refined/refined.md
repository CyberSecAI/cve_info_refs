Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-8084:

**CVE-2019-8084** is a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability found in **Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)**.

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint of AEM, specifically within the `keymap` parameter. Input provided to this parameter is not properly sanitized, leading to the possibility of injecting malicious scripts.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected XSS:** The input provided through the `keymap` parameter is reflected back in the response without proper encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Insecure AEM Instance:** The presence of an exposed `/crx/de` endpoint indicates a misconfigured AEM instance, which can further ease exploitation.
    *   **Lack of Dispatcher Protection:** The vulnerability was exploitable because the `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint was not being blocked by the AEM Dispatcher (WAF) in the affected system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
    *   This can be used to:
        *   Steal cookies/session tokens.
        *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
        *   Deface the website.
        *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
        *   Access sensitive information available to the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes the vulnerable `/setPreferences.jsp` endpoint and a malicious script within the `keymap` parameter.
    *   Example URL: `https://www.tcl.com/crx/de/setPreferences.jsp;.html?language=en&keymap=testmap%3Csvg%20onload=%22alert(document.domain)%22%3E`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking on the malicious link, or otherwise, inject it into a location accessible to the user's browser (e.g., via another XSS).
    *  The attacker needs to identify a vulnerable AEM instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The blog post details the process of discovering the vulnerability using google dorking to find exposed AEM endpoints.
*   It was discovered on TCL's US website but is applicable to any AEM instance with the same vulnerability.
*   The post mentions that while this specific vulnerability was later resolved by AEM, it might still be present in older, unpatched systems.
*   The researcher initially believed that the ‘..;’ AEM filter bypass was needed for the XSS, but this wasn't necessary since the `/crx/de` endpoint was already exposed.
*   The researcher reported the vulnerability to TCL and, after a long period of back and forth and lack of action on the vendor's side, decided to publish their findings for general security awareness.
*   The Adobe security bulletin also acknowledges this vulnerability and lists it as a **Moderate** severity.
