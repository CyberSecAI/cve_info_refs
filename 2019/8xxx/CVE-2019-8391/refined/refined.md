Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `type` parameter of the `/qdpm/index.php/configuration` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the `type` parameter, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
    - **Session hijacking:** An attacker can steal a user's session cookie, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
    - **Defacement:** An attacker could modify the appearance of the web page.
    - **Redirection:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites.
    - **Data theft:** Attackers can potentially steal sensitive information by executing malicious scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code within the `type` parameter.
- The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `/qdpm/index.php/configuration` page with a specially crafted `type` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to click it. This could be achieved through social engineering (e.g., sending the link via email, chat, or forum).
- The attacker needs no authentication to exploit the vulnerability

**Technical Details:**

- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `type`
- **Vulnerable URL:** `/qdpm/index.php/configuration`
- **Attack Pattern Example:** `tasks_columns_list<script>bKtx(9366)</script>`
- **Example HTTP GET Request:**
```
