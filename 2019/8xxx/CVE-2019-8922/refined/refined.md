    "Root cause of vulnerability": "SDP Heap Overflow; this vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests as well. By requesting a huge number of attributes at the same time, an attacker can overflow the static buffer provided to hold the response.",

    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the SDP protocol handling of attribute requests. By requesting a huge number of attributes simultaneously, an attacker can overflow the static buffer allocated to hold the response. The function `sdp_append_to_buf` doesn't check if there's enough space in the destination buffer before appending data, leading to a heap overflow.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap overflow in SDP attribute request handling due to lack of size checks when appending data to a buffer.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A heap overflow can be triggered, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted SDP request with a large number of attribute requests which can cause a response larger than the allocated buffer.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send L2CAP packets to the target device. This requires Bluetooth connectivity."

      "Root cause of vulnerability": "BlueZ versions through 5.48 are susceptible to vulnerabilities which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
