Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8320:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2019-8320 and its official description, which involves a directory traversal vulnerability when decompressing a tar archive in RubyGems. The description is consistent with the information found in the analyzed text.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in RubyGems' failure to properly check for symlinks before deleting the target destination during gem extraction. Before making new directories or touching files (which now include path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the target destination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a malicious gem could delete arbitrary files on the userâ€™s machine, presuming the attacker could guess at paths.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The main vulnerability is a directory traversal issue where a crafted symlink in a gem archive can cause deletion of files outside the intended target directory.
- **Missing symlink check:** The lack of proper verification of symlinks allows the attacker to bypass intended path checks.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Deletion**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to delete any file on the victim's machine that the user running `gem` had access to.
- **Data Loss**: Unintentional file deletion could lead to data loss for users.
- **System Instability**: Deletion of critical system files could lead to an unusable system.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- A malicious gem archive is crafted with specific symlinks and file paths.
- The victim installs the malicious gem via `gem install`.
- Upon gem extraction, the vulnerable code would remove the destination by traversing through a symlink pointing to a target path outside the gem directory causing file deletion.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Craft a malicious gem:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a specially crafted gem with symlinks and targeted file paths.
- **Victim interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the victim into installing their malicious gem. This can be achieved through social engineering, or by publishing the malicious gem to public repositories.

**Additional Notes:**

- The Red Hat bugzilla entry (Bug 1692512) and SUSE information confirm that this is a directory traversal issue due to the lack of symlink checks before deletion.
- The upstream patch provided in the bug description demonstrates how symlinks are now being checked before removing a destination
- Multiple vendors have provided fixes and security advisories for this issue, indicating the widespread impact across the Ruby ecosystem.
