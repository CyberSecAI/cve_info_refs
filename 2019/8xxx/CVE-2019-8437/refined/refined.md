The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the njiandan-cms application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to induce a logged-in administrator to perform unintended actions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing forged requests from other sites to be executed as if they were legitimate.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can create a malicious HTML page that, when visited by a logged-in admin, automatically sends a request to add a new admin user with attacker-controlled credentials.
- This can lead to complete compromise of the CMS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that automatically submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.
- The victim, while logged in as an admin on the CMS, visits the malicious page.
- The victim's browser automatically submits the form to the CMS.
- The CMS, lacking CSRF protection, processes the request as if it was legitimate, adding an attacker-controlled admin user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a webpage that the target admin will visit. This can be done via email, forum posts, or other methods to spread a link to the malicious webpage.
- The attacker doesn't require direct access to the CMS, but needs an admin user to be logged in to the CMS.
