- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The issue stems from insufficient checks within the Messages application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Inadequate validation allows users removed from an iMessage conversation to potentially alter the conversation's state.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users removed from an iMessage conversation may still be able to alter the state of the conversation, potentially causing confusion or other unintended consequences.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by a user who was previously part of an iMessage conversation but has since been removed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have been a participant in the iMessage conversation prior to being removed.
