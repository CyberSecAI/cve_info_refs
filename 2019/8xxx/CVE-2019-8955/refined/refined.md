Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8955:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the KIST cell scheduler in Tor. The KIST (Kernel Input Stream Tunnel) mechanism is responsible for managing the flow of data to the kernel for a given socket. The core issue is that the KIST scheduler was not taking into account the existing data within the output buffer ("outbuf") before writing new data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Ignoring Outbuf Length:** The KIST scheduler was acting as if the outbuf was always empty, regardless of any data already present from previous scheduling rounds.
*   **Outbuf Overflow:**  Because of the above, if the kernel was busy/full and Tor wasn't able to flush the outbuf, KIST could write past the highwater mark, leading to the outbuf length exceeding INT_MAX, causing an assertion failure and a "Bug()" message in the logs.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** An attacker could exploit this by sending data to the Tor client or relay in a way that would cause the outbuf to fill beyond capacity, eventually resulting in a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a denial-of-service condition. A Tor client or relay could run out of memory and crash due to the outbuf overflow.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network. An attacker does not need physical access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Network Traffic:** The attack is performed by sending carefully crafted network traffic to a Tor client or relay. The details of how this data should be crafted is not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to reach a Tor client or relay.
*   **Data Transmission:** The attacker needs to be able to send data to the target using the Tor network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Tor versions 0.3.2.1-alpha and later.
*   The fix involves modifying KIST to consider the existing outbuf length when calculating available space.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as TROVE-2019-001 within the Tor project.
*   The severity is rated as "moderate" by SUSE.
