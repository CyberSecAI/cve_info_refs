Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the stored XSS vulnerability in VNote:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored XSS
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly filter specific HTML tags (`<img>`, `<iframe>`, `<video>`), allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  An attacker crafts a malicious payload containing a JavaScript script embedded within an HTML tag (e.g., `<iframe src="javascript:alert('xss')">`).
    2.  The attacker injects this payload into a note within VNote.
    3.  When a user accesses the note containing the malicious payload, the JavaScript code is executed in their browser.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    *   Data theft (e.g., cookies, session tokens)
    *   Account takeover
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Defacement of the VNote interface
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify notes in VNote.
*   **Affected Versions:** VNote-2.2 on Linux.
*   **Mitigation:** The application needs to filter HTML tags.
