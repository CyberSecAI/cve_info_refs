- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Wi-Fi component where the broadcast MAC address was being used.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privacy issue due to the broadcasting of the MAC address.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A device can be passively tracked by its Wi-Fi MAC address.
- **Attack vectors**: Passive tracking of a device via its broadcast MAC address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not require any active interaction, this is a passive tracking vulnerability.
