Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-8901:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the "Run script over SSH" action within the Shortcuts app. The issue stems from a lack of proper host key verification when connecting to a previously known SSH server.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary vulnerability is the absence of host key verification when using the "Run script over SSH" shortcut action. This absence allows for a potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker, with a privileged network position, can intercept SSH traffic from the vulnerable shortcut action. This interception could potentially expose sensitive information transmitted over the SSH connection, or potentially enable the attacker to modify the content being transferred.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack is network-based and requires the attacker to be in a "privileged network position." This typically means the attacker has control over a network segment the vulnerable device is connected to or can perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position, capable of intercepting network traffic. They don't need to have physical access to the device, but rather need to be able to man-in-the-middle the SSH communication.

The document states: "This issue was addressed by verifying host keys when connecting to a previously-known SSH server." This indicates the fix was to ensure proper validation of the server's SSH key, which prevents a MITM attack.
