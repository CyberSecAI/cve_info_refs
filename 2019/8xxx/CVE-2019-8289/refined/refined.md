Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8289:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `user_view.php` page of the "Online store system" application. The application displays user data without sanitizing it, specifically the `adidas_member_email` field, when an administrative user views the user list.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it on the `user_view.php` page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the `adidas_member_email` field.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of proper input sanitization or encoding of user-provided data, specifically the email field, when displayed in the user view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the email field during registration. When an administrative user views the user list, the malicious script will execute in their browser.
*   **Cookie Stealing:** A common attack vector using this vulnerability is to steal the administrator's session cookies, potentially giving the attacker full control of the application.
*   **Account Compromise:** By stealing cookies, attackers may be able to gain unauthorized access to administrative accounts, leading to further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Registration:** An attacker registers with a malicious payload in the email field.
*   **Admin User Access:** An administrative user navigates to the user list view (`user_view.php`), triggering the execution of the stored XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Register:** The attacker must have the ability to register an account on the vulnerable application.
*   **No special privileges required**: The attacker does not need to have any special privileges or access within the application to inject the XSS payload.
*   **Knowledge of Admin Access Point:** While not needed to inject, the attacker would benefit from knowledge of the admin page to target the exploit.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is `echo '<td>'. $row['adidas_member_email'] . '</td>';` within `user_view.php`, where `$row['adidas_member_email']` is directly output without sanitization.
*   The exploit code example demonstrates how to inject a simple JavaScript alert: `"><script>alert(1);</script>%40email.com`
