Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8076:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an insecure library loading issue in the Adobe Application Manager installer for Windows. Specifically, it's a DLL hijacking vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading (DLL Hijacking):** The installer attempts to load a DLL from an insecure location. If an attacker can place a malicious DLL with the same name in that location, the installer will load and execute it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's system, with the privileges of the user running the installer.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker would need to place a malicious DLL in the insecure location the installer attempts to load the library from.
*   The user would then need to execute the vulnerable installer for the malicious DLL to be loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to write a malicious DLL.
*   The attacker must have write access to a location on the victim's system that is searched by the vulnerable installer before the intended location of the legitimate DLL
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects the installer for Adobe Application Manager version 10.0 on Windows.
*   The existing Adobe Application Manager is not affected.
*   The fix is to use a patched installer, version 2019 Release.
