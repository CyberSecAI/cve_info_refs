# WebkitGTK+: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202003-22**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in WebKitGTK+, the worst
of which may lead to arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/webkit-gtk** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.26.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.26.4** |

### Background

WebKitGTK+ is a full-featured port of the WebKit rendering engine,
suitable for projects requiring any kind of web integration, from hybrid
HTML/CSS applications to full-fledged web browsers.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in WebKitGTK+. Please
review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, cause a Denial of
Service condition, bypass intended memory-read restrictions, conduct a
timing side-channel attack to bypass the Same Origin Policy or obtain
sensitive information.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All WebkitGTK+ users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/webkit-gtk-2.26.4"

```
