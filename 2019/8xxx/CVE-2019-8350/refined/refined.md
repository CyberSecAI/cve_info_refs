The content is related to CVE-2019-8350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Simple â€“ Better Banking Android application did not disable autocomplete for the password field in its sign-in form. This allowed the user's password to be stored in the keyboard's autocomplete cache.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: The application's failure to disable password autocomplete allowed user passwords to be stored in keyboard caches.
- CWE-200: Information Exposure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to user passwords could be gained.
- Potentially affected thousands of users.
- Compromise of datastores containing keyboard autocompletion caches would lead to disclosure of user's password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local device compromise: Access to the device's keyboard cache, either directly or by malware.
- Cloud compromise: If a keyboard app syncs autocomplete data to the cloud (e.g., SwiftKey), a breach of the keyboard vendor's servers would expose stored passwords.
- User's keyboard app: Vulnerability depends on the security of the user's selected keyboard application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local or physical access to a user's device.
- Ability to compromise a third-party keyboard provider's cloud storage.
