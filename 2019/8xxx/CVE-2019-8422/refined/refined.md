Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the SQL injection vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or filtering of the `$description` parameter in the `ContentController.php` file when adding news articles. The `$description` variable is directly inserted into an SQL query without adequate preparation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not validate or escape user-supplied input in the `description` field, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach/Modification:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the database user's permissions, an attacker might gain further control over the system.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could potentially disrupt the application by injecting malicious SQL queries.
- **Full database access:** As shown by the example, attackers could extract sensitive information such as database version, and potentially gain full database access

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/admin/content/add` endpoint when creating a news article.
- **Malicious `description` Parameter:** The core of the attack is injecting SQL code into the `description` parameter within the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must be logged into the admin panel.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `description` parameter is vulnerable.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to modify HTTP POST requests (e.g., using Burp Suite) to inject SQL code.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is found in `\apps\admin\controller\content\ContentController.php` file at line 68-154.
- The `$description` variable is processed by `strip_tags()`, `mb_substr()`, and `clear_html_blank()` functions, which are insufficient to prevent SQL injection.
- The example uses the following payload in the "description" field: `' or (SELECT * FROM (SELECT(name_const(version(),1)),name_const(version(),1))a) or '`
- The `clear_html_blank()` function only removes whitespace-related characters, which does not provide any protection against SQL injection.
