{
  "CVE-2019-8341": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Jinja2 2.10. The from_string function is prone to Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes the \"source\" parameter as a template object, renders it, and then returns it. The attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in a URI.",
    "Root cause": "The `from_string` function in Jinja2 2.10 directly renders the 'source' parameter, which is a template object, without proper sanitization or sandboxing. This allows for Server Side Template Injection (SSTI).",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Server Side Template Injection (SSTI)"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary code via the `from_string` function, leading to command injection and potentially full system compromise.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "URI parameter manipulation"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the 'source' parameter that is passed to the `from_string` function.",
        "Additional Details": "The vulnerability exists in the `from_string` function in Jinja2 which renders the 'source' parameter. The vulnerability is only triggered when Jinja templates are loaded from untrusted sources. String formatting via str.format was also identified as a weakness in the jinja2 library. The exploit can be triggered by passing a payload through a URI. This vulnerability can lead to a full system compromise. This CVE has been disputed by the maintainer and third parties."
