Based on the provided content, here's information relevant to CVE-2019-8903:

*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal
*   **Root Cause:** The application failed to properly sanitize the URL, allowing attackers to traverse directories outside the intended "public" directory. Specifically, the code was vulnerable to path traversal attempts using characters like "./" and encoded characters like "%2e/".
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL containing directory traversal sequences, an attacker could potentially access sensitive files or resources outside the designated public directory.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files/resources.
*   **Affected versions:** According to the discussion, versions 3.2.0, 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are affected. The reporter indicates that the CVE is too broad as it claims all versions are affected, which is inaccurate.
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.2.3 with a new fix for escaped space. Additionally, older versions received patches up to version 3.2.4. A security.js definition file was provided as a solution for very old versions.
*   **Additional Information:** Using a reverse proxy like Nginx or Apache in front of Total.js applications mitigates the risk.
