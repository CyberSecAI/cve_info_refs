{
  "CVE-2019-8321": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Since Gem::UserInteraction#verbose calls say without escaping, escape sequence injection is possible.",
    "root_cause": "The `Gem::UserInteraction#verbose` function calls the `say` function without escaping, allowing for the injection of escape sequences.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Escape sequence injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary escape sequences which could lead to modification of terminal output, potentially misleading users or causing other unintended behavior.",
        "attack_vectors": [
        "Network"
      ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the output of the verbose command within RubyGems. This could happen when an attacker controls a gem repository or when the verbose option is used with user-supplied inputs from external sources. No authentication required.",
    "additional_information": "This vulnerability is present because the verbose output is not properly sanitized before being printed to the console."
