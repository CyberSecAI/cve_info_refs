## CVE-2019-8446

The content discusses CVE-2019-8446, an information disclosure vulnerability in Atlassian Jira.

**Root Cause:** Incorrect authorization check in the `/rest/issueNav/1/issueTable` resource.

**Vulnerability:** User enumeration is possible due to the ability to differentiate between valid and invalid usernames.

**Impact:** An attacker can identify valid usernames on a Jira instance.

**Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/rest/issueNav/1/issueTable` with a JQL query containing a username. The response code indicates whether the username is valid or not. Specifically, a 400 response indicates an invalid username, while a 200 response indicates a valid username.

**Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker does not need a valid session (anonymous access).
