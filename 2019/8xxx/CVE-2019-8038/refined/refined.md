The provided document is a security bulletin from Adobe that includes CVE-2019-8038.

Here's the information regarding CVE-2019-8038:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Use After Free

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a Use-After-Free. This occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, which could lead to corruption of data or arbitrary code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The document doesn't specify the attack vector, but Use-After-Free vulnerabilities are often triggered through crafted input files or specific user interactions within the affected application (Adobe Acrobat and Reader in this case).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted file or trigger a specific interaction that will cause the application to access freed memory. This implies that the attacker needs some form of access to the targeted machine, typically through social engineering (e.g., sending a malicious PDF to the target) or by being able to upload a specially crafted document to a system that uses the vulnerable software.
