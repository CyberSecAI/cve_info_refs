Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-8927:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the `scheduleConfig.jsp` file. Specifically, multiple GET parameters are vulnerable to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user credentials
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Defacing the web page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL with malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a user of the application.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges, just access to a web browser.

**Vulnerable Parameters:**
- The following GET parameters in `/netflow/jspui/scheduleConfig.jsp` are vulnerable:
    - `devSrc`
    - `emailId`
    - `excWeekModify`
    - `filterFlag`
    - `getFilter`
    - `mailReport`
    - `mset`
    - `popup`
    - `rep_schedule`
    - `rep_Type`
    - `schDesc`
    - `schName`
    - `schSource`
    - `selectDeviceDone`
    - `task`
    - `val10`
    - `val11`
