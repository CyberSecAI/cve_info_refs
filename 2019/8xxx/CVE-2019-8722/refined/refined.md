- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple issues in ld64, the linker component in the Xcode toolchains, were addressed by updating to version ld64-507.4. Specifically, the vulnerability arises from compiling code without proper input validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation in the ld64 component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution with user privileges.
- **Attack vectors:**  Compiling code with malicious inputs that are not properly validated by the ld64 linker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to supply crafted inputs that are processed by the vulnerable ld64 tool during the compilation process.
