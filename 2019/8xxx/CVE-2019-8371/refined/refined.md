Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-8371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of administrative users to modify files within the OpenEMR application's web root through the "Administration File Management" functionality. This allows the injection of malicious PHP code into files, specifically custom letter templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** The application does not properly restrict the type of files that can be uploaded, allowing for the upload of PHP files.
*   **Arbitrary Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CWE-94):** By uploading a PHP web shell, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute commands on the underlying server with the privileges of the web server user (www-data in the example).
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive patient information stored within the OpenEMR system is at risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web interface.
*   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file disguised as a legitimate template.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative User Access:** The attacker needs to have administrative privileges within the OpenEMR application to access the file management functionality.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker uploads a PHP web shell (e.g., `custom_pdf.php`) using the file management interface.
*   The attacker then navigates to the uploaded web shell file via browser to execute arbitrary system commands.
*   The provided content includes the HTTP request and PHP code for a basic web shell.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content mentions a related XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-8368), which can also lead to code execution if an administrative user clicks a malicious link.
*   The vulnerable version of OpenEMR is 5.0.1(6). The solution is to upgrade to version 5.0.2 or later.
*   The provided CVSS scores indicate a high severity vulnerability with a base score of 9.0 or 7.2 depending on CVSS version.
*   The EPSS score from cvedetails.com indicates a 0.67% chance of exploitation in the next 30 days.
