Security updates available for ColdFusion | APSB19-47

| Bulletin ID | Date Published | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- |
| APSB19-47 | September 24, 2019 | 2 |

## Summary

Adobe has released security updates for ColdFusion versions 2018 and 2016. These updates resolve two [critical](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) and one [important](https://helpx.adobe.com/security/severity-ratings.html) vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Affected Versions

| **Product** | **Affected Versions** | **Platform** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 4 and earlier versions | All |
| ColdFusion 2016 | Update 11 and earlier versions | All |

## Solution

Adobe categorizes these updates with the following [priority rating](/security/severity-ratings.html) and recommends users update their installations to the newest versions:

| **Product** | **Updated Version** | **Platform** | **Priority rating** | **Availability** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ColdFusion 2018 | Update 5 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/in/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2018-update-5.html) |
| ColdFusion 2016 | Update 12 | All | 2 | [Tech note](https://helpx.adobe.com/coldfusion/kb/coldfusion-2016-update-12.html) |

NOTE:

The security updates referenced in the above Tech Notes require JDK 8u121 or higher (for ColdFusion 2016). Adobe recommends updating your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. Applying the ColdFusion update without a corresponding JDK update will NOT secure the server.  See the relevant Tech Notes for more details.

Adobe recommends customers apply the security configuration settings as outlined on the ColdFusion Security page as well as review the respective Lockdown guides.

* [ColdFusion 2016 Lockdown Guide](https://wwwimages.adobe.com/content/dam/acom/en/products/coldfusion/pdfs/coldfusion-2016-lockdown-guide.pdf)

## ColdFusion JDK Requirement

**COLDFUSION 2018 HF1 and above**

**For Application Servers**

On JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

Apache Tomcat Application Server: edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

WebLogic Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

WildFly/EAP Application Server:  edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation.

**COLDFUSION 2016 HF7 and above**

This security update requires ColdFusion to be on JDK 8u121 or higher.   Adobe recommends that you must manually update your ColdFusion JDK/JRE to the latest version. In case you do not update the JDK/JRE, simply applying the update would NOT secure the server.

**For Application Servers**

Additionally, on JEE installations, set the following JVM flag, "-Djdk.serialFilter= !org.mozilla.\*\*;!com.sun.syndication.\*\*;!org.apache.commons.beanutils.\*\*", in the respective startup file depending on the type of Application Server being used.

For example:

On Apache Tomcat Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘Catalina.bat/sh’ file

On WebLogic Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTIONS in the ‘startWeblogic.cmd’ file

On a WildFly/EAP Application Server, edit JAVA\_OPTS in the ‘standalone.conf’ file

Set the JVM flags on a JEE installation of ColdFusion, not on a standalone installation
