The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MacCms version 8.0, identified as CVE-2019-8410.

- **Root cause of the vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input in the "SEO keywords" field, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code. Specifically, the `{page:key}` function outputs content directly without filtering, and the `/a/tpl/module/db.php` script only sanitizes the `t_name` field, leaving other fields vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that are permanently stored on the server. When a victim views the page, the malicious script is executed in their browser.
- **Attack vectors:** By injecting a payload such as `"/><svg/onload=confirm(1)><` into the "SEO keywords" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Normal user access is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to input data into the "SEO keywords" field, which is then stored and displayed to other users.
