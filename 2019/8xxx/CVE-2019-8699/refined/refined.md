- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue existed in the answering of phone calls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Logic error in phone call handling, specifically related to simultaneous Walkie-Talkie connections.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The initiator of a phone call may be able to cause the recipient to answer a simultaneous Walkie-Talkie connection.
- **Attack vectors**: Initiating a phone call while a Walkie-Talkie connection is active.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to initiate a phone call, and potentially knowledge that the recipient is using Walkie-Talkie.
