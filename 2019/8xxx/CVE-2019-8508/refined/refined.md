- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Kernel's handling of Network File System (NFS) mounts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Mounting a maliciously crafted NFS network share may lead to arbitrary code execution with system privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** Mounting a malicious NFS network share.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to mount a malicious NFS share.
