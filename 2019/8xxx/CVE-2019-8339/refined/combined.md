### @gianlucaborello **[gianlucaborello](/gianlucaborello)** commented [Apr 19, 2019](#issue-435310466) • edited Loading

Working on a feature that's particularly sensitive to event drops and truncated snaplens, I did some performance experiments.

My chosen workload is a sustained busy loop that does nothing more than writing 10KB at a time to /dev/null using `write()`. On my laptop, on a single core I have a throughput of ~1.5M evt/s. Since I am explicitly running with a very high snaplen (65k), this workload would generate a sustained 7 GB/s (!) on a single core inside a ring buffer that could keep up with the consumption. Since our buffer is 8MB, this means that userspace has ~1ms to process all the data inside a ring buffer, before starting to drop. This workload highlighted some potential low hanging fruits that I'll describe here.

To start, this is how the whole thing behaves today, using eBPF (kmod is similar, but with less overhead):

```
Total events (including dropped): 11.3M
Dropped events: 10.6M

```

Pretty bad, we dropped 95% of the events.

Using an off-time CPU analysis methodology this is what I get during a 10s run:

```
$ sudo cpudist -O -m -P -p $(pgrep sysdig) 10 1
Tracing off-CPU time... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

pid = 27973 sysdig

         2 -> 3          : 0        |                                        |

         8 -> 15         : 0        |                                        |

    -                sysdig (31663)
        9824891

```

So, while sysdig was dropping buffers like crazy, it was also leisurely spending the vast majority of its time off CPU (315 \* 30ms ~= 9.8s), as a result of the 30ms sleep we use when we find the buffer empty. This happens because the userspace consumer is not CPU-bound, so it's able to keep up with the producer, and when it catches up it goes to sleep, and during the pause time the producer sends 100s MB of data, overflowing the buffer.

The general approach here is to obviously enlarge the buffer and/or diminish the sleeping time. Diminishing the sleeping time is tricky because it increases CPU utilization, and increasing the ring buffer is tricky because it's a lot of kernel memory wasted on multi core. To absorb a 30ms pause at 7 GB/s the per-core buffer needs to be 200+MB large.

These are the things I experimented with:

* I replaced the fixed 30ms sleep with a simple adaptive algorithm: every time we find the buffer to be empty, we simply double the time we will sleep until we reach a ceiling (30ms). If the buffer is not empty, we reset the sleep threshold so we will start polling more aggressively next time (500us in this PR).
* I removed the logic of "max consecutive wait", since I couldn't find a sense to it: regardless of whether we wait or not, at the end of each period we always refill the buffer and make it available to the caller, so it's not that multiple consecutive waits can cause any harm (that I can see, at least), hence they don't need to be tracked.
* The tail of the buffer was previously advanced when the buffers are refilled, which for any buffer it could potentially be several us/ms after it is consumed since we have to wait for all the buffers to be emptied by userspace, thus keeping the ring buffer needlessly occupied. The tail is now advanced every time we are done completely consuming a buffer. The number of operations should be exactly the same. Admittedly this is a micro optimization, more for readability of the code, so that `check_scap_next_wait` always looks at the new amount of data available, rather than counting the already consumed one, which I found odd.

While this doesn't solve a bursty workload, it does wonders for a sustained workload, as we can see here after the patch for the same stress test:

```
Total events (including dropped): 8M
Dropped events: 60k

```

Not bad at all for a 8MB ring buffer, < 1% dropped (the lower throughput is because now the kernel probe is spending much more time copying all those 10KB into the ring buffer, since it's finding it free).

And the CPU of sysdig remains pretty much the same. In particular, during idle time, the adaptive sleep will always quickly reach the ceiling and stay there (see the relatively minor amount of sleeps under 30ms for the 10s period):

```
$ sudo cpudist -O -m -P -p $(pgrep sysdig) 10 1
Tracing off-CPU time... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

pid = 28645 sysdig

     msecs               : count     distribution
         0 -> 1          : 37       |****                                    |
         2 -> 3          : 11       |*                                       |
         4 -> 7          : 11       |*                                       |
         8 -> 15         : 11       |*                                       |
        16 -> 31         : 317      |****************************************|

```

When we are under sustained workload, the adaptive sleep will always instead be at the floor, allowing us to be very responsive to the sustained load:

```
$ sudo cpudist -O -m -P -p $(pgrep sysdig) 10 1
Tracing off-CPU time... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

pid = 28645 sysdig

     msecs               : count     distribution
         0 -> 1          : 12746    |****************************************|
         2 -> 3          : 0        |                                        |
         4 -> 7          : 1        |                                        |

```

This is rather simple but seems to be doing the job. Ideally I'd like to replace it with a better feedback loop, where the current throughput of the ring buffer is estimated (via timestamps and amounts read over a moving average), and the polling interval is calculated based on that. This way, it would be even more robust with bursty workloads.

Also, a reader might ask why we don't move to a proper I/O multiplexed model using poll(). Unfortunately, it's not obvious that it would help performance, in the past I've done experiments on this and the overhead necessary on the kernel side to maintain the state and wake up the consumer wasn't acceptable even with generous overflow thresholds when you talk about millions of events per second. It's possible that the tests weren't thorough, but that's certainly a much more significant work.

This is just a checkpoint on the experiment, since I'm going to be focusing on something else for a while.

Sorry, something went wrong.

This is rather simple but seems to be doing the job. Ideally I'd like to
replace it with a better feedback loop, where the current throughput of the
ring buffer is estimated (via timestamps and amounts read over a moving
average), and the polling interval is calculated based on that. This way,
it would be even more robust with bursty workloads.

Also, a reader might ask why we don't move to a proper I/O multiplexed
model using poll(). Unfortunately, it's not obvious that it would help
performance, in the past I've done experiments on this and the overhead
necessary on the kernel side to maintain the state and wake up the consumer

thorough, but that's certainly a much more significant work.")`

```
Working on a feature that's particularly sensitive to event drops and
truncated snaplens, I did some performance experiments.

My chosen workload is a sustained busy loop that does nothing more than
writing 10KB at a time to /dev/null using `write()`. On my laptop, on a
single core I have a throughput of ~1.5M evt/s. Since I am explicitly
running with a very high snaplen (65k), this workload would generate a
sustained 7 GB/s (!) on a single core inside a ring buffer that could keep
up with the consumption. Since our buffer is 8MB, this means that userspace
has ~1ms to process all the data inside a ring buffer, before starting to
drop. This workload highlighted some potential low hanging fruits that I'll
describe here.

To start, this is how the whole thing behaves today, using eBPF (kmod is
similar, but with less overhead):

Total events (including dropped): 11.3M
Dropped events: 10.6M

Pretty bad, we dropped 95% of the events.

Using an off-time CPU analysis methodology this is what I get during a 10s
run:

$ sudo cpudist -O -m -P -p $(pgrep sysdig) 10 1

So, while sysdig was dropping buffers like crazy, it was also leisurely
spending the vast majority of its time off CPU (315 * 30ms ~= 9.8s), as a
result of the 30ms sleep we use when we find the buffer empty. This happens
because the userspace consumer is not CPU-bound, so it's able to keep up
with the producer, and when it catches up it goes to sleep, and during the
pause time the producer sends 100s MB of data, overflowing the buffer.

The general approach here is to obviously enlarge the buffer and/or
diminish the sleeping time. Diminishing the sleeping time is tricky because
it increases CPU utilization, and increasing the ring buffer is tricky
because it's a lot of kernel memory wasted on multi core. To absorb a 30ms
pause at 7 GB/s the per-core buffer needs to be 200+MB large.

These are the things I experimented with:

- I replaced the fixed 30ms sleep with a simple adaptive algorithm: every
  time we find the buffer to be empty, we simply double the time we will
  sleep until we reach a ceiling (30ms). If the buffer is not empty, we
  reset the sleep threshold so we will start polling more aggressively next
  time (500us in this PR).

- I removed the logic of "max consecutive wait", since I couldn't find a
  sense to it: regardless of whether we wait or not, at the end of each
  period we always refill the buffer and make it available to the caller,
  so it's not that multiple consecutive waits can cause any harm (that I
  can see, at least), hence they don't need to be tracked.

- The tail of the buffer was previously advanced when the buffers are
  refilled, which for any buffer it could potentially be several us/ms
  after it is consumed since we have to wait for all the buffers to be
  emptied by userspace, thus keeping the ring buffer needlessly occupied.
  The tail is now advanced every time we are done completely consuming a
  buffer. The number of operations should be exactly the same. Admittedly
  this is a micro optimization, more for readability of the code, so that
  `check_scap_next_wait` always looks at the new amount of data available,
  rather than counting the already consumed one, which I found odd.

While this doesn't solve a bursty workload, it does wonders for a sustained
workload, as we can see here after the patch for the same stress test:

Total events (including dropped): 8M
Dropped events: 60k

Not bad at all for a 8MB ring buffer, < 1% dropped (the lower throughput is
because now the kernel probe is spending much more time copying all those
10KB into the ring buffer, since it's finding it free).

And the CPU of sysdig remains pretty much the same. In particular, during
idle time, the adaptive sleep will always quickly reach the ceiling and
stay there (see the relatively minor amount of sleeps under 30ms for the
10s period):

$ sudo cpudist -O -m -P -p $(pgrep sysdig) 10 1

        16 -> 31         : 317      |****************************************|

When we are under sustained workload, the adaptive sleep will always
instead be at the floor, allowing us to be very responsive to the sustained
load:

$ sudo cpudist -O -m -P -p $(pgrep sysdig) 10 1
Tracing off-CPU time... Hit Ctrl-C to end.

pid = 28645 sysdig

     msecs               : count     distribution

In the following blog post we are going to get a closer look at [Falco](https://sysdig.com/opensource/falco/) CVE-2019-8339 vulnerability. Recently, a member of the Falco community privately disclosed a capacity related vulnerability which, under circumstances where a malicious actor has already gained access to your system, could allow the actor to further bypass Falco’s [detection of abnormal activity](https://falco.org/docs/). The final details are still being worked out, but we believe CVE-2019-8339 will be classified as Medium severity according to the [CVSS methodology](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L). We have addressed the vulnerability in version 0.15.0, and this blog post explains the vulnerability and ways to mitigate it in more detail.

Users may want to [upgrade to 0.15.0](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/releases/tag/0.15.0), which provides new ways to detect that Falco’s handling of system call events is being interrupted as a fix for CVE-2019-8339. More importantly, we encourage all users to read our updated documentation to best optimize your deployment. We also want to thank the community for their diligent work in finding and resolving the issue.

## Understanding CVE-2019-8339.

Within the kernel module or eBPF program, we use a buffer that is shared between kernel and user space to store events for processing. This buffer is used to pass information about each system call, including:

* the system call id

* any arguments to the system call

* other useful context including thread/user information

* the result (success/failure)

* any resources created by the system call (new fds, processes, etc).

When a new system call event is processed, the kernel module/eBPF program checks that there is enough space in the buffer for the event. If there isn’t, the event is discarded, a counter that tracks the number of dropped events is incremented, and the kernel module/eBPF program moves on to the next event.

If an attacker already has access to the system where Falco is running, they can run a program that executes a flood of system calls. Along with that flood, the attacker can mix in malicious syscalls which might be dropped by the kernel module/eBPF program and be undetected. This can be executed on both containers and hosts.

The community member also provided a useful proof-of-concept program to demonstrate the vulnerability. The program forked 256 subprocesses per hardware processor. All subprocesses then simultaneously opened 5 files back-to-back in an unrolled loop, where each opened file had a 64k filename. On a 16 core processor, this would be approximately 20k system calls in ~500ms. The number of system calls itself is actually fairly reasonable. Even on lightly loaded machines you can easily expect to see tens of thousands of system calls per second. The real cost is in the 64k filename. A typical open system call event takes ~56 bytes, excluding the filename. Assuming a ~10 character filename, These opens are ~1000x larger than a typical open system call. Converting this to typically-sized system calls, the proof-of-concept program executes ~20 million system calls, all in 500ms!

One way to reduce the risk of dropped system calls is by increasing the size of the shared buffer between user/kernel space. For example, increasing the size of the default kernel buffer from 8mb to 128mb (per cpu) resulted in no dropped system calls, even under the extreme workload used by the proof-of-concept program. However, a determined attacker can always spawn enough processes and threads and use large enough system call arguments to cause system call drops.

The concept of resource starvation and/or memory sizing is not unique to Falco. Here are a few other examples of the same kind of issue:

* Snort Capacity Planning And Buffer Sizing: <http://mikelococo.com/2011/08/snort-capacity-planning/>

* CentOS 6 Backlog limit exceeded error and freeze: <https://www.hungred.com/how-to/backlog-limit-exceeded-error-freeze-centos-6/>

* Improving the Performance of Passive Network Monitoring Applications with Memory Locality Enhancements: <http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/pcap-comcom.pdf>

* Audisp is flooding /var/log/messages (RedHat): <https://access.redhat.com/discussions/2106451>

* Audit buffering and rate limiting: <http://blog.siphos.be/2015/05/audit-buffering-and-rate-limiting/>

* Wazhu Anti-flooding mechanism: <https://documentation.wazuh.com/3.0/user-manual/capabilities/antiflooding.html>

We used these resources to help shape the features we added to Falco to mitigate the CVE-2019-8339 vulnerability. Specifically, we focused on improvements that help identify when Falco is missing system call events and as a result might be under attack by a flood of system calls.

## Detecting dropped system call events (CVE-2019-8339) in Falco.

Even prior to Falco 0.15.0, there are existing mechanisms to detect dropped system call events:

When run with -v (verbose output), at exit Falco will print a summary of the number of system call events handled and processed. Here’s an example:

```
Driver Events:59613
Driver Drops:0
Elapsed time: 0.029, Captured Events: 2417, 83534.94 eps
```

The key metric is the “Driver Drops” count, which should ideally be 0 or very low compared to the number of Driver Events.

When run with -s (stats file), Falco will periodically print statistics on the number of events processed and dropped. Here’s an example:

```
{"sample": 1, "cur": {"events": 12458, "drops": 0, "preemptions": 0}, "delta": {"events": 12458, "drops": 0, "preemptions": 0}, "drop_pct": 0},
{"sample": 2, "cur": {"events": 26145, "drops": 0, "preemptions": 0}, "delta": {"events": 13687, "drops": 0, "preemptions": 0}, "drop_pct": 0},
```

The key metrics are the drops count as well as the drop\_pct value.

## Changes in Falco 0.15.0 to handle dropped system calls to address CVE-2019-8339.

In Falco 0.15.0, we made several changes to how Falco handles dropped system call events to address CVE-2019-8339. The changes were a mix of new features and performance improvements:

* Falco can now take configurable actions such as sending alerts, logging messages, or even exiting falco entirely when it notes that there were dropped system call events. This allows you to more easily detect when there are [dropped events](https://falco.org/docs/event-sources/dropped-events/) and would definitely alert you to an attack of the form described in CVE-2019-8339. There’s a new page on the falco.org site devoted to this feature and its configuration options.

* We made [a change](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1372) to how we read events from the system call buffer to use an adaptive algorithm that reads more frequently when the reader finds a non-empty buffer. This decreases the likelihood of dropped events.

* We started fetching container meta-data [asynchronously](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1326). This, too, reduces the likelihood of dropped events in busy environments with containers being created constantly.

The first change is the most important one, as it provides an explicit signal that denotes dropped system calls without having to monitor the drop rate/stats file separate from Falco. The other changes help reduce the chances of false positives, where dropped events are mistaken as an indicator of an attack.

## Other upcoming changes.

One item on the Falco roadmap is to provide a Prometheus endpoint that exposes metrics on Falco’s operation, including metrics on the number of system calls processed and dropped. This should make it easier to dynamically monitor the behavior of Falco and look for dramatic changes in the number of system calls, which would be a very strong indicator that an attack like this is underway.

We are also going through a security audit for both Falco and sysdig open source. This audit will help us harden the Falco engine, the shared libraries from sysdig, and the underlying kernel interface Falco uses. We’d like to thank the CNCF for contributing to the financial support required for the Falco security audit.

## Conclusion.

We hope this blog post provided useful details on the CVE-2019-8339 vulnerability, the real-world risks, and how to mitigate it in Falco. If you’d like more information, you can always reach us at  [Falco community Slack channel](https://sysdig.slack.com/) or [Github](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco).

# Anti-flooding mechanism

This mechanism is designed to prevent disruptively large bursts of events on an agent from negatively impacting the network or the manager. It uses a leaky bucket queue that collects all generated events, and sends them to the manager at a rate not exceeding a configurable events per second threshold, helping to avoid the loss of events or unexpected
behavior of Wazuh components.

Additionally, agent modules can be configured to limit the rate at which they produce events, reducing the risk of the leaky bucket's buffer being saturated.

* [Why it is an anti-flooding mechanism needed?](#why-it-is-an-anti-flooding-mechanism-needed)
* [How it works: Leaky bucket](#how-it-works-leaky-bucket)
* [Use case: Leaky bucket](#use-case-leaky-bucket)
* [Anti-flooding in agent modules](#anti-flooding-in-agent-modules)

## Why it is an anti-flooding mechanism needed?

In the Wazuh architecture, Wazuh agents collect information from log files, command outputs, different kinds of scans, etc. They then send all the collected information, broken into individual events, to their manager. Without any congestion control, an agent could potentially send events at a rate as high as the system is physically capable of transmitting them (hundreds or thousands per second).

Due to this fact, a wrong configuration in an agent may generate enough events to saturate a network or its manager. Here are some misconfiguration scenarios that could lead to this problem:

* Realtime FIM (Syscheck) of a directory with files that keep changing: Events are generated every time a file under a Syscheck-monitored directory changes. If Syscheck monitors a directory which changes constantly, it will generate a large amount of events. In addition, if the monitored directory contains any file to which Wazuh writes when it generates an event, like `/var/ossec/queue/`, it will cause an infinite loop.
* Windows Filtering Platform: A Windows firewall event (ID 5156) is generated each time an outbound network connection is allowed. When this event is enabled in Windows, and Wazuh is configured to monitor all Windows Security Log events, then when the agent connects its manager, it will generate a Windows firewall event that in turn causes the agent to connect again to its manager, leading to an infinite loop. Thus a disruptively high high rate of events is transmitted by the agent to its manager, causing problems at the agent, network, and/or manager level.
* Applications that retry on errors with no rate limiting: Some applications when encountering poorly anticipated error conditions like disk full, may generate an error log entry and retry over and over again hundreds of times per second, generative a massive event volume.

In order to better handle these kinds of situations, the following controls have been deployed:

* Agent-to-manager anti-flooding mechanism: This provides event congestion control with an agent-side leaky bucket queue to guard against saturation of the network or of the manager by an agent.
* Internal agent anti-flooding control: This mechanism uses internal limits in different components of the agent, making them limit the rate at which they generate events so as to avoid saturation.

## How it works: Leaky bucket

As already described, the leaky bucket is a congestion control located in agents and focused on agent-to-manager communication. It collects events generated on an agent in a buffer of a configurable size (default 5000 events), and sends them to the manager at a rate no higher than a configurable number of events per second (default 500 EPS). These values need to take into account the needs of your specific agents, manager, and network environment. The following graphic shows how the bucket works.

![](../../_images/bucket1.png)

There are several levels of control for the bucket with the aim of being aware of the buffer status, and being able to foresee a flooding situation.

* Warning alert: The first control will trigger an alert on the manager when the occupied capacity of the buffer has reached a certain threshold. By default it is set at 90 percent.
* Full alert: After the first control, if the buffer gets filled, another alert will be triggered on the manager. This new alert is more serious than a warning alert because **a full bucket will drop incoming events**.
* Flood alert: This alert is generated if more than a configurable amount of time passess between a full alert event and the buffer level dropping below the `warning level`.
* Normal alert: This alert is generated to announce that the buffer level has returned to normal (by default <= 70%) after having previously triggered a warning alert or higher.

The leaky bucket is totally configurable to adapt to any environment, with the use of the following configuration options.

### Measured configuration

In the `<client_buffer>` section of [Local configuration](../reference/ossec-conf/index.html) it is possible to disable the buffer, configure the size of the buffer (in number of events), and configure its throughput limit measured in EPS.

* Disable buffer: This parameter disables the use of the leaky bucket, resulting in no restriction on the rate of events transmitted by the agent to the manger. This is how previous versions of the agent worked.
* Queue size: The queue size is the maximum number of events that can be held in the leaky bucket at one time. It should be configured according to the expected rate at which an agent may generate events. This value is set to 5000 events by default, which is a generous buffer size for most environments.
* Events per second: This is the maximum rate at which events will be pulled from the agent's buffer and transmitted to its manager. The default is a generous 500 EPS, but this should be set taking into account the capacity of the network and the number of agents that a manager is serving.

This configuration is also available in [Centralized configuration](../reference/centralized-configuration.html) which means it can be set in `agent.conf` with the aim of configuring agents' bucket options from the manager side. When an agent is configured by `agent.conf`, that configuration overrides its own local configuration.
To allow the agent to have final say about a minimum number of EPS it will be allowed to transmit regardless of the EPS limit handed to it from the manager via agent.conf, another variable called `agent.min_eps` can be set in the agent's [Internal configuration](../reference/internal-options.html).

### Threshold configuration

In [Internal configuration](../reference/internal-options.html), there are more advanced options related to buffer operation. Specifically, the warning and normal level thresholds, plus the tolerance time for triggering a flooding alert can be configured.

## Use case: Leaky bucket

In this section, it will be shown how the leaky bucket acts facing an extreme situation. For this purpose, the following graphic shows different phases of the buffer's usage when it is receiving more events than expected, and how it acts step by step to manage the situation.

![](../../_images/graphic_with_flood1.png)
### Normal status (green area)

As the graphic shows in the left area, the buffer is working normally, receiving and sending events. In this situation no buffer alerts are triggered on the manager. However, a large amount of events can provoke an increase in the buffer usage, causing it to reach the `warning level`, here set at 90 percent.

### Warning status (orange area)

Once it has reached the `warning level`, an alert like this one is triggered on the manager side:

```
** Alert 1501604235.59814: - wazuh,agent_flooding,
2017 Aug 01 18:17:15 (fedora) any->ossec-agent
Rule: 202 (level 7) -> 'Agent buffer queue is 90% full.'
wazuh: Agent buffer: '90%'.
level: 90%

```

Despite this alert, **no events have been dropped** because there is still **free space** in the buffer.

### Reached 100% (light red area)

When the buffer continues receiving events faster than they are removed, it will eventually reach 100% of its capacity, triggering another alert on the manager:

```
** Alert 1501604236.60027: - wazuh,agent_flooding,
2017 Aug 01 18:17:16 (fedora) any->ossec-agent
Rule: 203 (level 9) -> 'Agent event queue is full. Events may be lost.'
wazuh: Agent buffer: 'full'.
level: full

```

It is important to understand that when the buffer is full, all newly arriving events **will be dropped** until free space opens up in the buffer again. For example, if in one second, 1000 events arrive to a full buffer with a throughput limit of 500 EPS, 500 of these events will be stored and the other 500 **will be dropped**.

When the buffer reaches 100% full, a timer is started, which is compared to the `tolerance time` set in `internal_options.conf`.
At this point, two possible things could happen:

* Usage of the buffer decreases to below the `warning level` before the timer reaches the `tolerance time` Consequently, no alert about flooding appears on the manager. The graphic illustrates this situation.

![](../../_images/graphic_without_flooding1.png)

* Buffer usage stays above the `warning level` until the tolerance time has elapsed. Now it appears that the buffer may not come back to a normal status by itself. For that reason, a more severe alert is triggered on the manager.

### Flooding status (red area)

As already mentioned, a severe alert is triggered when `tolerance time` has elapsed. This alert has the following appearance:

```
** Alert 1501604250.60248: mail  - wazuh,agent_flooding,
2017 Aug 01 18:17:30 (fedora) any->ossec-agent
Rule: 204 (level 12) -> 'Agent event queue is flooded. Check the agent configuration.'
wazuh: Agent buffer: 'flooded'.
level: flooded

```

Warning

Note the alert description warns the user to check the agent since it is probable that it will not recover to a normal status by itself.
Remember that **a flooded agent is surely dropping events**.

### Returning to normal status

The right area of the graphic shows how the buffer returns to a normal status after it hits 100% full. This could happen because a module ceases generating excessive events, either because something has completed or because the offending module was shut down manually.

In order to let the manager know when an agent is working properly again, another alert is triggered when a maxed-out buffer's usage decreases back down to less than the `normal level` (70% by default). The alert looks like this:

```
** Alert 1501604257.60486: - wazuh,agent_flooding,
2017 Aug 01 18:17:37 (fedora) any->ossec-agent
Rule: 205 (level 3) -> 'Agent event queue is back to normal load.'
wazuh: Agent buffer: 'normal'.
level: normal

```

When the bucket is in this status **no events are dropped**.

## Anti-flooding in agent modules

In order to avoid agent buffer saturation followed by event loss, the event production rates of Wazuh agent daemons that could cause this saturation have been limited.

* Logcollector: If a log file is written faster that logcollector can read it, this can cause the agent trouble. For this reason, the agent will restrict itself to reading no more than a configurable maximum number of lines from the same file per read cycle.
* OpenSCAP Wodle: This module previously sent the entire set of scan results as soon as a scan would complete. Now it sends the scan information to the manager at a regulated speed so as to reduce the likelihood of maxing out the buffer.

These are advanced configurations located at [Internal configuration](../reference/internal-options.html). The variables defined for this purpose are called `logcollector.max_lines` and
`wazuh_modules.max_eps`. Be careful when changing these values.

### @mstemm **[mstemm](/mstemm)** commented [Mar 13, 2019](#issue-420284265) • edited by mfdii Loading

For more information on this PR, read our blog post on [CVE-2019-8339](https://sysdig.com/blog/cve-2019-8339-falco-vulnerability/).

Changes to monitor for dropped system calls/kernel buffer exhaustion and take configurable actions when this occurs.

Certainly related to and might be a fix for [#545](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/545).

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Monitor syscall event drops + optional actions](/falcosecurity/falco/pull/561/commits/b5a9982997aa010f05a6dc965da682162db3b754 "Monitor syscall event drops + optional actions

Start actively monitoring the kernel buffer for syscall event drops,
which are visible in scap_stats.n_drops, and add the ability
to take actions when events are dropped. The -v (verbose) and
-s (stats filename) arguments also print out information on dropped
events, but they were only printed/logged without any actions.

In falco config you can specify one or more of the following actions to
take when falco notes system call drops:

 - ignore (do nothing)
 - log a critical message
 - emit an \"internal\" falco alert. It looks like any other alert with a
   time, \"rule\", message, and output fields but is not related to any
   rule in falco_rules.yaml/other rules files.
 - exit falco (the idea being that the restart would be monitored
   elsewhere).

A new module syscall_event_drop_mgr is called for every event and
collects scap stats every second. If in the prior second there were
drops, perform_actions() handles the actions.

To prevent potential flooding in high drop rate environments, actions
are goverened by a token bucket with a rate of 1 actions per 30 seconds,
with a max burst of 10 seconds. We might tune this later based on
experience in busy environments.

This might be considered a fix for
https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/545. It doesn't
specifically flag falco rules alerts when there are drops, but does
make it easier to notice when there are drops.")`

# Threat Detection Built on Falco

At Sysdig we believe the future of security is open. It’s how we got started, and with Falco, it’s at the heart of our platform.

[![Falco Graduated CNCF 2024](https://sysdig.com/wp-content/uploads/falco-graduated-cncf-2024.svg)](https://sysdig.com/blog/falco-cncf-graduation/)

[## Falco graduates as a Cloud Native Computing Foundation Project

With over 130 million downloads, Falco is the leader in threat detection.

Follow our Journey](https://sysdig.com/blog/falco-cncf-graduation/)

## Our Vision

---

The cloud brings flexibility and dynamism to modern application development; but it poses new challenges for security. That's why we created Falco, the open source solution for threat detection in hosts, containers, and the cloud.

Years before anyone learned how to pronounce Kubernetes, we set the course for container and cloud threat detection, and ensured it was built on an open source platform.

We built on a heritage of detection and forensics. Twenty years ago, we created [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/), now an indispensable part of every network engineer's toolkit. Ten years ago, we saw the coming change in computing architectures, and how a similar approach was essential for observing what was happening in hosts and containers.

[Falco](https://falco.org/) is based on a unique technical vision, informed by deep experience, and now underpins everything we do. Our products have Falco at their core, delivering detection and runtime insights that power a suite of security solutions.

## Open Source

---

Why did we choose to open source our platform? To be effective, the capability to observe workloads needs to be everywhere. We started with the tool that named our company, [sysdig](https://github.com/draios/sysdig), and grew it into a mature solution for threat detection, Falco, now homed at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/projects/falco/) (CNCF). As a CNCF graduated project, Falco sits at the same level as Kubernetes, a hallmark of broad adoption and dependability.

Modern platforms are built on an open source stack, and we knew that delivering effective security requires an open source solution. [Runtime security must be broadly](https://sysdig.com/blog/sysdig-contributes-falco-kernel-ebpf-cncf/) available in order to meet the challenges of modern infrastructure and threat vectors, and that happens best when it’s an integrated part of the stack: from hosts, to containers and Kubernetes.

## Falco Feedsby Sysdig

---

Falco is the standard for runtime threat detection in the cloud. But default Falco rules must be tuned and validated to accurately detect insecure behavior and evolving security threats. [Falco Feeds by Sysdigextends the power of Falco by giving open source-focused companies access to expert-written rules that are continuously updated as new threats are discovered. Backed by the [Sysdig Threat Research Team (TRT)](https://sysdig.com/threat-research/), a dedicated group of threat researchers on the leading edge of emerging cloud risks and vulnerabilities, Falco Feeds by Sysdig ensures you always have the latest defenses in place.](https://www.sysdig.com/opensource/falco-feeds)

[GET OPEN SOURCE SECURITY AT ENTERPRISE SCALE](https://www.sysdig.com/opensource/falco-feeds)

## It's Not Just Us

---

Falco is used for threat detection by big tech and startups alike, across every major cloud platform, and in large on-premise installations.

Falco is an industry supported solution, delivering on a visionary approach of real time streaming detection. Battle-tested on Linux and Kubernetes, it’s also at the cutting edge of cloud security use cases, able to extend detection to platforms and services such as AWS CloudTrail or GitHub. And, thanks to the CNCF’s stewardship, Falco is a long-term dependable choice—supported not just by us, but by contributors from companies such as IBM, Red Hat, and Apple.

Security is a broad and ever-changing problem: open source allows the industry to pool its collective expertise to meet the growing threats.

Falco is the de facto security solution. By using Falco, we knew we were adopting a standard for cloud and container runtime security. Being able to tap into the Falco open source community, and documentation was extremely helpful.

Cloud Native Runtime Security
## What is Falco?

Falco is a cloud native security tool that provides runtime security across hosts, containers, Kubernetes, and cloud environments. It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and potential security threats in real-time.

At its core, Falco is a monitoring and detection agent that observes events (such as [Linux kernel events](event-sources/kernel) and other data sources through <plugins>) and delivers real-time alerts based on custom rules. Falco also enhances these events by integrating contextual metadata from container runtimes and Kubernetes. The generated alert events can be forwarded to other components to take action or be analyzed in SIEM or data lake systems for further investigation.

Falco, originally created by [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com), is now a graduate [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) project used in production by various [organisations](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md).

## What does Falco do?

Falco uses syscalls to monitor a system's activity, by:

* Parsing the Linux syscalls from the kernel at runtime
* Asserting the stream against a powerful rules engine
* Alerting when a rule is violated

For more information, see Falco [Rules](rules).

Falco's monitoring capabilities are not limited to syscalls as it can be extended via <plugins> to ingest data from many more types of sources.

## What does Falco check for?

Falco ships with a default set of rules that check the kernel for unusual behavior such as:

* Privilege escalation using privileged containers
* Namespace changes using tools like `setns`
* Read/Writes to well-known directories such as `/etc`, `/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`, etc
* Creating symlinks
* Ownership and Mode changes
* Unexpected network connections or socket mutations
* Spawned processes using `execve`
* Executing shell binaries such as `sh`, `bash`, `csh`, `zsh`, etc
* Executing SSH binaries such as `ssh`, `scp`, `sftp`, etc
* Mutating Linux `coreutils` executables
* Mutating login binaries
* Mutating `shadowutil` or `passwd` executables such as `shadowconfig`, `pwck`, `chpasswd`, `getpasswd`, `change`, `useradd`, `etc`, and others.

## What are Falco rules?

Rules are the conditions under which an alert should be generated. A rule is accompanied by a descriptive output string sent with the alert. They are defined using YAML files and loaded by the Falco configuration file. For more information about writing, managing, and deploying rules, see Falco [Rules](rules).

## What are Falco alerts?

Alerts are configurable downstream actions that can be as simple as logging to `stdout` or as complex as delivering a [gRPC](/docs/grpc/ "gRPC is a modern open source, high-performance Remote Procedure Call (RPC) framework.") call to a client. For more information about configuring, understanding, and developing alerts, see [Falco Alerts](alerts). Falco can send alerts to:

* Standard Output
* A file
* Syslog
* A spawned program
* A HTTP[s] end point
* A client through the gRPC API

## What are the Components of Falco?

Falco is composed of several main components:

* Userspace program - is the CLI tool `falco` that you can use to interact with Falco. The userspace program handles signals, parses information from a Falco driver, and sends alerts.
* Configuration - defines how Falco is run, what rules to assert, and how to perform alerts. For more information, see [Configuration](configuration).
* Driver - is a software that adheres to the Falco driver specification and sends a stream of kernel events. Currently, Falco supports the following drivers:

  + (Default) Modern eBPF probe (CO-RE paradigm and more)
  + Legacy eBPF probe built
  + Kernel module

  For more information, see [Falco Drivers](event-sources/drivers).
* Plugins - allow to extend the functionality of Falco by adding new event sources and new fields that can extract information from events. For more information, see [Plugins](plugins).
* [Falcoctl](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl) - allows to easily install rules and plugins and perform administrative tasks with Falco. It is bundled together with Falco.

## What are the ecosystem projects that can interact with Falco?

Apart from the [Falco core projects](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution#core), the Falco organization also maintains and distributes ecosystem projects that help adopters get the most out of Falco. To learn more, visit the [Falco Evolution repositories](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/#repositories) list. For example, the [falcosidekick](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcosidekick) project makes it easier to output Falco events to many applications and channels, [falcoctl](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl) makes it easier to perform a number of administrative tasks for Falco, including installing and updating rules and plugins, while the [falco-exporter](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco-exporter) tool is used to integrate Falco with Prometheus.

[Falco](https://falco.org/) is a cloud native runtime security tool for Linux operating systems. It is designed to detect and alert on abnormal behavior and potential security threats in real-time.

At its core, Falco is a kernel monitoring and detection agent that observes events, such as syscalls, based on custom rules. Falco can enhance these events by integrating metadata from the container runtime and Kubernetes. The collected events can be analyzed off-host in SIEM or data lake systems.

Falco, originally created by [Sysdig](https://sysdig.com), is a **graduated project** under the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io) (CNCF) used in production by various [organisations](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/ADOPTERS.md).

For detailed technical information and insights into the cyber threats that Falco can detect, visit the official [Falco](https://falco.org/) website.

For comprehensive information on the latest updates and changes to the project, please refer to the [Change Log](/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md). Additionally, we have documented the [Release Process](/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/RELEASE.md) for delivering new versions of Falco.

## Falco Repo: Powering the Core of The Falco Project

This is the main Falco repository which contains the source code for building the Falco binary. By utilizing its [libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) and the [falco.yaml](/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/falco.yaml) configuration file, this repository forms the foundation of Falco's functionality. The Falco repository is closely interconnected with the following *core* repositories:

* [falcosecurity/libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs): Falco's libraries are key to its fundamental operations, making up the greater portion of the source code of the Falco binary and providing essential features such as kernel drivers.
* [falcosecurity/rules](https://github.com/falcosecurity/rules): Contains the official ruleset for Falco, providing pre-defined detection rules for various security threats and abnormal behaviors.
* [falcosecurity/plugins](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/): Falco plugins facilitate integration with external services, expand Falco's capabilities beyond syscalls and container events, and are designed to evolve with specialized functionality in future releases.
* [falcosecurity/falcoctl](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falcoctl): Command-line utility for managing and interacting with Falco.

For more information, visit the official hub of The Falco Project: [falcosecurity/evolution](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution). It provides valuable insights and information about the project's repositories.

## Getting Started with Falco

Carefully review and follow the [Official Documentation](https://falco.org/docs/install-operate/).

Considerations and guidance for Falco adopters:

1. Understand dependencies: Assess the environment where you'll run Falco and consider kernel versions and architectures.
2. Define threat detection objectives: Clearly identify the threats you want to detect and evaluate Falco's strengths and limitations.
3. Consider performance and cost: Assess compute performance overhead and align with system administrators or SREs. Budget accordingly.
4. Choose build and customization approach: Decide between the open source Falco build or creating a custom build pipeline. Customize the build and deployment process as necessary, including incorporating unique tests or approaches, to ensure a resilient deployment with fast deployment cycles.
5. Integrate with output destinations: Integrate Falco with SIEM, data lake systems, or other preferred output destinations to establish a robust foundation for comprehensive data analysis and enable effective incident response workflows.

### Demo Environment

A demo environment is provided via a docker-compose file that can be started on a docker host which includes falco, falcosidekick, falcosidekick-ui and its required redis database. For more information see the [docker-compose section](/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/docker/docker-compose)

## Testing

Expand Testing Instructions

Falco's [Build Falco from source](https://falco.org/docs/install-operate/source/) is the go-to resource to understand how to build Falco from source. In addition, the [falcosecurity/libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs) repository offers additional valuable information about tests and debugging of Falco's underlying libraries and kernel drivers.

Here's an example of a `cmake` command that will enable everything you need for all unit tests of this repository:

```
cmake \
-DUSE_BUNDLED_DEPS=ON \
-DBUILD_LIBSCAP_GVISOR=ON \
-DBUILD_BPF=ON \
-DBUILD_DRIVER=ON \
-DBUILD_FALCO_MODERN_BPF=ON \
-DCREATE_TEST_TARGETS=ON \
-DBUILD_FALCO_UNIT_TESTS=ON ..;
```

Build and run the unit test suite:

```
nproc=$(grep processor /proc/cpuinfo | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $3}');
make -j$(($nproc-1)) falco_unit_tests;
# Run the tests
sudo ./unit_tests/falco_unit_tests;
```

Optionally, build the driver of your choice and test run the Falco binary to perform manual tests.

Lastly, The Falco Project has moved its Falco regression tests to [falcosecurity/testing](https://github.com/falcosecurity/testing).

## Why is Falco in C++ rather than Go or {language}?

Expand Information

1. The first lines of code at the base of Falco were written some time ago, where Go didn't yet have the same level of maturity and adoption as today.
2. The Falco execution model is sequential and mono-thread due to the statefulness requirements of the tool, and so most of the concurrency-related selling points of the Go runtime would not be leveraged at all.
3. The Falco code deals with very low-level programming in many places (e.g. some headers are shared with the eBPF probe and the Kernel module), and we all know that interfacing Go with C is possible but brings tons of complexity and tradeoffs to the table.
4. As a security tool meant to consume a crazy high throughput of events per second, Falco needs to squeeze performance in all hot paths at runtime and requires deep control on memory allocation, which the Go runtime can't provide (there's also garbage collection involved).
5. Although Go didn't suit the engineering requirements of the core of Falco, we still thought that it could be a good candidate for writing Falco extensions through the plugin system. This is the main reason we gave special attention and high priority to the development of the plugin-sdk-go.
6. Go is not a requirement for having statically-linked binaries. In fact, we provide fully-static Falco builds since few years. The only issue with those is that the plugin system can't be supported with the current dynamic library model we currently have.
7. The plugin system has been envisioned to support multiple languages, so on our end maintaining a C-compatible codebase is the best strategy to ensure maximum cross-language compatibility.
8. In general, plugins have GLIBC requirements/dependencies because they have low-level C bindings required for dynamic loading. A potential solution for the future could be to also support plugin to be statically-linked at compilation time and so released as bundled in the Falco binary. Although no work started yet in this direction, this would solve most issues you reported and would provide a totally-static binary too. Of course, this would not be compatible with dynamic loading anymore, but it may be a viable solution for our static-build flavor of Falco.
9. Memory safety is definitely a concern and we try our best to keep an high level of quality even though C++ is quite error prone. For instance, we try to use smart pointers whenever possible, we build the libraries with an address sanitizer in our CI, we run Falco through Valgrind before each release, and have ways to stress-test it to detect performance regressions or weird memory usage (e.g. <https://github.com/falcosecurity/event-generator>). On top of that, we also have third parties auditing the codebase by time to time. None of this make a perfect safety standpoint of course, but we try to maximize our odds. Go would definitely make our life easier from this perspective, however the tradeoffs never made it worth it so far due to the points above.
10. The C++ codebase of falcosecurity/libs, which is at the core of Falco, is quite large and complex. Porting all that code to another language would be a major effort requiring lots of development resource and with an high chance of failure and regression. As such, our approach so far has been to choose refactors and code polishing instead, up until we'll reach an optimal level of stability, quality, and modularity, on that portion of code. This would allow further developments to be smoother and more feasibile in the future.

Released 2019-05-13

## Major Changes

* **Actions and alerts for dropped events**: Falco can now take actions, including sending alerts/logging messages, and/or even exiting Falco, when it detects dropped system call events. [[#561](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/561)] [[#571](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/571)]
* **Support for Containerd/CRI-O**: Falco now supports containerd/cri-o containers. [[#585](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/585)] [[#591](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/591)] [[#599](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/599)] [[#sysdig/1376](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1376)] [[#sysdig/1310](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1310)]
* **Perform docker metadata fetches asynchronously**: When new containers are discovered, fetch metadata about the container asynchronously, which should significantly reduce the likelihood of dropped system call events. [[#sysdig/1326](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1326)] [[#550](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/550)] [[#570](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/570)]
* Better syscall event performance: improve algorithm for reading system call events from kernel module to handle busy event streams [[#sysdig/1372](https://github.com/draios/sysdig/pull/1372)]
* HTTP Output: Falco can now send alerts to http endpoints directly without having to use curl. [[#523](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/523)]
* Move Kubernetes Response Engine to own repo: The Kubernetes Response Engine is now in its [own github repository](https://github.com/falcosecurity/kubernetes-response-engine). [[#539](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/539)]
* Updated Puppet Module: An all-new puppet module compatible with puppet 4 with a smoother installation process and updated package links. [[#537](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/537)] [[#543](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/543)] [[#546](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/546)]
* RHEL-based falco image: Provide dockerfiles that use RHEL 7 as the base image instead of debian:unstable. [[#544](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/544)]

## Minor Changes

* ISO-8601 Timestamps: Add the ability to write timestamps in ISO-8601 w/ UTC, and use this format by default when running falco in a container [[#518](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/518)]
* Docker-based builder/tester: You can now build Falco using the [falco-builder](https://falco.org/docs/source/#build-using-falco-builder-container) docker image, and run regression tests using the [falco-tester](https://falco.org/docs/source/#test-using-falco-tester-container) docker image. [[#522](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/522)] [[#584](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/584)]
* Several small docs changes to improve clarity and readibility [[#524](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/524)] [[#540](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/540)] [[#541](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/541)] [[#542](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/542)]
* Add instructions on how to enable K8s Audit Logging for kops [[#535](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/535)]
* Add a "stale issue" bot that marks and eventually closes old issues with no activity [[#548](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/548)]
* Improvements to sample K8s daemonset/service/etc files [[#562](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/562)]

## Bug Fixes

* Fix regression that broke json output [[#581](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/581)]
* Fix errors when building via docker from MacOS [[#582](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/582)]

## Rule Changes

* **Tag rules using Mitre Attack Framework**: Add tags for all relevant rules linking them to the [MITRE Attack Framework](https://attack.mitre.org). We have an associated [blog post](https://sysdig.com/blog/mitre-attck-framework-for-container-runtime-security-with-sysdig-falco/). [[#575](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/575)] [[#578](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/578)]
* New rules for additional use cases: New rules `Schedule Cron Jobs`, `Update Package Repository`, `Remove Bulk Data from Disk`, `Set Setuid or Setgid bit`, `Detect bash history deletion`, `Create Hidden Files or Directories` look for additional common follow-on activity you might see from an attacker. [[#578](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/578)] [[#580](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/580)]
* Allow docker's "exe" (usually part of docker save/load) to write to many filesystem locations [[#552](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/552)]
* Let puppet write below /etc [[#563](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/563)
* Add new `user_known_write_root_conditions`, `user_known_non_sudo_setuid_conditions`, and `user_known_write_monitored_dir_conditions` macros to allow those rules to be easily customized in user rules files [[#563](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/563)] [[#566](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/566)]
* Better coverage and exceptions for rancher [[#559](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/559)]
* Allow prometheus to write to its conf directory under etc [[#564](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/564)]
* Better coverage and exceptions for openshift/related tools [[#567](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/567)] [[#573](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/573)]
* Better coverage for cassandra/kubelet/kops to reduce FPs [[#551](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/551)]
* Better coverage for docker, openscap to reduce FPs [[#573](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/573)]
* Better coverage for fluentd/jboss to reduce FPs [[#590](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/590)]
* Add `ash` (Alpine Linux-related shell) as a shell binary [[#597](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/pull/597)]
