{
  "CVE-2019-8323": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response may output the API response to stdout as it is. Therefore, if the API side modifies the response, escape sequence injection may occur.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `Gem::GemcutterUtilities#with_response` method outputs the API response to stdout without proper sanitization or escaping.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Escape sequence injection"
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary escape sequences into the output, potentially leading to terminal manipulation, information disclosure, or other unintended behaviors.",
      "attack_vector": "Network",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the API response of a RubyGems server that is contacted by a vulnerable client. No authentication is needed."
