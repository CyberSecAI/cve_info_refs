Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-8445

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in several worklog REST resources in Atlassian Jira. This allows unauthorized users to access worklog details.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization (CWE-862):** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks before granting access to worklog information via the REST API.
- **Information Disclosure:** Authenticated users can view worklog details for issues they do not have permission to access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Information Access:** Attackers can gain access to worklog details they are not intended to see. This could include time spent on tasks, descriptions of work performed, and potentially other sensitive information related to the worklog.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **REST API endpoints:** The vulnerability is exposed through specific REST API endpoints:
    - `/rest/api/2/worklog/list`: Allows viewing details of worklog entries.
    - `/rest/api/2/worklog/updated`: Allows obtaining a list of worklog IDs.
- **HTTP POST request:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to these API endpoints with specific worklog IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a valid session on the Jira instance.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jira server and be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Versions Affected:**
- Atlassian Jira versions before 7.13.7 and from 8.0.0 before 8.3.2. Specifically, the Talos report lists 7.6.4 and 8.1.0 as tested vulnerable versions, while the Atlassian Jira ticket lists the affected versions as 7.13.0, 8.2.1.

**Patched Versions:**
- Fixed in Jira versions 7.13.9, 8.3.2, and 8.4.0.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Taylor of Cisco ASIG.
- The CVSSv3 score for this vulnerability is 4.3 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N), indicating a low impact on confidentiality.
- The Atlassian Jira ticket also has labels such as `bugbounty`, `cisco-talos`, `cvss-medium`, `improper-authorization`, and `security`, further confirming this is a security issue.
