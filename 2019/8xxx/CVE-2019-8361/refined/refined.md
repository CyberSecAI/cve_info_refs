Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2019-8361:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper input sanitization in the search functionality of the "Responsive Video News Script" by PHP Scripts Mall. The application does not properly neutralize special characters, allowing injection of malicious HTML code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- HTML Injection: The application allows users to inject arbitrary HTML code into the webpage via the search bar.
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): While the primary demonstration is HTML injection leading to redirection, the injected HTML can contain Javascript, allowing a reflected XSS attack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- URL redirection: Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites by injecting HTML that includes redirecting links.
- XSS: The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or further exploitation.
- Defacement: Injection of HTML could lead to the defacement of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is the search bar of the application. The attacker inputs malicious HTML into the search bar.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable web application, specifically the search functionality.
- No special privileges are needed, as the injection occurs through a standard user input field.
