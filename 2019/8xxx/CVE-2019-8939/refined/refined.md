- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of user-provided input, specifically usernames, within the Tautulli application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization or encoding.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an administrator's browser when they visit the history page. This could lead to data exfiltration, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can change their Plex username to include malicious JavaScript code. When Tautulli retrieves and displays this username on the history page, the script is executed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a Plex user whose username is retrieved and displayed by Tautulli, and the admin has to visit the history page to trigger the XSS.
