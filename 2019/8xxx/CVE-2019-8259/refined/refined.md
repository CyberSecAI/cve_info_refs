Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-8259:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by multiple memory leaks in the UltraVNC client code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper initialization (CWE-665) leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can read stack memory, leading to information disclosure.
- Combined with other vulnerabilities, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access to the affected systems.
- Successful exploitation requires a user to connect to an attacker's server (for the UltraVNC viewer).
- Exploitable remotely (for affected Siemens products).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system.
- Low attack complexity.
- No user interaction is required for the Siemens products.
- User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability in UltraVNC Viewer directly.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in UltraVNC Viewer before version 1.2.2.4.
- Siemens products using affected UltraVNC versions are also vulnerable: SINUMERIK and SIMATIC HMI/WinCC products.
- The vulnerability is present in both VNC client and server code.
- Patches have been released by both UltraVNC and Siemens.
