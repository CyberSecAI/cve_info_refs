- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from the lack of a signal indicating that an executable stack is not required in SwiftNIO SSL. This likely means that a stack marked as executable allowed arbitrary code execution.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is related to a missing security measure related to executable stack management. The absence of the signal allows the stack to be treated as executable, which opens a path to potential arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within a SwiftNIO application using TLS.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector would involve triggering a condition where the application uses the TLS stack in a way that leads to the execution of malicious code on the improperly marked stack. This would likely involve a crafted input or manipulation of the data flow within the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have the ability to interact with the SwiftNIO application using TLS and to send crafted data or perform specific operations that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the stack.
