Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-8062:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to "Insecure Library Loading," also known as DLL hijacking. This occurs when an application loads a malicious DLL (Dynamic Link Library) instead of the intended legitimate one.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading (DLL Hijacking):** The application does not properly validate the location or integrity of the DLL files it loads, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs from an attacker-controlled location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The document explicitly mentions that the vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation. This means an attacker might be able to gain higher levels of access on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to place a malicious DLL with the same name as one of the application's required DLLs in a location where the application will search for it before the legitimate location.
*   The application, when launched, would then load the attacker's DLL instead of the intended one.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs write access to a location where the application will search for DLL files, such as a directory in the DLL search path before the legitimate location
*   **Ability to Create and Rename Files:** The attacker needs the capability to create malicious DLLs and place them in a vulnerable directory.
*   **User Interaction (Likely):**  The user would likely need to launch the vulnerable application for the exploit to execute.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Product:** Adobe After Effects CC 2019 versions 16 and earlier on Windows.
*   **Severity:**  Classified as "Important" by Adobe.
*   **Mitigation:**  Adobe recommends updating to version 16.1.2 or later.
