{
  "CVE-2019-8921": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of a SVC_ATTR_REQ by the SDP implementation of BlueZ. By crafting a malicious CSTATE, it is possible to trick the server into returning more bytes than the buffer actually holds.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of the Continuation State (CSTATE) in the SDP protocol.",
       "The server does not validate the CSTATE data received from the client, leading to an information leak."
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause an information leak by manipulating the cstate data, allowing them to read arbitrary heap data. It can also lead to a denial of service by crashing the bluetooth application.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attacker sends a crafted SDP attribute request with a manipulated cstate",
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "The attacker needs to be able to establish a Bluetooth connection to the target device.",
        "The attacker must be able to send L2CAP packets to the target, meaning they are within Bluetooth range."
     ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability is caused by an integer underflow when calculating how many bytes should be sent to the client, due to not checking if the cstate length is smaller than the cached length."
