GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and
monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-8259

UltraVNC revision 1198 contains multiple memory leaks in VNC client code, which could allow an
attacker to read stack memory and can be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another
vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This vulnerability appears to be
exploitable via network connectivity. These vulnerabilities have been ﬁxed in revision 1199.

SUMMARY

SINAMICS medium voltage products, with Sm@rtServer enabled on SIMATIC comfort HMI Panels, are
affected by multiple vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker, under certain conditions, to gain full remote
access to the HMI. Note that by default Sm@rtServer is disabled, but it can be enabled by the system
integrator on request.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products, and recommends to update them to the latest
version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to port 5900/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

• Disable Sm@rtServer in the SIMATIC HMI Comfort Panels system component of SINAMICS. If this
is not possible, Defense-in-Depth should be used. Note: By default Sm@rtServer is disabled, but it
can be enabled on request by the system integrator

• Follow SINAMICS MV Industrial Security guidelines

• For any questions regarding update, please contact Siemens customer service or your system

integrator.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

The SINAMICS medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety of medium voltage
converters or inverters in different applications.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
