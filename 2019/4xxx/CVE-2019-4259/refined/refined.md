- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sensitive data could be included with service snaps due to the enabled protocol access methods (SMB, NFS) bundled within the CES stack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Exposure of sensitive data within service snapshots.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Sensitive data could be inadvertently sent to IBM during service engagements.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered when creating service snapshots with protocol access methods enabled in the CES stack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** This vulnerability does not require any specific attacker capabilities or position. It occurs when a user is creating service snaps.
