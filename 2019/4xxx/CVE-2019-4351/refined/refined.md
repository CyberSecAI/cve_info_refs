- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Maximo Anywhere application stores usernames as directory names in local storage to store user-specific attachments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Sensitive information (usernames) is stored in local storage in an insecure manner, potentially allowing unauthorized access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of usernames, which could be used to gain more access to the system
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the device's file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker requires physical access to the device or access to the device file system if it is compromised.
