- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Server may disclose the database restore password when using the `dsmserv restore db` command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Password disclosure vulnerability. The server reveals the password used to protect the database backup.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Another user could perform a database restore or potentially replace the database with an old backup.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when using the `dsmserv restore db` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to execute the `dsmserv restore db` command.
