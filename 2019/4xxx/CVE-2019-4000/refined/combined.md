# Druva inSync Client Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[â View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

#### CVE-2019-3999: Druva inSync Client inSyncCPHwnet64.exe RPC Request Type 5 Unauthenticated OS Command Injection - Local Privilege Escalation (Windows)

The Windows Druva inSync Client Service (inSyncCPHwnet64.exe) contains a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited by a local, unauthenticated attacker to execute OS commands with SYSTEM privileges.

When processing RPC type 5 requests over TCP port 6064, inSyncCPHwnet64.exe does not properly validate request data prior to passing it to the CreateProcessW() function. By sending a crafted RPC request, an attacker
can elevate privileges to SYSTEM.

#### Proof of Concept

[See github](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/druva/inSync/druva_win_cphwnet64.py)

Below is a hexdump of the request sent to exploit this vulnerability and execute the command "net user /add tenable"

And here is the corresponding log entry in inSyncCPH.log showing a successful exploitation attempt. Notice that the command 'net user /add tenable' was executed.

```

```
#### CVE-2019-4000: Druva inSync Client inSyncDecommission daemon.set\_file\_acl Authenticated Python Code Injection (Mac OS)

The inSyncDecommission process is susceptible to Python code injection via the RPC service available over TCP port 6059. Specifically, the daemon.set\_file\_acl method passes unvalidated input to the Python eval() function. This vulnerability can be exploited by a local, authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary Python code with root privileges.

After decompiling the daemon\_set\_file\_acl function, we believe the function source code to be as follows. Notice the acl argument is passed to eval() without validation:

```

def daemon_set_file_acl(unknown, fname, acl, user_uid, user_gid):
    try:
        (mode, uid, gid) = eval(acl)	#  unsafe call to eval()

        if not stat.S_ISLNK(mode):
            os.chmod(fname, mode)

        if uid:
            os.lchown(fname, user_uid, user_gid)
        else:
            os.lchown(fname, uid, gid)
    except Exception as fault:
        SyncLog.error('Could not set acl on file %s, error: %s', fname, str(fault))
        SyncLog.dtraceback(fault)
        raise

    return None

```
#### Proof of Concept

[See github](https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/druva/inSync/insync_rpc_set_acl_auth_exploit.py)

And here is a sample invocation of the PoC. Notice that ROOT\_OWNED was created, and it's owned by root.:

```

scooby$ ls -l /private/tmp
total 0

scooby$ python insync_rpc_set_acl_auth_exploit.py 7u0ipcrhaudqbchfptnx "os.system('touch /tmp/ROOT_OWNED')"

scooby$ ls -l /private/tmp
total 0
-rw-r--r--  1 root   wheel       0 Dec 27 11:15 ROOT_OWNED

```
#### CVE-2019-4001: Electron App Command Line Argument Misconfiguration

The inSync Electron application is configured in such a way that a malicious local user can execute arbitrary NodeJS code in the context of the
inSync client process. An attacker can accomplish this by launching inSync with a URL parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled HTML file containing
NodeJS code.

Please note that this file can point to a remote location as well (e.g. http://12.34.56.78/index.html).

Also, note that this vulnerability may be used to read service tokens from the MacOS keychain, and subsequently, it may be exploited in combination with CVE-2019-4000 to escalate privileges to root.

Below I have pasted a vulnerable code snippet in main.js. Notice how the command line argument value is assigned to inSyncURL without any validation. This allows the
Electron application to execute any specified file.

```

if (os.platform() == 'darwin') {
        if (process.argv[3] == "no_rfs") {// TODO launch if no param has been given
            inSyncURL = process.argv[1]
            windowType = process.argv[2]
        } else {
            inSyncURL = process.argv[2]
            windowType = process.argv[3]
        }
    } else {
        if(process.argv[1] == null) {
            var child = spawn(path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', '..', 'inSyncAgent.exe'), ['configure'], {detached: true});
            app.quit()
            return
        }

        inSyncURL= process.argv[1]
        windowType = process.argv[2]
    }

```
##### Proof of Concept

```

(Mac OS)
open /Applications/Druva\ inSync.app/Contents/Resources/inSync.app --args "file:///Users/myuser/index.html" main no_rfs

(Windows)
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Druva\inSync\electron\inSyncClient\inSync.exe" file://C:/Users/myuser/index.html main no_rfs

```
