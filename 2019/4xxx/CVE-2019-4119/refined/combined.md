To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"
* **Did you search for an IBM acquired or sold product ?** If so, follow the appropriate link below to find the content you need.

# Security Bulletin: Multiple Security Vulnerabilities affect IBM Cloud Private Kubernetes

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Multiple Security Vulnerabilities affect IBM Cloud Private Kubernetes

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4119](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4119)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-9946](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9946)

**DESCRIPTION:** Kubernetes could provide weaker than expected security, caused by an interaction when paired with the embedded CNI (Container Networking Interface) that uses the portmap plugin. The portmap plugin inserts rules at the front of the iptables nat chains which would take precedence over the KUBE- SERVICES chain. The HostPort/portmap rule allows for matching of incoming traffic even if there are better fitting.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/158803> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-1002100](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1002100)

**DESCRIPTION:** The Kubernetes API server is vulnerable to a denial of service. By sending a specially crafted patch of type "json-patch" requests, a remote authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to consume an excessive amount of resources.

CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/157685> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-1002101](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-1002101)

**DESCRIPTION:** Kubernetes could allow a remote attacker to traverse directories on the system, caused by the improper handling of symlinks. By persuading a victim to use the kubectl cp command or the oc cp command with a malicious container, an attacker could replace or delete arbitrary files on the host machine.

CVSS Base Score: 6.5

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/158804> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-11243](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11243)

**DESCRIPTION:** Kubernetes could allow a remote attacker to bypass security restrictions, caused by the failure to effectively clear service account credentials loaded using rest.InClusterConfig() by the rest.AnonymousClientConfig() method. By sending a specially-crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to send the loaded service account token with requests.

CVSS Base Score: 5.3

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/160040> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined
