{
  "CVE-2019-4119": {
    "root_cause": "Interaction between Kubernetes and the embedded CNI using the portmap plugin.",
    "weaknesses": "The portmap plugin inserts rules at the front of the iptables nat chains, taking precedence over the KUBE-SERVICES chain. This allows matching of incoming traffic even if there are better fitting rules.",
    "impact": "Weaker than expected security. Potentially allows traffic to bypass intended rules.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based attack.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No special capabilities or access required."
  }
