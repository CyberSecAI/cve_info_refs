- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application can be induced to perform server-side DNS lookups of arbitrary domain names.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to server-side DNS lookups.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can induce the application to perform server-side DNS lookups of arbitrary domain names.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send requests to the application to induce the server-side DNS lookups.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable IBM application.
