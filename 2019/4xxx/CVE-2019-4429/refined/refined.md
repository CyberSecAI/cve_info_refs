- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw in IBM Maximo Asset Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially inject malicious scripts into the application, which could be executed in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, defacement, and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through a cross-site scripting vulnerability. The specific attack vector details, like the vulnerable input field or parameter, are not provided in this document.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to inject malicious scripts into the application. The specific details about the attacker's position or capability are not provided in the document, other than the ability to perform the injection.
