- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to verbose error data being returned in unauthenticated HTTP requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to excessive details in error messages accessible via HTTP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially gain access to sensitive information through error messages.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthenticated HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable system.
