Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-4173:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A flaw in the handling of the HTTP OPTIONS method, also known as Optionsbleed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how the HTTP OPTIONS method is handled by IBM Cognos Controller.
- The vulnerability can expose sensitive information due to insufficient access controls on data in process memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote attacker can potentially read secret data from process memory.
- The attacker can obtain sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends an OPTIONS HTTP request to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable IBM Cognos Controller instance.
- The attacker requires some level of access to the server, as indicated by the "Low" Privilege Required (PR:L) vector in the CVSS score. This may indicate that the attacker might need a valid, albeit low-privileged user account, to execute the attack.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is specific to IBM Cognos Controller 10.4.
- The vulnerability is referenced as "Optionsbleed".
