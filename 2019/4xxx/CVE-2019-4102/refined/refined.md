- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Db2 does not explicitly forbid the use of the 3DES cipher when configured to use TLS 1.2 protocol. While Db2 does not choose the cipher, it doesn't actively prevent the use of weaker ciphers like 3DES when specified in the SSL_CIPHERSPECS list.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the lack of explicit prohibition of the 3DES cipher when it's included in the SSL\_CIPHERSPECS configuration, which allows the use of a weaker cipher with known vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation could potentially lead to weakened encryption, potentially exposing sensitive data transmitted over TLS connections.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially exploit this by forcing the use of the 3DES cipher if it is included in the list of allowed ciphers, potentially enabling attacks that are specific to 3DES like Sweet32.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept or manipulate the TLS handshake in order to potentially force the use of the vulnerable 3DES cipher.
