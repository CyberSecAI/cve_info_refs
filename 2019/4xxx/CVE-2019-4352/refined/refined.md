- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Maximo Anywhere applications lack binary obfuscation of source code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of binary obfuscation allows for decompilation of the application's source code.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Decompilation of the application allows for potential reverse engineering and malicious modification of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can decompile the IBM Maximo Anywhere application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs access to the IBM Maximo Anywhere application to perform the decompilation.
