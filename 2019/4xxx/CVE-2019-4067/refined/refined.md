- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Intelligent Operations Center does not enforce strong password policies by default when configured with an LDAP user registry, allowing for the possibility of a brute force attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Weak default password policies, susceptibility to brute-force attacks via HTTP basic authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:** User passwords might be obtained by attackers.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP basic authentication requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the IBM Intelligent Operations Center.
