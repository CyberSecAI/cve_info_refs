- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The system does not properly restrict the number of authentication attempts, leading to a potential vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The document does not explicitly state the impact of exploitation. However, excessive authentication attempts can lead to denial-of-service or credential-stuffing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the authentication mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the capability to attempt multiple authentications. This could potentially be done remotely.
