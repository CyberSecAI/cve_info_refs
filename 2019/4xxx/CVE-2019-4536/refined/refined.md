- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is related to how IBM Db2 Mirror for i handles the Restore User Profile (RSTUSRPRF) command. Specifically, when a RSTUSRPRF operation is performed on an IBM i 7.4 system with Db2 Mirror configured before applying the necessary PTF, it can lead to inconsistencies and privilege escalations during re-sync operations.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Error entries on the Object Tracking List (OTL) for some system user profiles after a re-sync.
    - User profiles restored using RSTUSRPRF may have been given elevated privileges on both the source and target systems during the re-sync processing.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    -  Unauthorized users may gain elevated privileges
    -  Potential inconsistencies in the system due to errors in the OTL.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - Performing a Restore User Profile (RSTUSRPRF) operation on an IBM i 7.4 system with Db2 Mirror configured before applying the required PTF.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs the ability to perform a RSTUSRPRF operation.
    - The target system must be an IBM i 7.4 system with Db2 Mirror configured and not have the necessary PTF applied.
    - The attacker also needs to be able to do a re-sync operation.
