# Security Bulletin: IBM Db2 Mirror for i is affected by CVE-2019-4536

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

IBM Db2 Mirror for i configurations may be subject to this security vulnerability. A PTF for IBM i 7.4 and remediation steps are available.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4536](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4536)

## Affected Products and Versions

IBM i 7.4 with Db2 Mirror for i might be affected.

## Remediation/Fixes

Take the following steps:

1. apply the PTF to IBM i 7.4, and
2. on systems with Db2 Mirror configured, review the scenarios below and take the steps if needed.

The IBM i PTF number is:
**Release 7.4 â€“ SI70767**
<https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/>

If a Restore User Profile (RSTUSRPRF) has been done on an IBM i 7.4 system with Db2 Mirror configured prior to applying the PTF, remediation is required after applying the PTF for the following issues.

Issue #1: After the re-sync, there may be error entries on the Object Tracking List (OTL) for some system user profiles.
Issue #2: User profiles that were restored may have been given elevated privileges on both the source and target systems during the re-sync processing.

Remediation steps for both issues:

1. Delete any user profile error entries on the OTL that contain 'RSTUSRPRF user\_name' in the Description field. Use the GUI to delete the entries.
2. Resume Db2 Mirror using the GUI.
3. Redo the RSTUSRPRF. You **MUST** use the same Save Security Data (SAVSECDTA) media as the original RSTUSRPRF. Do not use a SAVSECDTA media that was created after doing a RSTUSRPRF with Db2 Mirror configured and without the PTF applied.

There is no issue with RSTUSRPRF on a system that does not have Db2 Mirror configured.

***Important note:** IBM recommends that all users running unsupported versions of affected products upgrade to supported and fixed version of affected products.*
