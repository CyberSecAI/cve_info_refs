- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Robotic Process Automation Ignite Cluster Nodes lack authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication mechanisms for cluster nodes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The document doesn't explicitly detail the impact. However, lack of authentication can allow unauthorized access, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not specify the exact attack vectors. However, the vulnerability stems from missing authentication for cluster nodes which might allow unauthenticated network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would likely need to be able to access the network where the affected cluster nodes are located.
