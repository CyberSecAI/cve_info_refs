- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An insecure Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows a malicious user on the client side, with access to the client computer, to run a custom script. This indicates the CSP is not properly configured to prevent execution of arbitrary scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user could potentially execute arbitrary code or scripts in the context of the vulnerable application, likely within the browser of other users with access to the affected IBM Cloud Automation Manager.
- **Attack vectors:** Client-side attack, meaning the attacker needs access to the client machine of a user interacting with the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the client computer of a user who is interacting with the vulnerable IBM Cloud Automation Manager.
