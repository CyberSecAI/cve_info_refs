The provided content is related to CVE-2019-4234.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a weakness in the implementation of the locking feature within the pattern editor of IBM PureApplication System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper locking mechanism in the pattern editor.
- Failure to prevent modification of patterns while they are supposedly locked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can bypass the intended business logic, modifying a pattern that should be locked.
- The attacker can alter the pattern to an unlocked state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- An attacker intercepts subsequent requests related to pattern locking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have low-level privileges (authenticated user).
- The attacker needs the ability to intercept network requests related to pattern management.
