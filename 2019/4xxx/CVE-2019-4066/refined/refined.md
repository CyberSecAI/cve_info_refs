- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a weak user-creation policy within IBM Intelligent Operations Center (IOC). An authenticated user can create new users with malformed user IDs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of user IDs during the creation process, allowing the creation of malformed user IDs that cause issues with user management.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The primary impact is a denial of service (DoS) condition. The created malformed users cannot be deleted through normal application level interfaces, leading to ID management issues. The vulnerability also has the potential for code execution, as implied by the description.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, as an authenticated user interacts with the application to create users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the vulnerable IBM Intelligent Operations Center.
