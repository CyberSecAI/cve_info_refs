# Security Bulletin: IBM® Intelligent Operations Center has a weak user-creation policy (CVE-2019-4066)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

An authenticated user can create users with malformed user IDs in IBM® Intelligent Operations Center so that these new users cannot be deleted later from the system. Because the malformed users cannot be deleted at the application level, this is a denial of service issue.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4066](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4066)

**DESCRIPTION:** IBM Intelligent Operations Center (IOC) could allow an authenticated user to create arbitrary users which could cause ID management issues and result in code execution.

CVSS Base Score: 8.8

CVSS Temporal Score: See <https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/157011> for the current score

CVSS Environmental Score\*: Undefined

CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

## Affected Products and Versions

This vulnerability affects the following products and versions:
