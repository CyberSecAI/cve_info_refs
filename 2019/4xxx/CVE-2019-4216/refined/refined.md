- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the HTTP Host header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP header injection, specifically abusing the HTTP Host header.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially inject malicious content, redirect users to malicious sites, or conduct other attacks that rely on manipulating the Host header. The specific impact would depend on how the application uses the Host header.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited via manipulation of the HTTP Host header during an HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the HTTP Host header.
