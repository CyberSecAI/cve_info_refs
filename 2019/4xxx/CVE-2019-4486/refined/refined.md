- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the context of a user's session, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, session hijacking, and unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the web UI, which gets executed when another user accesses the compromised content.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must have the ability to input data into the affected application, and the victim must be a user that accesses the malicious input using the vulnerable web interface.
