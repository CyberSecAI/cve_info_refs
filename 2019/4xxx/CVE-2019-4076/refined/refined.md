- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code into the Web UI, which can alter intended functionality. This could lead to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Web UI of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition.
