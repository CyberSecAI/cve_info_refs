- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization in the web UI, allowing users to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser. This can allow attackers to alter intended functionality, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered through the Web UI by injecting JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the Web UI. This typically involves finding an input field or another method where un-sanitized data can be stored and rendered by the application.
