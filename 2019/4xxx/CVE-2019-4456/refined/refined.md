- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a denial of service. The specially crafted XML payload can cause the ViewONE service to become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Payload:** The attack vector is through a malicious XML payload embedded within an HTTP request to the ViewONE service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable ViewONE service.
- **Ability to craft malicious XML:** The attacker must be able to craft a malicious XML payload that includes external entity references.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Daeja ViewONE Virtual versions 5.0 through 5.0.6.
- Fixes are available in specific iFix releases for versions 5.0.5 and 5.0.6.
- The provided content suggests the possibility of other impacts through XXE exploitation, potentially information disclosure, but the provided summary only mentions Denial of Service.
