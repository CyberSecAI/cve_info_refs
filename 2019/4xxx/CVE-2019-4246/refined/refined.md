- **Root cause of vulnerability:** During certain operations, Daeja ViewONE transmits the internal IP address to the client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of internal IP addresses.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially gain information about the internal network infrastructure.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by normal operation of the software when it transmits the internal IP address to the client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be in a position to receive network traffic from the vulnerable Daeja ViewONE Virtual instance to observe the internal IP address.
