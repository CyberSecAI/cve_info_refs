- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale Admin Console is vulnerable to clickjacking.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application lacks proper protection against clickjacking attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can hijack a victim's click actions. This could allow them to potentially launch further attacks against the victim.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can persuade a victim to visit a malicious website, which then hijacks the victim's clicks when they interact with the vulnerable application through an iframe or similar technique.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and convince a victim to visit it.
