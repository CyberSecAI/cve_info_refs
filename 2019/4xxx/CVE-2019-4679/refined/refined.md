- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Content Navigator includes information about the host operating system in the response after the user successfully authenticates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Disclosure of potentially sensitive operating system information in the response to user authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could potentially gain information about the underlying operating system, which could be used in subsequent attacks. The specific impact will depend on the environment.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially trigger the vulnerability by successfully authenticating to the IBM Content Navigator.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the IBM Content Navigator to trigger the vulnerability.
