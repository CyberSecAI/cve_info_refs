- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Access Manager Appliance has a security flaw that allows authenticated users to impersonate other users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User impersonation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can impersonate other users and potentially gain unauthorized access to resources, modify data, or perform actions on behalf of the impersonated user.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to be an authenticated user with network access to the vulnerable appliance. The attacker requires low privileges to perform the attack.
