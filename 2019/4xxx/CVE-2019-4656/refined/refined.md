- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malicious message crafted by an authenticated user can cause a queue manager to incorrectly mark a queue as damaged.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of crafted messages by the queue manager.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service. The queue manager incorrectly marks a queue as damaged, requiring a restart to resume processing against that queue.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted message to the queue manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the IBM MQ or IBM MQ Appliance.
