- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM API Connect Developer Portal is vulnerable to a local file inclusion vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local File Inclusion vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: App developers can download arbitrary files from the host OS and potentially carry out SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited through the IBM API Connect Developer Portal, likely through an improperly validated input allowing access to the file system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an app developer with access to the Developer Portal. User interaction (UI:R) is required, likely to initiate the request for the local file. The attack has a scope change (S:C), which can lead to impacts beyond the direct resource.
