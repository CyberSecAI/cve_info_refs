- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CSV injection vulnerability exists in IBM Maximo Asset Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application is vulnerable to CSV injection. This means that a malicious user could inject specially crafted data into CSV files that, when opened in a spreadsheet program, could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote authenticated attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the system of a user who opens the manipulated CSV file.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application and able to export data in CSV format. The attack vector is through the exported CSV file which contains malicious code. The user opening the exported file will execute the malicious code on their local machine.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the affected application and export data as a CSV file.
