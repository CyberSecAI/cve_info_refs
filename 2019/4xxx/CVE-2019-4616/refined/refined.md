- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IBM Cloud Automation Manager does not set the secure attribute on authorization tokens or session cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure cookie path attribute. The lack of the secure attribute on cookies means that these cookies can be transmitted over insecure channels (HTTP) and can be intercepted by attackers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially intercept authorization tokens and session cookies, leading to session hijacking or unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks where the attacker can intercept HTTP traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server. This is typically achieved by being on the same network or through a man-in-the-middle attack.
