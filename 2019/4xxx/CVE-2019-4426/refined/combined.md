### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Case Builder component shipped in IBM Case Manager is vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI thus altering the intended functionality potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4426](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4426)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| IBM Case Manager | 5.1.1 |
| IBM Case Manager | 5.2.0 |
| IBM Case Manager | 5.2.1 |
| IBM Case Manager | 5.3CD |

## Remediation/Fixes

The recommended solution is to apply the Interim Fix (iFix) or Cumulative Fix (CF) containing APAR [PJ45724](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1PJ45724) as soon as practical:
