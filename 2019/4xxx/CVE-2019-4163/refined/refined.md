- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing function level access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the absence of proper access controls at the function level.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not specified in the provided text, but is related to missing function level access control which could allow unauthorized access and modification.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not specified, but it relates to the exploitation of missing access control mechanisms.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker would require to interact with the affected function due to the missing access control.
