- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malicious user with access to the Db2 instance owner account can leverage a fenced execution process to execute arbitrary code as root. This is due to how Db2 handles the "fenced" user, which is used to run external stored procedures/user defined functions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution with root privileges. The vulnerability exists even if fenced stored procedures are not actively used.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves gaining access to the Db2 instance owner account and then leveraging a fenced execution process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the Db2 instance owner account.
