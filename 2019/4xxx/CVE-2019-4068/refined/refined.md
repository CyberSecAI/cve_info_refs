- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the system's susceptibility to user enumeration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** User enumeration. This weakness allows an attacker to potentially identify valid usernames within the system.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use enumerated user information to brute-force login attempts. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by interacting with the system remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can perform this action remotely. The attacker needs the ability to interact with the system over the network.
