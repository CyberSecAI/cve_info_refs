- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not sanitize all user-controlled inputs, allowing injection of malicious code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary JavaScript code can be embedded in the Web UI, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session and altering intended functionality.
- **Attack vectors:**  Malicious code injection via user-controlled inputs in the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the application to inject the malicious code and a user with a valid session needs to access the injected code.
