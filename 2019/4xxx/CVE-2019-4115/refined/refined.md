- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM WebSphere Extreme Scale Admin API is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and needs a victim to interact with the malicious code (UI:R).
