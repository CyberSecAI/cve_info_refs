- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The password for pattern integrations is stored in the database without proper encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Passwords stored in the database without current encryption mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential unauthorized access and disclosure of sensitive password information.
- **Attack vectors**: Unauthorized access to the database containing the stored passwords.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to access the database where the pattern integration passwords are stored.
