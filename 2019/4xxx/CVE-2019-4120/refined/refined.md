- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts into the application's web pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or the redirection of users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could craft a malicious URL or manipulate input fields to inject the malicious script. When a user clicks the malicious link or submits the crafted input, the script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft and deliver the malicious URL or input to the victim. This can be done through phishing, social engineering, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities. The attacker doesn't need to be on the same network as the victim or have any specific access to the server.
