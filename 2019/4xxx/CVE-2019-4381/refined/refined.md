- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the use of the REST API to interface with the Hardware Management Console (HMC) for advanced node failure detection in IBM i Clustering.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the potential exposure of HMC credentials through the REST API when used for advanced node failure detection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow a local attacker to obtain sensitive information, specifically HMC credentials.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability by interacting with the vulnerable REST API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local to the system. The attack requires low privileges, no user interaction is required, and the security scope is changed.
