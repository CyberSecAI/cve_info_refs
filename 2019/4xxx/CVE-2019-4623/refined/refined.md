- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to altered functionality and credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with the ability to manipulate input fields in the web UI, and induce a victim to trigger the malicious JavaScript code.
