- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error in the IBM MQ AMQP logic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Session fixation vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially hijack a user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability exists in the AMQP listeners of IBM MQ.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to be able to interact with the AMQP listener to perform the session fixation attack. The specific method is not described, but generally, session fixation involves manipulating a user's session identifier.
