- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a missing "Secure" attribute in cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the absence of the "Secure" attribute in cookies used by IBM Security Guardium Big Data Intelligence (SonarG) version 4.0.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The absence of the Secure attribute means that these cookies can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections. This could allow an attacker to intercept the cookie and potentially gain unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack where an attacker intercepts network traffic between the user and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept HTTP traffic between the user and the vulnerable server.
