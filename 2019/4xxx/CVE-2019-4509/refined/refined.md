Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to "incorrect authorization in some components" of IBM QRadar SIEM.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Incorrect authorization allows for unauthorized actions or access within the QRadar SIEM system. This indicates a flaw in how the system verifies user permissions and controls access to its features or data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The specific impact of the vulnerability is not detailed, but incorrect authorization can lead to a range of outcomes, potentially including:
    *   Unauthorized data access or modification
    *   Privilege escalation (an attacker gaining more access than they should)
    *   System compromise
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by malicious users.
    *  Bypassing security controls.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is not specified directly but given that it is an authorization bypass, it would likely involve a user or attacker attempting to exploit the vulnerable components and gain unauthorized access or perform unauthorized actions, likely over network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker would need to have some level of access to the IBM QRadar SIEM system.  Specific required access levels are not listed. However, it is likely an attacker would need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM QRadar versions 7.3.0 to 7.3.2 Patch 4.
*   A fix is available in IBM QRadar/QRM/QVM/QRIF/QNI 7.3.2 Patch 5.
*   IBM recommends that users apply the provided patch to address the vulnerability.
*   The CVSS environment score is mentioned as customer specific, implying that the impact may vary based on specific customer settings and configurations.
