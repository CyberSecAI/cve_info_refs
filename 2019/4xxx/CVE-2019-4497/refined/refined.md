- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering intended functionality and leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code within the JRS web interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low-privileged user with the ability to interact with the web UI can exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is required for the XSS to be executed.
