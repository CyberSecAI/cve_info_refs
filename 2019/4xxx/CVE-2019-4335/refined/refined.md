- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Vulnerability resulting from the location of key file storage in Watson Studio Local.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure key file storage location.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Not explicitly stated but can be inferred that unauthorized access to stored keys would lead to compromised confidentiality and possibly integrity of sensitive data.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly stated, but can be inferred that an attacker with access to the filesystem/server can access the keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to the filesystem or server where Watson Studio Local is installed.
