- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the logging mechanism of the Process Orchestration Web Service within IBM FileNet Content Manager and Case Foundation, which, under specific configurations, may inadvertently include user credentials in the log files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure logging practices leading to exposure of sensitive user information (credentials).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An administrator with access to the local machine where log files are stored can potentially gain unauthorized access to user credentials logged by the Process Orchestration Web Service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local access to the server file system where the log files are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have administrative access to the server where IBM FileNet Content Manager or Case Foundation is running and access to the log files. This is a privileged/local access.
