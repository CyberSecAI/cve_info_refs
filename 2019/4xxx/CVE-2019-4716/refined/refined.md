Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authentication check in the `sv_ProcessUpdateFromCentral()` function (message type `0x1ae`) within the IBM Cognos TM1 / Planning Analytics Application server. This function is intended for updating application data and server variables from a central server in a distributed deployment. However, it can be invoked pre-authentication, allowing unauthorized modification of server configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication for the `sv_ProcessUpdateFromCentral()` function, allowing unauthenticated users to call this function.
*   **Configuration Overwrite:** The function allows overwriting of critical server configuration data, including parameters like `JAVA_HOME` and authentication settings. This overwrite capability is achieved by sending crafted messages to the server. Specifically, the vulnerability involves writing to the tm1s_delta.cfg file.
*   **Path Traversal:** Using path traversal sequences like `../` in the file name allows writing files outside of intended directory, leading to potential code execution.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By manipulating configuration variables (specifically by setting `IntegratedSecurityMode` to 4) and providing a custom CAM server, attackers can bypass standard authentication and impersonate any user, including the administrator.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Using the authenticated admin access, attackers can use the  `sv_ProcessExecuteEx()` function (message type `0xc4`) to execute arbitrary TM1 scripts. The TM1 script can further execute operating system commands through the `ExecuteCommand` function resulting in full server compromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The most significant impact is the ability for an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with root/SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation leads to full control over the affected server, allowing attackers to perform various malicious activities.
*   **Data Modification:** The ability to modify server configuration can also be used to alter data integrity within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is performed over the network by sending specially crafted binary protocol messages to the TM1 Application server using the binary protocol.
*   **Pre-authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable before authentication, making it a significant risk.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the TM1 Application server (direct access or access via a network route).
*   **Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs a good understanding of the TM1 binary protocol to construct the exploit messages.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker requires moderate technical expertise to construct exploits.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects IBM Cognos TM1 versions 10.2.2 and possibly earlier versions as low as 8.x, and IBM Planning Analytics versions up to and including 2.0.8.
*   The vulnerability was patched in IBM Planning Analytics 2.0.9.
*   The advisory mentions that an exploit module is publicly available in Metasploit which automates the exploitation.
*   The vulnerability was reported to IBM by Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security.

In summary, CVE-2019-4716 allows for unauthenticated remote code execution on affected IBM Planning Analytics/Cognos TM1 servers due to a configuration overwrite vulnerability, authentication bypass, and exploitation of TM1 scripting capabilities, leading to complete system compromise.
