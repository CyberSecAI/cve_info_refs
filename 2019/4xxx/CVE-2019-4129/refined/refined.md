Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the potential display of a stack trace in error messages generated by IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core weakness is the exposure of potentially sensitive information through stack traces in error messages. Stack traces can reveal details about the internal workings of the application, potentially including file paths, class names, and other data that could be valuable to an attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential for information disclosure. An attacker who can trigger these error messages might gain insight into the application's architecture, potentially aiding in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves triggering error conditions in the IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center that would cause the application to generate and display stack traces in error messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be in a position where they can interact with the IBM Spectrum Protect Operations Center in a manner that would generate error messages containing the stack traces. This could include:
    - Being a legitimate user who triggers errors through normal usage.
    - Being an attacker who can send crafted requests or manipulate the system to intentionally produce error conditions.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- IBM Spectrum Protect (formerly Tivoli Storage Manager) Operations Center
    - Versions 8.1.0.000 through 8.1.7.xxx
    - Versions 7.1.0.000 through 7.1.9.200
