- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the system allowing a physical user to obtain sensitive information from a previous user of the same machine. This is a Back and Refresh attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system does not properly clear or protect session data when a user logs out, allowing a subsequent user of the same machine to potentially access information from the previous user's session by using the browser's back or refresh functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information of a previous user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed by a physical user of the system who uses the back or refresh button on the browser after the previous user has logged out of the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have physical access to a machine that was recently used to access an affected IBM Maximo Asset Management application, after a previous user has logged out.
