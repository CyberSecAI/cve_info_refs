## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4606](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4606)

## Affected Products and Versions

Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v6.5
Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v6.5.0.0 IF1
Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v6.1
Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v6.1.0.3

Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v6.1.0.1
Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v5.1
Db2 High Performance Unload load for LUW v5.1.0.1

## Remediation/Fixes

HPU have solved the problem in the installer, so that the future releases will not be affected.

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Workaround method:
It is based on updating a Windows registry entry corresponding to the HPU network service.
This registry name is based on the HPU service name which is WinNetServiceXX, where 'XX' is '51', '61' or '65', depending on the HPU version considered.
Here is the registry entry name: HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WinNetServiceXX
Under this entry, its key named 'ImagePath', containing the path of the binary associated to the service, is the one to be updated.
It must be changed by rounding the entire path by double-quotes.
Then, in order to have this change taking effect, the HPU network service must be restarted.
