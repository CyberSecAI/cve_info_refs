- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from an unquoted service path in the IBM Db2 High Performance Unload installer. This means the path to the service executable is not enclosed in double quotes in the Windows registry.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An unquoted service path vulnerability. This occurs because the 'ImagePath' value in the Windows registry for the HPU service lacks double quotes.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious executable with the same name as part of the service's path in a higher-priority directory. When the service starts, Windows will search through the path and execute the malicious file instead of the legitimate one. This could lead to privilege escalation and/or arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the system to exploit this. The attacker would need to place a malicious file in a directory included in the unquoted service path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have write access to a directory in the unquoted path of the service, and the capability to restart or cause a restart of the vulnerable service.
