- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Passwords stored in clear text.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information (passwords) are stored without encryption or hashing, making them easily accessible to unauthorized users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access, data breaches, and compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector is not described, but it would likely involve unauthorized access to the location where the clear text passwords are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need some level of access to the system or its files in order to retrieve the passwords.
