- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper bounds checking in IBM Db2 High Performance Unload when handling the `--credential keystore` option leads to a buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the system with root privileges.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to be able to specify the `--credential keystore` option, potentially through command-line arguments or configuration files, depending on how the application uses the option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be local to the system where Db2 High Performance Unload is installed. No special privileges appear to be required to exploit the vulnerability.
