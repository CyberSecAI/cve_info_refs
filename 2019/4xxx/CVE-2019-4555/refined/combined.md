# Security Bulletin: IBM Cognos Analytics has addressed multiple vulnerabilties

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There are multiple vulnerabilities in IBM® Runtime Environment Java™ Version 8 used by Cognos Analytics. These issues were disclosed as part of the IBM Java SDK updates in October 2017, January 2018, April 2018, July 2018, October 2018, January 2019 and April 2019. Cognos Analytics has addressed the applicable CVEs. Vulnerabilities have been addressed in the following 3rd party software components that are consumed by IBM Cognos Analytics: IBM Websphere Liberty, OpenSSL, Apache HTTP Server, and Microsoft C++ Runtime Library. An XSRF vulnerability in the Cognos Analytics Upload Library and a XSS vulnerability in the Cognos Analytics Upload Visualization functionality have also been addressed.

## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-0734](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0734)

**CVEID:** [CVE-2018-8039](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-8039)

**DESCRIPTION:** It is possible to configure Apache CXF to use the com.sun.net.ssl implementation via 'System.setProperty("java.protocol.handler.pkgs", "com.sun.net.ssl.internal.www.protocol");'. When this system property is set, CXF uses some reflection to try to make the HostnameVerifier work with the old com.sun.net.ssl.HostnameVerifier interface. However, the default HostnameVerifier implementation in CXF does not implement the method in this interface, and an exception is thrown. However, in Apache CXF prior to 3.2.5 and 3.1.16 the exception is caught in the reflection code and not properly propagated. What this means is that if you are using the com.sun.net.ssl stack with CXF, an error with TLS hostname verification will not be thrown, leaving a CXF client subject to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**DESCRIPTION:** Apache HTTP Server, in all releases prior to 2.2.32 and 2.4.25, was liberal in the whitespace accepted from requests and sent in response lines and headers. Accepting these different behaviors represented a security concern when httpd participates in any chain of proxies or interacts with back-end application servers, either through mod\_proxy or using conventional CGI mechanisms, and may result in request smuggling, response splitting and cache pollution.
