- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Db2 binaries load shared libraries from an untrusted path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to the loading of shared libraries from an untrusted path by Db2 binaries. This could allow a low privileged local user to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation to root. A low-privileged local user can gain root access.
- **Attack vectors**: A local attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious shared library in a location that Db2 loads from.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the affected system and the ability to place a malicious shared library in a directory where it could be loaded by Db2.
