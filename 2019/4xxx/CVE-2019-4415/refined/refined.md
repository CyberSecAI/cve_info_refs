- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `icp-scc` SecurityContextConstraints resource in IBM Cloud Private on OpenShift was erroneously assigned to all pods in all namespaces. This occurred regardless of the user ID used to create the resource or the service account assigned to the pod.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incorrect assignment of SecurityContextConstraints, leading to unintended access and privilege escalation for pods.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The `icp-scc` SecurityContextConstraints, designed for specific system components, was inadvertently applied to all pods, potentially allowing unauthorized access or privilege escalation within the cluster.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious actor could potentially exploit this misconfiguration to gain elevated privileges by deploying a pod that leverages the overly permissive SecurityContextConstraints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to deploy pods within the affected IBM Cloud Private on OpenShift environment to take advantage of the vulnerability.
