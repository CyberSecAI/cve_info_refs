## Vulnerability Details

**CVEID:** [CVE-2019-4185](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-4185)

## Affected Products and Versions

The following products, running on all supported platforms, are affected:

        IBM InfoSphere Information Server: version 11.7.1

        IBM InfoSphere Information Server on Cloud: version 11.7.1

## Remediation/Fixes

| ***Product*** | ***VRMF*** | ***APAR*** | ***Remediation/First Fix*** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| InfoSphere Information Server,  Information Server on Cloud | 11.7 | -- | --Apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server version [11.7.1.0](https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10878310 "11.7.1.0")  --Apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server [11.7.1.0 Fix Pack 1](https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/??? "11.7.1.0 Fix Pack 1") |

## Workarounds and Mitigations

Perform the following steps to secure your environment:

1. List your kube-system namespace

     > kubectl get deployments -n kube-system

![image-20190425180554-1](/support/pages/system/files/inline-images/image-20190425180554-1.png)

2. List the pods in your kube-system namespace

      > kubectl get deployments -n kube-system

![image-20190425180646-2](/support/pages/system/files/inline-images/image-20190425180646-2.png)

3. Delete the tiller pod

     >  kubectl delete deployment tiller-deploy --namespace=kube-system

4. Verify that the tiller pod was deleted by examining the output of command

     > kubectl get deployments -n kube-system

Verify that helm is working by executing the following command:

     > helm list

    The output should contain the list of deployed services.

    However, if the following error message is displayed:

         Error: configmaps is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default" cannot list resource "configmaps" in API group "" in the namespace "kube-system"

         Execute the following command:

         > kubectl patch deploy --namespace kube-system tiller-deploy -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"serviceAccount":"tiller"}}}}'

        After 10 to 20 seconds, again check the output of "helm list" as indicated above.

**NOTE**:

After making the above changes, if at a later point in time you need to install a patch, you must deploy the tiller pod before installing the patch. Use the following steps:

1. Deploy tiller

     > /usr/local/bin/helm init

2. Verify that the tiller POD is created by executing the command

     >  kubectl get deployments -n kube-system

     You should see tiller-deploy listed in the output.

3. Install the patch

4. Repeat the steps listed above to again secure your environment.
