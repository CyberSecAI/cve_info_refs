- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect permissions set on IBM MQ installation directories on Microsoft Windows.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Local non-privileged users can exploit these incorrect permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local non-privileged user can execute code as an administrator. This is a privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** A local, non-privileged user must have access to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be a local, non-privileged user on a system where the vulnerable IBM MQ versions are installed.
