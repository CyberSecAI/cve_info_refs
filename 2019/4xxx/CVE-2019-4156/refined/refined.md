- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Security Access Manager Appliance uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or user interaction are required, but the attack is of high complexity.
