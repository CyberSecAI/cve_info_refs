Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Incorrect authorization settings within IBM Maximo Asset Management. Specifically, the `TECHNICIAN` and `SUPERVISOR` templates were incorrectly granting `DELETE` access to the `MXAPIWODETAIL` object structure, which manages work order records.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users, who should not have the ability to delete work order records, could do so due to the overly permissive access granted by the templates.
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The `MXAPIWODETAIL` object structure was not configured with the principle of least privilege in mind.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An authenticated user with access based on the `TECHNICIAN` or `SUPERVISOR` templates could potentially delete work order records, even though they should not have the necessary privileges. This could lead to data loss, disruption of operations, or other negative consequences depending on the criticality of work order data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user in Maximo Asset Management with privileges granted based on the `TECHNICIAN` or `SUPERVISOR` templates.
- The attacker exploits the incorrectly granted `DELETE` access to the `MXAPIWODETAIL` object structure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have valid credentials for an account in IBM Maximo Asset Management that is associated with a security group that is linked to either the `TECHNICIAN` or `SUPERVISOR` template.
- The attacker must have a basic understanding of the application and how to interact with the object structures.

**Additional details:**

- The provided text also includes remediation steps to remove the incorrect access and prevent future occurrences of the vulnerability.
- The fix involves removing the `DELETE` authorization for the `MXAPIWODETAIL` object structure from the `TECHNICIAN` and `SUPERVISOR` templates, as well as any security groups linked to these templates.
- For versions prior to 7.6.1.2, manual database updates are required to remove the incorrect access from the out-of-the-box templates.
