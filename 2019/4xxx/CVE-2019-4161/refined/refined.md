- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Internal data, left over from the product development and Beta phases, was not removed from the initial versions of IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Disclosure of internal data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The disclosed internal data, although mostly specific to ISIQ's development environment, could potentially provide an attacker with information such as the exact HTTP server level which might be useful for reconnaissance and further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: No specific attack vector is mentioned, but it seems the vulnerability is present in the product itself, so exploitation would not necessarily require external access. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned beyond being able to access the vulnerable product and the disclosed internal data.
