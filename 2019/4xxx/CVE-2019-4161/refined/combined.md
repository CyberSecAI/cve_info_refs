# Security Bulletin: IBM Security Information Queue discloses internal data left over from the product development phases

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

The initial versions of IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ) disclose internal data left over from the product development and Beta phases. In most cases, the data is specific to ISIQ's development environment and not useful to an attacker. Some of it, however, such as ISIQ's exact HTTP server level, could be useful. This internal data has been removed as of the 1.0.3 GA version.
