- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The root cause is a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator Standard Edition Web UI.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, potentially altering the intended functionality and leading to credential disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the Web UI where the malicious JavaScript code can be injected.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code, possibly through a user with low privileges, into the vulnerable Web UI. The attacker needs a user to interact with the manipulated interface.
