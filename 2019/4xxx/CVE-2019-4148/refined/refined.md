- **Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- **Root cause:** The application allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Attack vector:** Embedding malicious JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Impact:** Altered intended functionality, potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attacker capabilities:** Requires a user with high privileges (PR:H) to be able to inject the malicious script. A successful attack requires a victim to interact with the injected script (UI:R).
