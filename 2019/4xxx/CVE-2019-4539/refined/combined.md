# Security Bulletin: Multiple security vulnerabilities have been addressed in IBM Security Directory Server

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed and delivered in IBM Security Directory Server.

## Vulnerability Details

CVEID: CVE-2019-4520

CVEID: CVE-2019-4538

DESCRIPTION: IBM Security Directory Server could allow a remote attacker to conduct phishing attacks, using an open redirect attack.
