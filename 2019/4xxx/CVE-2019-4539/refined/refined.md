- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Directory Server does not properly neutralize special elements used in XML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of special elements in XML leading to XML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can modify the syntax, content, or commands of the XML before it is processed by an end system. This could lead to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based attack, requiring a low privileged attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A low privileged attacker is required to exploit this vulnerability via the network.
