**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of a local privileged Informix user to load a malicious shared library within IBM Informix Dynamic Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Library Loading:** The system allows the loading of external, potentially malicious shared libraries.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local user with Informix privileges can exploit this to gain root access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Root Access:** Successful exploitation grants the attacker root privileges on the system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With root access, the attacker has complete control over the system, potentially leading to data theft, modification, or denial-of-service attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Privileged Informix User:** The attacker must have an account with privileges within Informix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local System Access:** Physical or remote access to the target machine is needed.
*   **Informix Privileges:** The attacker must have an existing account with sufficient privileges within Informix to be able to load a shared library.

**Additional Notes:**

* The IBM document provides more detailed technical information about the vulnerability than the CVE description.
*   The vulnerability is present in IBM Informix Dynamic Server versions 12.10.FC1 through 12.10.FC12 on Linux platforms.
*   The fix involves upgrading to version 12.10.FC13
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that none of their products are affected, despite using IBM Informix Dynamic Server.
