{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The module retrieves masthead, site, and available package information from IBM BigFix Relay Servers without proper authentication or authorization checks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure, Unauthorized Access to sensitive information. The module does not require authentication, allowing an attacker to enumerate sensitive information about the BigFix deployment.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain knowledge of the BigFix deployment, including masthead data, site information and available packages. This information can be used to map the organizationâ€™s infrastructure, plan further attacks, and potentially exploit identified vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network-based exploitation by sending specifically crafted requests to the target IBM BigFix Relay server on a known port. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the target IBM BigFix Relay Server."
