**Support for IBM MQ CloudPak versions**
The support lifecycle for IBM MQ CloudPaks is tied directly to the support lifecycle of the IBM MQ version that runs within the CloudPak. When the underlying MQ version goes out of support then the CloudPak will automatically go out of support. IBM MQ CloudPaks are only available with Continous Delivery versions of IBM MQ and so follow the  [IBM MQ Continuous Delivery support lifecycle](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27047919) .

The version number for the CloudPak provides an indication to customers on what kind of change has been made between different versions. The versioning system used in CloudPaks is the  [semver versioning system](https://semver.org/) and does not correlate directly to the  [V.R.M.F version](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27008656) used by IBM MQ.

For reference the table below shows which versions of IBM MQ are available with which version of CloudPak, this can be used to determine whether the version of CloudPak you are using is still in support:

IBM MQ CloudPak and IBM MQ versions
| IBM MQ Version | IBM MQ CloudPak for IBM Cloud Private Version | IBM MQ CloudPak for IBM Cloud Private on RedHat OpenShift Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 9.1.2 | 3.0.0 and later | 2.3.0 and later |
| 9.1.1 | 2.2.0 - 2.2.3 | 2.2.0 - 2.2.2 |
| 9.1.0 | 2.0.0 - 2.1.0 | 2.1.0 |
| 9.0.5 | 1.3.0 | N/A |
| 9.0.4 | 1.2.0 - 1.2.2 | N/A |
| 9.0.3 | 1.0.0 - 1.1.0 | N/A |
