Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues: a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the IBM Engineering Workflow Management (EWM) code itself and a vulnerability present in the included JQuery library (version 1.11.1).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The EWM application has a stored XSS vulnerability in its code. This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application, which will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the affected data or pages.
*   **Vulnerable JQuery Library:** The application uses a vulnerable version of the JQuery library (v1.11.1) that might have known security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware distribution
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Redirection to malicious websites

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **XSS:** Attackers would likely inject malicious script into input fields or other data points within the EWM application. This injection of malicious scripts would be persistent, affecting other users that access the injected data.
*   **JQuery Vulnerability:** Attackers could exploit known vulnerabilities in the JQuery library used by the application. The exact nature of the exploit would depend on the specific vulnerability in the outdated library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the application. This could involve manipulating input fields, modifying data, or exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow for the injection of scripts.
*  **JQuery Vulnerability:** The attacker would need to have some knowledge of vulnerabilities present in JQuery version 1.11.1. The attacker would also need to be able to trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   RTC (Rational Team Concert) versions: 6.0.2, 6.0.6, 6.0.6.1
*   EWM (Engineering Workflow Management) version: 7.0

**Remediation:**

The recommended fix is to upgrade to the following versions or later:
*   EWM 7.0 iFix003 or later
*   RTC 6.0.6.1 iFix011 or later
*   RTC 6.0.6 iFix017 or later
*   RTC 6.0.2 iFix025 or later

**Additional Notes:**
The document also suggests subscribing to IBM's notifications to stay informed about future security bulletins. It also mentions that the CVSS environment score impacts the overall CVSS score.
