- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Planning Analytics Workspace component of IBM Planning Analytics is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF) vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: The security bulletin does not explicitly describe the impact, but XSRF vulnerabilities can allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user without their consent.
- **Attack vectors**: The bulletin specifies XSRF as the attack vector which typically involves tricking a user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website that performs unwanted actions on the targeted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The bulletin does not explicitly describe the required capabilities, but attackers would typically need to lure the victim into interacting with a malicious site or link while the user is authenticated to the vulnerable application.
