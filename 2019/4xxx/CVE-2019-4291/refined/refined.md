- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Maximo Anywhere applications lack binary obfuscation, which allows the source code to be easily decompiled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of binary obfuscation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Decompilation of the application allows access to the source code. The security bulletin does not explicitly state what can be done with this decompiled source code.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could decompile the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would require access to the application and the ability to decompile it.
