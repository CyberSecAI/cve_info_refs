Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4411:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the usage of easily guessable session identifier names within IBM Cognos Controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Predictable Session IDs: The application uses session identifier names that are not sufficiently random, making them vulnerable to guessing attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: An attacker who can guess or predict a valid session identifier can potentially gain access to sensitive information. This access is limited to what the authenticated user associated with the session has access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based: The attacker exploits the vulnerability over the network by attempting to guess valid session IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must be able to authenticate to the IBM Cognos Controller application.
- Network Access: The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application.
- Session ID Guessing: The attacker must be able to guess or predict valid session IDs

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, indicating moderate severity.
- The vulnerability is addressed in specific interim fixes for different versions of IBM Cognos Controller.
-  Specifically, the fixes are included in versions 10.3.0 FP1 IF13, 10.3.1 IF12, 10.4.0 IF5, and 10.4.1 IF2. Older versions do not include a fix.
