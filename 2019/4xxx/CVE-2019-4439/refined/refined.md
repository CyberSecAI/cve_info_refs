- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the session is not invalidated upon logout in IBM Cloud Private.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the failure to invalidate user sessions after logout.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is not explicitly stated in the provided text, but it can be inferred that this could lead to unauthorized access if a previous session is still valid, potentially allowing access to resources they shouldn't have.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the exploitation of a non-invalidated session after a user has logged out.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would require access to a previous user session, likely through hijacking or reusing a session. It's not detailed if the attacker needs to be on the same network, but it is inferred that a stolen/hijacked session is required.
