- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM Platform System Manager in Cloud Pak System allows web pages to be stored locally.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows locally stored web pages to be read by another user on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information or manipulate web pages by accessing locally stored files.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a user on the system.
