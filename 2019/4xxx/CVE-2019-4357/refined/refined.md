- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A redirected restore operation specifying a target path when using Spectrum Protect Plus to protect Oracle, DB2 or MongoDB databases.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Privilege escalation and code injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges or execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attacker specifying a target path during a redirected restore operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local access with high privileges on the system running IBM Spectrum Protect Plus. The attacker needs to be able to initiate restore operations.
