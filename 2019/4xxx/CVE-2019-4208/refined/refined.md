- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the improper processing of XML data, which allows for an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization when parsing XML data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious external entities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information or the consumption of memory resources, potentially causing denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote and involves submitting crafted XML data to the vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send malicious XML data to the IBM TRIRIGA server.
