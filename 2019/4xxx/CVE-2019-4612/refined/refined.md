- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Planning Analytics is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI, altering intended functionality and potentially leading to credentials disclosure within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** Embedding malicious JavaScript code in the web user interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the application's web UI, which typically requires a low level of access (PR:L). The user needs to be tricked to interact with the malicious UI (UI:R) to trigger the attack.
