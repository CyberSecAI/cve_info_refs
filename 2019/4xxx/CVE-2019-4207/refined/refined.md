- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform which allows disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The platform has a vulnerability that could expose sensitive information. This information is only supposed to be accessible to local users but the vulnerability can expose it otherwise.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information that is normally restricted to local users. This information could then be used to carry out further attacks against the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is not specifically stated in the bulletin but the vulnerability could be exploited to gain access to information not supposed to be available to a remote user or attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to exploit a vulnerability to access data which would only be available to a local user.
