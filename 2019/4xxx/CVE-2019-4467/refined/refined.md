- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the IBM Platform System Manager for Cloud Pak System.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS). The system allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code that could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the web application.
    - Potentially disclosing credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code via the Web UI.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low-privileged access (PR:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The attack is performed remotely (AV:N).
