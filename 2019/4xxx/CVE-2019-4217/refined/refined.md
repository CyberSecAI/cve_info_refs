  - Attack vectors: Embedding the ISIQ web application in an iframe on a malicious website.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to create a website and convince a user to visit it.
  - Affected Products and Versions: IBM Security Information Queue v1.0.0, v1.0.1, and v1.0.2
