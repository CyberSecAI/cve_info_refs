- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation in IBM Resilient SOAR platform allows processing of extremely large data in HTTP POST, PUT, or PATCH requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Lack of proper validation on the size of data being submitted in form fields.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A denial-of-service (DoS) of the SOAR Platform.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an HTTP POST, PUT, or PATCH request with an extremely large data in a form field to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the SOAR platform.
