- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls, allowing an authenticated user to view process definitions of a business process without having the necessary permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure due to insufficient access control checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user can gain unauthorized access to view sensitive business process definitions.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based exploitation, where an authenticated user leverages the vulnerability to view information they should not have access to.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
