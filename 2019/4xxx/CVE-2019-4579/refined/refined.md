- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation when handling data in POST, PUT, or PATCH HTTP requests, specifically when a form field contains an extremely large data payload.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input size limits allowing attackers to send extremely large payloads. This leads to a potential Denial of Service.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a denial of service of the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending a POST, PUT, or PATCH HTTP request with an extremely large payload in a form field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the IBM Resilient SOAR Platform.
