- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the incorrect trust in the HTTP Host header within IBM Jazz for Service Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTTP Header Injection
- **Impact of exploitation**: The bulletin does not explicitly state the impact but HTTP header injection can potentially be used to perform various attacks such as Cross-site Scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, or session fixation.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulation of the HTTP Host header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and manipulate the Host header of that request.
