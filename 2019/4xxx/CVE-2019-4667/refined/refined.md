- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of a built-in HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) option in IBM UrbanCode Deploy (UCD).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing HSTS header, which can leave the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Without HSTS, browsers may not enforce HTTPS connections on subsequent visits after an initial secure connection, potentially leading to session hijacking or data exposure if an attacker is able to intercept an insecure connection.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attacks can be performed by intercepting network traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to intercept network traffic between the client and the IBM UrbanCode Deploy server.
