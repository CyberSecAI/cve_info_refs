- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Security Secret Server has an overly permissive CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policy for login.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An overly permissive CORS policy can allow unauthorized access from other origins. This is a type of information leak.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The overly permissive CORS policy could potentially lead to information leaks. The bulletin mentions this as a potential "minor yet significant" issue.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is due to a server misconfiguration that does not properly restrict access based on the origin of a request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to make a request from an unauthorized origin to exploit the overly permissive CORS policy.
