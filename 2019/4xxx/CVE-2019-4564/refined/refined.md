- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the web UI of IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session, which could lead to:
    - Altering the intended functionality of the web UI
    - Potential disclosure of credentials within a trusted session.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the web UI of the affected application
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to embed JavaScript code into the web UI of the vulnerable IBM Security Key Lifecycle Manager. The vulnerability requires user interaction (UI:R).
