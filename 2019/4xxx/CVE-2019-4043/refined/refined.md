- **Root cause of vulnerability**: XML External Entity Injection
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The document doesn't specify the impact beyond identifying the vulnerability type as XXE, but generally, XXE vulnerabilities can lead to disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF), and other attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the XML parsing functionality of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator by injecting malicious XML containing external entity references.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to supply malicious XML to the vulnerable system. Specific details on how this is achieved are not given.
