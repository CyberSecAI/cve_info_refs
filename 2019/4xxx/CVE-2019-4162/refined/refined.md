CVE-2019-4162: IBM Security Information Queue web server allows downgrading to non-secure HTTP

- Root cause of vulnerability: The IBM Security Information Queue (ISIQ) web server defaults to HTTPS but does not enforce it.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The web server does not enforce HTTPS, allowing users to navigate to an unencrypted version of the ISIQ web application.
- Impact of exploitation: Users may connect to an unencrypted version of the web application, potentially exposing their data to interception.
- Attack vectors: An attacker could potentially intercept or manipulate traffic if a user connects to the unencrypted HTTP version of the application.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or manipulate network traffic between the user and the ISIQ web server.
- Affected Products and Versions: IBM Security Information Queue v1.0.0, v1.0.1, and v1.0.2
- Remediation/Fixes: Upgrade to IBM Security Information Queue v1.0.3 or greater.
