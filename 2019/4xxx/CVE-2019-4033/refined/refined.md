Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The application is susceptible to XSS attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: The document does not explicitly detail the impact, but XSS vulnerabilities can typically allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in a victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
*  **Attack Vectors**: The document doesn't detail the specific attack vector, but cross-site scripting typically involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages that are viewed by other users. This could be through user input fields or other means of manipulating the application's output.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious script into the IBM Content Navigator application, which is then executed within a user's session.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3
*   IBM Content Navigator 3.0 Continuous Delivery

**Remediation:**
*   Upgrade IBM Content Navigator 2.0.3 to 2.0.3.8 IF22 or higher
