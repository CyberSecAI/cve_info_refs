- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application is vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code in the Web UI. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirecting users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by embedding malicious JavaScript code within the Web UI. The specific input vector is not detailed, but it likely involves user-controllable inputs that are not properly sanitized or encoded.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject JavaScript code into the web UI, likely requiring user level access with the ability to manipulate certain parts of the application (e.g. input fields, database entries, etc.).
