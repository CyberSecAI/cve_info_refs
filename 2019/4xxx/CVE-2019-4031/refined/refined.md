- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A local user could launch the `taskLauncher` program and create or replace files created by the root user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper privilege management allowing a local user to manipulate files owned by the root user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Privilege escalation, where a local user can gain higher privileges by modifying files owned by the root user.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where IBM Workload Scheduler is running.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local user account on the system where the vulnerable IBM Workload Scheduler is installed.
