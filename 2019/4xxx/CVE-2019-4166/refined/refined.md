- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper host header validation in the IBM StoredIQ Data Server. This allows for potential host header injection attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Host Header Injection vulnerability due to insufficient validation of the Host header.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform actions such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Potentially gaining unauthorized access or control
    - Other malicious activities
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through manipulating the Host header in HTTP requests sent to the StoredIQ Data Server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the StoredIQ Data Server and manipulate the Host header field.
