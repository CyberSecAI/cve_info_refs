- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Robotic Process Automation Credential Vault may leak secrets on the client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability where secrets might be leaked from the credential vault.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Potential exposure of sensitive credentials stored in the vault.
- **Attack vectors:** The document does not specify the attack vector, but it implies that a malicious actor could potentially access secrets through the client application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document doesn't specify required attacker capabilities or position. It is implied that the attacker must have some level of access to the client application.
