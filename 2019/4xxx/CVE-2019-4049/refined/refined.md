- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An error in the error logging functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to consume disk space on the underlying filesystem.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A denial of service attack can occur due to the exhaustion of disk space.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is related to the error logging functionality of IBM MQ, the attack involves exploiting this functionality to consume disk space.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to trigger the error logging function of IBM MQ.
