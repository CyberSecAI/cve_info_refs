- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A command injection vulnerability exists in IBM DataPower Gateway and IBM MQ Appliance.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command injection, allowing execution of arbitrary commands on the system.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A local attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system, potentially leading to complete system compromise (confidentiality, integrity, and availability).
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be local to the system to exploit the vulnerability.
