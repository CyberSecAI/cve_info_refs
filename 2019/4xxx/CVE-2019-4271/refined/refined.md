Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from two issues:
    *   **HTTP Parameter Pollution:** A client-side issue where manipulating HTTP parameters can lead to unintended behavior.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Pollution:** The application is susceptible to manipulation of HTTP parameters, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
*  **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to XSS attacks, which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **HTTP Parameter Pollution:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to various impacts depending on how the application processes the polluted parameters. This is not further detailed in this content.
*   **Cross-site scripting:** Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    *   Steal sensitive user information (e.g., session cookies)
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user
    *   Deface the website
    *   Redirect the user to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is client-side, meaning the attacker would likely need to craft malicious links or web requests.
*   For HTTP parameter pollution, the attacker would manipulate HTTP parameters in the request to the application.
*    For XSS, the attacker would inject malicious scripts into the application, which are then executed in a user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send malicious HTTP requests to the vulnerable WebSphere Application Server Admin Console.
*   For XSS, the attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious scripts that are later displayed to other users of the application.
*   No specific details on the exact location/form the injected parameters or script would take are given in this document.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
*   WebSphere Application Server Version 9.0
*   WebSphere Application Server Version 8.5
*   WebSphere Virtual Enterprise Version 7.0
