- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM QRadar Advisor With Watson App for IBM QRadar SIEM uses weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of weaker than expected cryptographic algorithms
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could decrypt highly sensitive information stored in the app.
- **Attack vectors:** The document does not specify an attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document does not specify attacker capabilities/position.
