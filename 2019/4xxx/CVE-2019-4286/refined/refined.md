- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sensitive information, including usernames, passwords, session tokens, and other cookies, is being disclosed in device/console logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive data in logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive information could be obtained by an attacker who has access to the logs.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with access to the device or console logs could read the disclosed sensitive data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have access to the device/console logs where the sensitive information is being written.
