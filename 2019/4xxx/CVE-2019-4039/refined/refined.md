- Root cause of vulnerability: A vulnerability exists within the error logging function of IBM MQ.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A local attacker could cause an overwrite of arbitrary MQ files.
- Impact of exploitation: This can lead to a denial of service attack against IBM MQ queue managers.
- Attack vectors: A local attacker exploits the error logging function.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be local.
