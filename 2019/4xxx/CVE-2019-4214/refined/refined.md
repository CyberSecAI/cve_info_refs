Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4214:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the failure to set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` attributes in cookies used by IBM Log Analysis.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing HttpOnly Attribute:**  Without the `HttpOnly` attribute, cookies can be accessed by client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript). This exposes the cookies to potential theft through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Missing Secure Attribute:** The absence of the `Secure` attribute means the cookie can be transmitted over unencrypted HTTP connections, potentially exposing the cookie to eavesdropping via man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A remote attacker could potentially intercept the transmission and obtain sensitive information from the cookie in clear text by:
- Stealing the cookie via XSS if the HttpOnly attribute is missing
- Sniffing the cookie during its transmission over unencrypted HTTP connections.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the web application, which could then access and exfiltrate the vulnerable cookies.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** If the cookie is transmitted over an unencrypted HTTP connection (due to the missing `Secure` attribute), an attacker positioned on the network path can intercept the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable server.
- **XSS injection:** An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the web application if they intend to steal the cookie via XSS.
- **Network position:** For MitM attacks, the attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the user and the server.
