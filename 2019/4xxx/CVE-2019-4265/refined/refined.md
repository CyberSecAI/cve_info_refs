- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The IBM Maximo Anywhere application lacks device root detection capabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The absence of device root detection allows attackers to potentially gain sensitive information about the device.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker gaining access to sensitive device information.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited on devices where the IBM Maximo Anywhere application is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have some level of access or control over a device running the affected application to exploit the lack of root detection.
