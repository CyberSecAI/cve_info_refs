- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The IBM Spectrum Protect Backup-Archive Client on HP-UX IA64 does not properly back up Access Control List (ACL) entries associated with files and directories on VxFS HP-UX filesystems.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to back up ACL entries.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Data loss of ACLs during backup and restore operations, leading to potential access control issues or security vulnerabilities when restoring data.
- **Attack vectors:** This is not an exploitable vulnerability; it is a flaw in the backup software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Not applicable, as this is a software flaw, not a vulnerability that can be actively exploited by an attacker.
