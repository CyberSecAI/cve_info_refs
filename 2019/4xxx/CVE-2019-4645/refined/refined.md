Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-4645:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or encoding when handling .xlsx file uploads within the "Assistant Search tab" of IBM Cognos Analytics.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.
- This could potentially lead to:
    - Stealing user session cookies.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted .xlsx file via the "Assistant Search tab."
- The vulnerable software processes the file, and when the contents are displayed, the injected script executes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker does not require any authentication to exploit this vulnerability(PR:N).
- The attacker needs to trick or entice a user to interact with malicious content(UI:R).

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in IBM Cognos Analytics versions 11.1 and 11.0.
- The provided CVSS vector string is: `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N/`
    - **AV:N** (Network): The attack can be launched over a network.
    - **AC:L** (Low): The attack is easily achievable.
    - **PR:N** (None): No privileges are required to launch the attack.
     - **UI:R** (User interaction required): The attacker needs to trick or entice a user to interact with malicious content.
    - **S:C** (Changed): Scope is changed; The vulnerable component can impact other components beyond the vulnerable one.
    - **C:L** (Low): There is limited impact on confidentiality.
    - **I:L** (Low): There is limited impact on integrity.
    - **A:N** (None): There is no impact on availability.
