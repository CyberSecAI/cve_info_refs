## Description

![@whotwagner](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15659571?u=7b0864b3285dd758517d08d19c7689b5bb8c9416&v=4&size=48)[whotwagner](https://github.com/whotwagner)opened [on Jul 18, 2018](https://github.com/remko/phkp/issues/1#issue-342335449)

Hi,

the http-query-string is not sanitized. An attacker could inject a command. Here is an example that gives out the `id`-command:

/pks/lookup?search=someid@example.com;id&op=get

It is possible to place a shell, or open a reverse-shell or exchange gpg-keys or execute other commands
