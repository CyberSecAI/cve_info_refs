Greetings ,

While looking for CVE i decided to pick an open source CMS (content management system) which is Frog CMS can be found here : https://github.com/philippe/FrogCMS .

So i started setting up my localhost with frog CMS. After that i quickly logged into my frog cms account.
And there i saw an option to add "New Snippet" . I click on that and used this payload "><Svg OnLoad=(confirm)(1)> and saved that payload. After that a xss popup appear on my browser.

Thant's all folks

Greetings , This blog is also about my second finding on the Frog CMS , While testing i visited the forgot password page. First i tried some random things for abusing that functionality but i got nothing. After that i entered the following payload "><svg/onload=prompt(1)> and entered. The xss popup started showing on my browser. That's all folks. Please share this blog with everyone.
