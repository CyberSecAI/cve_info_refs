Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The root cause is a lack of input sanitization/validation in the Frog CMS when adding new snippets. The CMS does not properly filter or escape user-provided input, allowing malicious code to be stored and later executed in a user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS. Malicious JavaScript code is stored within the application's database, and is executed when the stored content is accessed by other users or the admin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the CMS, which can be executed in the browsers of other users who visit the affected pages.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By injecting malicious scripts, an attacker can potentially steal session cookies, credentials or other sensitive information of users and administrators.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers could modify the content of pages, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other actions to deface the website.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Snippet Creation:** An attacker, likely with administrative or content creation privileges, can add a new snippet containing the malicious payload.
*   **Page/Content Access:** The malicious script is executed when a user views a page or area where the snippet is rendered by the CMS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Access to CMS Administration:** The attacker needs to have access to the CMS with the capability to create or edit snippets. This likely means needing at least contributor or admin level privileges.
*   **Ability to inject JavaScript:** The attacker needs to be able to input or insert JavaScript code into the vulnerable area (in this case, via the 'New Snippet' functionality).

**Additional details:**

The blog post demonstrates the vulnerability with the following payload: `"><Svg OnLoad=(confirm)(1)>` and `"><svg/onload=prompt(1)>` .  These payloads are injected into the "New Snippet" functionality and then executed when the snippet is rendered, resulting in an XSS popup.
