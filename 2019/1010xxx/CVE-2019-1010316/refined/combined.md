Hi

I have installed pyxtrlock in a fedora laptop, and, when executing it, the browser is displayed with the padlock and i cant do anything on it, great...

But, if i hit any keyboard shortcut, or if i hit the activity bar with the mouse, i can still use the computer as normal. It looks like it only blocks the interaction of the keyboard with the browser

Am i doing something wrong? Is there any config i need to apply?

Thanks
