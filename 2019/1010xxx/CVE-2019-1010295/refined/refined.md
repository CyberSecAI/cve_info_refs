The provided content is a commit diff for a fix related to CVE-2018-0007, not CVE-2019-1010295.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from missing checks on TA (Trusted Application) parameters when a user TA calls a pseudo TA (Trusted Application). Specifically, a user TA could pass invalid pointers to a pseudo TA, leading to potential security issues.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core issue is the lack of validation of memory access rights when transferring parameters between user TAs and pseudo TAs. This allows a malicious user TA to potentially provide invalid memory references.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to memory or cause crashes by passing invalid memory pointers to a pseudo TA. This could potentially lead to information disclosure or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a malicious user TA crafting specific parameters when calling a pseudo TA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to create and execute a malicious user TA and initiate calls to a vulnerable pseudo TA.
