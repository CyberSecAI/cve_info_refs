The provided content describes a vulnerability in ZZCMS version 8.3 that allows for arbitrary file deletion leading to code execution.

*   **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Deletion leading to Code Execution
*   **Root cause:** The `zssave.php` script allows an attacker to specify a file path via the `oldimg` parameter when the `action` parameter is set to "modify". The script then uses `unlink()` to delete the specified file. This can be abused to delete `/install/install.lock`. Subsequently, the `/install/index.php` script can be accessed. This script uses `extract($_GET, EXTR_SKIP)`, which allows an attacker to inject code via the `url` parameter, which is then used in a string replacement within the `/inc/config.php` file, leading to code execution.
*   **Weakness:**
    *   Uncontrolled parameter leading to arbitrary file deletion in `zssave.php`.
    *   Use of `extract($_GET, EXTR_SKIP)` in `/install/index.php`, allowing for variable injection.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution
*   **Attack vector:**
    1.  Send a POST request to `/user/zssave.php` with `action=modify` and `oldimg=../install/install.lock` to delete the installation lock file.
    2.  Access `/install/index.php` with a crafted `url` parameter (e.g., `?url=`);phpinfo();//`) to inject code into `/inc/config.php` and achieve code execution.
*   **Required capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send POST and GET requests to the server. The attacker does not need prior authentication.
