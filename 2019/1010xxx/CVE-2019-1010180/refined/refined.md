{
  "CVE-2019-1010180": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow due to lack of proper validation of ELF section sizes, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Buffer overflow",
        "Out-of-bounds memory access"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service, memory disclosure, and possible code execution.",
      "Attack vectors": "Opening a specially crafted ELF file for debugging.",
        "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to provide the target user with a malformed ELF file."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Incorrect command emitted by GDB to install missing debug info using zypper. Also an outdated whitelist of librpm versions used by GDB.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
        "Incorrect command emission",
        "Outdated library whitelist"
      ],
     "Impact of exploitation": "Users could have difficulty installing missing debug information, leading to a degraded debugging experience. An incorrect version of librpm could cause errors or unexpected behavior in GDB.",
      "Attack vectors": "Copying and pasting the incorrect zypper command provided by GDB, or using a system with a non-compatible librpm version.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"Attacker must be able to cause missing debug info messages to be emitted."
    },

      "Root cause of vulnerability":"Integer overflow that can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow in load_specific_debug_section in objdump.c",

          "Integer overflow",
            "Heap-based buffer overflow"
