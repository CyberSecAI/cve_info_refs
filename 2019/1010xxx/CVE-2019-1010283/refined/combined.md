Bug #48427 UDN: Forbid vulnerable GET\_DN for VERSION >= 3

[Browse files](/univention/univention-corporate-server/tree/a28053045bd2e778c50ed1acaf4e52e1e34f6e34)

```
UDL using PROTOCOL_3 must no longer use GET_DN but WAIT_DN - if it is
still used this is a protocol violation. UDL simply will not get an
answer.

When UCRV 'notifier/protocol/version is set to 3, any old client still
using PROTOCOL_2 will get rejected while negotiating the protocol
version, so it is asserted that "version >= network_procotol_version".
```
