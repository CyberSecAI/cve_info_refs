## Description

![@jna380](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28755775?v=4&size=48)[jna380](https://github.com/jna380)opened [on Dec 29, 2017](https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/issues/763#issue-285090598)

Hello,

it is more a beauty mistake than really harmful, but when logged in as any user, JavaScript code can be executed through "Name", "Location", "Bio" and "Starting Page" fields in the My Account page (see appended picture).

Still the input should be sanitized. It is already prevented by "escape()" of the input in list.js.

Regards,

jna380
