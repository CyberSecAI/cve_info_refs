*   **Location:** "My Account" page in emoncms.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The "Name", "Location", "Bio", and "Starting Page" fields on the "My Account" page.
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of proper sanitization of user input in the mentioned fields. JavaScript code can be injected via these fields.
*   **Mitigation:** Input sanitization is suggested as a preventative measure. The reporter notes that `escape()` is used for input sanitization in `list.js`.
