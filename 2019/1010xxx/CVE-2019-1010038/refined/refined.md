The content is related to CVE-2019-1010038.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the ParModelica component of OpenModelica.
- The vulnerability occurs when the environment variable "OPENMODELICAHOME" is concatenated to a fixed-size buffer (`options` of 100 characters) without sufficient size checks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer overflow due to unbounded string concatenation.

Impact of exploitation:
- By setting the "OPENMODELICAHOME" environment variable to a value larger than what the buffer `options` can hold (around 300+ characters), an attacker can overwrite memory and potentially change the execution flow of the program.
- This can lead to arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
- The attacker needs to control the "OPENMODELICAHOME" environment variable.
- This is typically done through shell interaction.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to set the environment variable for the process running the vulnerable code.
