The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1010297.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in crypto system calls when calculating the size of a buffer to allocate for cryptographic parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The multiplication of `sizeof(TEE_Attribute)` and `param_count` could overflow, resulting in `alloc_size` being smaller than required.
- Heap-based buffer overflow: If an integer overflow occurs, a buffer smaller than expected would be allocated, potentially leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when attacker-controlled data is written beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A heap-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service if attacker-controlled data overwrites memory used by the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered through specific crypto-related system calls within the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment). Attackers would need to manipulate the `param_count` variable passed to these syscalls to trigger the overflow during the buffer size calculation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
Attackers need to be able to make calls to the vulnerable crypto system calls. This likely involves having the ability to interact with the TEE, possibly through a user-space application.
