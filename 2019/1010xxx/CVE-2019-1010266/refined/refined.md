{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2019-1010266",
    "details": "The lodash package before 4.17.11 is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). It parses dates using regex strings, which may cause a slowdown of 2 seconds per 50k characters. This is due to a regular expression that is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.",
    "affected_components": [
      {
        "name": "lodash",
        "version": "<4.17.11"
      }
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a regular expression used to parse dates, which is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking. This occurs when a regex engine has to evaluate a large number of paths due to multiple optional repetitions, leading to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)"
    ],
     "impact": "A successful attack can cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by excessively consuming CPU, making the system inaccessible to legitimate users. Processing time can increase significantly with a crafted input, leading to service slowdown or unavailability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send crafted requests containing long strings designed to trigger the vulnerable regular expression. The attack can be done remotely over the network, without requiring any user interaction or special privileges.",
