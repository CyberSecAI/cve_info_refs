- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Flask previously used the content type of the request to decode incoming JSON bytes, which allowed for the use of non-text related encodings. This could lead to unexpected memory usage.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unvalidated or arbitrary encodings used to parse JSON data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unexpected memory usage through the use of non-text related encodings in the JSON data.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted JSON payload with a non-text related encoding through a POST or similar request to a Flask application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to send HTTP requests to a Flask application endpoint that processes JSON data.
