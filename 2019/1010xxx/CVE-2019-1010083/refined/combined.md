# Flask 1.0 Released

Posted by David Lord on 2018-04-26

---

The Pallets team is pleased to release [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) 1.0.

The Flask framework has been stable for a long time. A little more than 8 years after
the first commit, the version number finally reflects that. 1.0 comes with a significant
number of changes representing over a year of work.

* Dropped support for Python 2.6 and 3.3.
* The CLI is more flexible. `FLASK_APP` can point to an app factory, optionally with
  arguments. It understands import names in more cases where filenames were previously
  used. It automatically detects common filenames, app names, and factory
  names. `FLASK_ENV` describes the environment the app is running in,
  like `development`, and replaces `FLASK_DEBUG` in most
  cases. [See the docs to learn more.](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/page/cli/)
* If python-dotenv is installed, the `flask` CLI will load environment variables
  from `.flaskenv` and `.env` files rather than having to export them in each new
  terminal.
* The development server is multi-threaded by default to handle concurrent requests
  during development.
* `flask.ext`, which was previously deprecated, is completely removed. Import
  extensions by their actual package names.
* Accessing missing keys from `request.form` shows a more helpful error message in
  debug mode, addressing a very common source of confusion for developers.
* Error handlers are looked up by code then exception class, on the blueprint then
  application. This gives more predictable control over handlers, including being able
  to handle `HTTPException`.
* The behavior of `app.logger` has been greatly simplified and should be much easier
  to customize. The logger is always named `flask.app`, it only adds a handler if none
  are registered, and it never removes existing
  handlers. [See the docs to learn more.](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/page/logging/)
* The `test_client` gained a `json` argument for posting JSON data, and
  the `Response` object gained a `get_json` method to decode the data as JSON in
  tests.
* A new `test_cli_runner` is added for testing an app's CLI commands.
* Many documentation sections have been rewritten to improve clarity and relevance. This
  is an ongoing effort.
* The [tutorial](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/page/tutorial/) and
  corresponding [example](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/1.0/examples/tutorial)
  have been rewritten. They use a structured layout and go into more detail about each
  aspect in order to help new users avoid common issues and become comfortable with
  Flask.

There are many more changes throughout the
framework. [Read the full changelog](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/page/changes/) to
understand what changes may affect your code when upgrading.

## JSON Security Fix [¶](#json-security-fix)

Flask previously decoded incoming JSON bytes using the content type of the request.
Although JSON should only be encoded as UTF-8, Flask was more lenient. However, Python
includes non-text related encodings that could result in unexpected memory use by a
request.

Flask will now detect the encoding of incoming JSON data as one of the supported UTF
encodings, and will not allow arbitrary encodings from the request.

## Install or Upgrade [¶](#install-or-upgrade)

Install from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) with pip:

```
pip install -U Flask

```
## Get Involved [¶](#get-involved)

Flask and the Pallets team depends on you, the community. Whether you report issues,
write documentation, create patches, or answer questions, we appreciate all the help you
provide. Check out
the [contributing guide](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.rst) to
get started.

## Donate [¶](#donate)

The Pallets organization has joined the Python Software Foundation's Fiscal Sponsorship
program. We now accept donations through the PSF in order to support our efforts to
maintain the projects and grow the community. [Click here to donate.](../donate)
