  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2019-1010200",
      "root_cause": "The application uses the 'exec' function to execute shell commands based on user-supplied text. The text is sanitized by replacing specific characters with spaces. However, this sanitization is insufficient to prevent command injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient sanitization of user-provided input",
        "Use of the 'exec' function with unsanitized input"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server by injecting malicious code through the 'text' parameter in the '/tts' or '/alignment' endpoints.",
      "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the '/tts' or '/alignment' endpoints, embedding malicious shell commands within the 'text' query parameter.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the server.",
       "additional_info": "The code changes in the commits replace the direct execution of the command with piping the sanitized text to the standard input of the executed process."
