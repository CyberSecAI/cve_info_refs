- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect URL generation that potentially leaks user information.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure, though the specific user information leaked is not detailed.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves the generation of URLs using the incorrect logic, which could be triggered by a `go get` request or through other means involving URL generation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to trigger the URL generation process, such as by attempting to use `go get` to access a repository, or other mechanisms that rely on the incorrect URL generation.

The content suggests that the issue was classified as a security vulnerability and was addressed promptly with a bug fix, backported and merged.
