  "CVE-2019-1010022": {
    "description": "GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass. The impact is: Attacker may bypass stack guard protection. The component is: nptl. The attack vector is: Exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerability and use this bypass vulnerability to bypass stack guard. NOTE: Upstream comments indicate \"this is being treated as a non-security bug and no real threat.\"",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The stack canary protection mechanism in glibc can be bypassed by overwriting the `tcbhead_t.stack_guard` value on the stack, especially when creating new threads with `pthread_create()`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Mitigation bypass",
         "Stack buffer overflow vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can bypass the stack guard protection (stack canary) to exploit a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability.",

        "Exploiting a stack buffer overflow vulnerability",
        "Overwriting the tcbhead_t.stack_guard value on the stack"
