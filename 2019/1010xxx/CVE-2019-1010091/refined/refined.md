{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inappropriate validation of user input during media element creation in TinyMCE.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application does not properly sanitize the user-provided input, allowing the injection of arbitrary JavaScript code through the 'onerror' attribute.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary JavaScript code execution (self-XSS). After the XSS executes, any attempt to edit the malicious media element makes the editor unresponsive.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker can insert malicious JavaScript code into the embed code of a media element through the 'onerror' attribute.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to insert and edit media elements in a TinyMCE editor instance. The attack can be executed by a user who has access to the editor."
