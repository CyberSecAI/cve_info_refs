| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c0)  Ilya Smith    2018-02-16 12:09:45 UTC  ``` When pthread_create'ed thread firstly calls malloc, glibc create a new heap region for it. Size of this heap depends on compile-time configuration and in my case ( x84-64 arch ) HEAP_MAX_SIZE is 64MB  In function malloc/arena.c:new_heap there is a condigion when heap will be aligned by HEAP_MAX_SIZE. This means that address of created heap will be aligned to HEAP_MAX_SIZE what is 64MB in my case.  Now we can compute the probability to guess the heap address by attacker.  2^48 - 4096 is size of user-mode task. 64MB is 2^26 that means there is 48-26=22, 2^22 possible heaps in the application. For many Linux distributives mmap_rnd_bits is 28 (tunable with /proc/sys/vm/mmap_rnd_bits ). It means for such systems 8 hi-bits would be set - 48 bits - (mmap_rnd_bits + PAGE_SHIFT) = 8, this means we know 8 hi bits of mmap_base address - it will be started from 0x7f. What does it means? it means that if application create thread and call malloc from new thread, it is 2^14 possible values for such heap.  Proof of Concept:  first get program that outputs malloc addr:  #include <pthread.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <errno.h> #include <sys/mman.h>  void * first(void *x) {        int a = (int)x;        int *p_a = &a;  	void *ptr;        ptr = malloc(8);        if (ptr == 0)        {                printf("Failed to alloc %d\n", errno);                return -1;        } 	printf("%p\n", ptr);        return 0; }  int main() {        int res;        pthread_t one;         res = pthread_create(&one, NULL, &first, 0);        if (res)        {                printf("Failed create thread %d\n", errno);                return -1;        }        void *val;        pthread_join(one,&val);        return 0; }  now execute it many times and get histogram with python:  import subprocess  d = {} i = 0 while i < 1000000:    output = subprocess.check_output('./thread_stack_heap_hysto')    key = int(output, 16)    if key in d:        d[key] += 1    else:        d[key] = 1    i += 1 print 'total: ', len(d) for key in d:    print hex(key), d[key]   and the result: $ python get_hysto.py total:  16385 …  16385 is 0x4001, and 1 here is because max address of kernel for 1 page less then 2^48.  Summary, heap should not be aligned on 64 megabytes, this behaviour allows attacker to brute force heap of pthread created thread. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c1)  Florian Weimer    2018-02-28 13:21:17 UTC  ``` Flagging as security- because this is just hardening. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c2)  Ilya Smith    2018-02-28 15:45:40 UTC  ``` Hello,  Can you please explain me what exactly this hardening is? If this hardening of security, this should be a security bug, But if you think something different, please explain me.  From my point of view this bug only about security because lead to ASLR bypass. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c3)  Florian Weimer    2019-08-05 11:34:20 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ilya Smith from [comment #2](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c2)) > Hello, >  > Can you please explain me what exactly this hardening is? > If this hardening of security, this should be a security bug, > But if you think something different, please explain me. >  > From my point of view this bug only about security because lead to ASLR > bypass.  ASLR bypass itself is not a vulnerability.  It may simplify exploitation of another, unrelated vulnerability. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c4)  Adhemerval Zanella    2019-08-05 12:29:05 UTC  ``` My understanding of reporter intention is to point out the malloc heap alignment restriction lowers the total entropy available to kernel, which is an implementation detail from glibc. But I agree with Florian reasoning that this is hardening feature. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c5)  Ismael Ripoll    2020-02-21 15:10:49 UTC  ```  This patch solves the weakness discovered by Ilya Smith. The problem is important in x86_64, but we think that is SEVERE on other systems (4 ASLR bits is like no ASLR).  Ptmalloc aligns to a very large value the arenas. This large alignment greatly reduces the ASLR entropy of all the dynamically allocated data from thread code. Allocations carried out from main() are not affected, unless brk can not expand the heap.  The impact of the alignment greatly depends on the architecture.  The expected entropy shall be at least that of the mmap() on each system, but the actual entropy is shown in the following table:    +----------+--------+-----------------+   | System   |  Mmap  |  Thread malloc  |   +----------+--------+-----------------+   | x86_64   |   28   |        14       |   | i386     |    8   |         0       |     | x32      |    8   |         0       |   | ARM      |    8   |         0       |   | AARCH    |   18   |         4       |   | PPC64    |   14   |         4       |   | s390(64) |   11   |         4       |   | s390     |   11   |         3       |   +----------+--------+-----------------+  As it can be seen, all systems but x86_64 are severely affected by this weakness.  This patch removes the need to align arenas to HEAP_MAX_SIZE by changing the macro heap_for_ptr(ptr). Arenas are randomized with the same entropy than the rest of mmaped objects. The entropy to randomize the thread's arenas is obtained from the ASLR value of the libraries, by using the address of the __arena_rnd:  __arena_rnd = ((unsigned long)&__arena_rnd) & (HEAP_MAX_SIZE-1) &     		   ~(pagesize-1);  This way, if the user disables ASLR (via randomize_va_space, setarch -R, or when using gdb), the entropy of the arena is also automatically disabled.  Summary of the patch features:  *- Does not change the allocation policy. *- Does not add new data structures (only a long variable). *- The temporal overhead is almost undetectable (just 2 more cpu    instructions per free: one "add" and one "or"). malloc is not    affected. *- It is fully backward compatible. *- It restores completely, the ASLR entropy to thread's heaps.  With the patch the entropy on x86_64 is 28bits (15 more than the  current one), and i386 is 8bits (8 more), which is the same entropy that the mallocs made from the main thread.

However, patch discussion is done through the email list [1]. Could you re-send it on the libc-alpha?  It seems that alignment restriction was added originally to simplify the heap_for_ptr macro and I think it should be added on patch description (stating  there is no other restriction about arena alignment).  Also, would be possible to add a testcase? I am not sure which approach would be better (a maillist discussion might give some ideas). Maybe by parametrize the mmap entropy information you compiled on arch-specific files (similar to the stackinfo.h), create N thread that run M allocation, record the output, and compare the histogram with the expected entropy with a certain margin.  Finally, please also add the outcome of the bench-malloc-{simple,thread}  with and without the patch.  [1] <https://sourceware.org/mailman/listinfo/libc-alpha> ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1737445#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-08-05 11:30:46 UTC  ``` GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass. The impact is: Attacker may guess the heap addresses of pthread_created thread. The component is: glibc.  Reference: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22853>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1737445#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-08-05 11:31:11 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1737446](show_bug.cgi?id=1737446 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2019-1010025 glibc: information disclosure of heap addresses of pthread_created thread [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1737445#c3)  Marco Benatto    2019-08-06 21:43:15 UTC  ``` The information disclosure mentioned by [CVE-2019-1010025](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-1010025) is not considered a vulnerability and its fix should be considered a hardening instead. Although it's possible to eventually leak the thread heap's address by passing the ASLR mechanism, this bug is not exploitable by itself. An attack can not use this directly to perform any unexpected action, although this can be used to exploit any other unrelated software which consumes glibc's pthread API.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1737445#c4)  Marco Benatto    2019-08-06 21:49:21 UTC  ``` Statement:  This is does not affect the package glibc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6,7 and 8. The bug related to this CVE is not exploitable.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1737445#c5)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-07 01:18:18 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-1010025>   ``` |  |
