The provided content relates to a security fix in GLPI, specifically addressing the sanitization of content within the TinyMCE editor.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the TinyMCE editor which, by default, allowed the inclusion of `form` and `iframe` elements, and potentially other active content. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code via these elements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Lack of input sanitization/filtering for TinyMCE content.
- Allowing potentially harmful elements such as `form` and `iframe`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks could be carried out by injecting malicious JavaScript within the `iframe` tag or by using the `form` tag to phish for credentials.
- Potential for session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or other unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious HTML containing `form` or `iframe` tags into a TinyMCE editor field.
- The injected code would then be executed when a user viewed the affected content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires the ability to input content into a TinyMCE editor field within GLPI. This could be achieved by exploiting an existing vulnerability allowing access to this functionality.
- Would require sufficient user privileges to post/modify the malicious content.

**Additional details:**
The fix implemented in the pull request #5519 involves:
- Disallowing the `form` and `iframe` elements within TinyMCE content.
- Disallowing "on" attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`) in HTML tags, preventing script injection through event handlers.
- This pull request was labeled with both "bug" and "security".
- It was included in the 9.4.1 milestone.
-The fix was backported into other branches via pull request #5606
