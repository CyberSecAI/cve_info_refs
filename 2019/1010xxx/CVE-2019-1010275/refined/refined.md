The provided content relates to CVE-2019-1010275.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a weak certificate verification policy in Tiller, the server-side component of Helm. This policy allowed self-signed certificates to bypass server-side verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure TLS configuration: Tiller's certificate verification process was not strict enough, allowing self-signed certificates to be accepted. This meant a client could present a self-generated certificate that Tiller would incorrectly validate.
- Missing TLS parameters: A refactor had inadvertently removed TLS parameters from certain `helm get` commands and `helm list`, making it impossible to use TLS for those commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A malicious actor could potentially connect to Tiller using a self-signed certificate, bypassing the intended authentication mechanism. This could lead to unauthorized access and manipulation of Kubernetes resources managed by Helm.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious client could connect to the Tiller server with a self-signed certificate, successfully authenticating without presenting a valid certificate signed by a trusted CA.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to connect to the Tiller server.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a self-signed certificate.

**Additional details:**
- The fix requires client certificates to be verified against Tiller's CA.
- The fix also adds missing TLS parameters back to the `helm get *` commands and fixes `helm list --tls`.
- The vulnerability existed in Tiller versions prior to 2.7.1.
- The fix was released in Helm version 2.7.2.
