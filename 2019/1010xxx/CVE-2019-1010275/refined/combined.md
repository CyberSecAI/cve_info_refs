[v2.7.2](/helm/helm/tree/v2.7.2)

[`8478fb4`](/helm/helm/commit/8478fb4fc723885b155c924d1c8c410b7a9444e6)

Helm v2.7.2 is a security release and bug release. Users are strongly encouraged

to upgrade.

The Helm Core Maintainers discovered a bug in TLS handling. Versions of Tiller

prior to 2.7.1 had a certificate verification policy that allowed self-signed

certificates to pass the server-side certificate verification phase.

This release contains a fix that *requires* the client certificate to be verified

against Tiller's CA.

Additionally, this release adds documentation for configuring strong gRPC authentication

using TLS. While this feature has been available since 2.3.0, it was not properly

documented.

Finally, this release contains several TLS-related fixes to Helm CLI commands, adding TLS

parameters back to the `helm get *` verbs, and fixing `helm list --tls`.

The community keeps growing, and we'd love to see you there.

* Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://slack.k8s.io/):
  + `#helm-users` for questions and just to hang out
  + `#helm-dev` for discussing PRs, code, and bugs
* Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/4526666954)
* Test, debug, and contribute charts: [GitHub/kubernetes/charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts)

## Breaking Changes

This release places much more stringent requirements on certificate auth. It is

possible that some misconfigured Helm SSL configurations that were working are now

broken.

## Installation and Upgrading

Download Helm 2.7.2. The common platform binaries are here:

* [OSX](https://get.helm.sh/helm-v2.7.2-darwin-amd64.tar.gz)
* [Linux](https://get.helm.sh/helm-v2.7.2-linux-amd64.tar.gz)
* [Windows](https://get.helm.sh/helm-v2.7.2-windows-amd64.tar.gz)

Once you have the client installed, upgrade Tiller with `helm init --upgrade`.

The [Quickstart Guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#quickstart-guide) will get you going from there. For **upgrade instructions** or detailed installation notes, check the [install guide](https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm). You can also use a [script to install](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/helm/master/scripts/get) on any system with `bash`.
