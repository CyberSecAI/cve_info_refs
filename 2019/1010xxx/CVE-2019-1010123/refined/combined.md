# July 20, 2018 by Mark Hamstra [Critical Security Vulnerability in Gallery, update to 1.7.1!](/posts/2018/07/critical-security-vulnerability-in-gallery-1.7.1)

Following [the MODX 2.6.5 release last week containing a critical security fix](https://modx.today/posts/2018/07/modx-2.6.5-critical-security), today it has become clear that Gallery 1.7.0 (and before) are also vulnerable to a very similar vulnerability that can lead sites fully compromised.

**These vulnerabilities are being actively exploited, right now.**

If you use Gallery, [please upgrade to Gallery 1.7.1 immediately](https://modx.com/extras/package/gallery)
