svc: check for allocation overflow in crypto calls part 2

```
Without checking for overflow there is a risk of allocating a buffer
with size smaller than anticipated and as a consequence of that it might
lead to a heap based overflow with attacker controlled data written
outside the boundaries of the buffer.

Fixes: OP-TEE-2018-0011: "Integer overflow in crypto system calls (x2)"
