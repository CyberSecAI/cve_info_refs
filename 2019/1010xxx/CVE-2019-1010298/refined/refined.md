Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a missing check for integer overflows when calculating the size of a buffer to be allocated in the `syscall_asymm_operate` and `syscall_asymm_verify` functions within the OP-TEE OS. Specifically, the multiplication of `sizeof(TEE_Attribute)` and `num_params` could result in an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is the potential for an integer overflow during the calculation of the buffer size before memory allocation. If the result of `sizeof(TEE_Attribute) * num_params` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored, the actual allocated buffer size would be smaller than expected, leading to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** If a smaller buffer is allocated due to an overflow, subsequent copy operations could write data past the boundary of the allocated memory leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Unchecked Allocation Size:**  The `malloc` function is called with a size calculated without first verifying if the result of multiplication caused an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Heap Corruption:** An attacker could cause a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially corrupting heap metadata and other objects on the heap.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Depending on the memory layout, a successful heap overflow may allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by overwriting critical data or function pointers.
- **Denial of Service:**  Exploitation could result in system crashes or unpredictable behavior leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** An attacker could manipulate the number of parameters (`num_params`) passed to the `syscall_asymm_operate` or `syscall_asymm_verify` system calls such that the multiplication would cause an integer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to invoke syscalls:** The attacker needs to be able to invoke the vulnerable system calls (`syscall_asymm_operate` or `syscall_asymm_verify`). This would typically require the ability to communicate with the secure world or manipulate parameters passed by the rich OS.
- **Control of `num_params`:** The attacker needs some degree of control over the `num_params` variable, allowing to manipulate the size calculation to induce the integer overflow.

**Additional Notes:**

- This commit specifically addresses a fix for a previously reported issue (OP-TEE-2018-0011) related to integer overflows in crypto system calls, suggesting this is not the first time this type of issue was discovered.
- The fix introduces the `MUL_OVERFLOW` macro to check for integer overflows before allocating the buffer and return `TEE_ERROR_OVERFLOW` if an overflow occurs.
- The fix is applied to both `syscall_asymm_operate` and `syscall_asymm_verify` functions, indicating that both were vulnerable.
