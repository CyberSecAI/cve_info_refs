- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Saleor e-commerce platform, by default, exposes sensitive business information through its GraphQL API.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted access to sensitive data via the GraphQL API. The following fields were exposed: `quantity`, `quantityAllocated`, `costPrice`, `stockQuantity`, `margin`, `quantityOrdered`, `revenue` within the `ProductVariant` object.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized access to sensitive business data like product stock, cost prices, margins, and revenue. This could lead to competitive disadvantages, financial losses, or other forms of exploitation.
- **Attack vectors:** Publicly accessible GraphQL API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the publicly exposed GraphQL API. No authentication was required to access the data.
