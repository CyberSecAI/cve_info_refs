{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to buffer overflows in the `minilzo.c`, `nffile_inline.c`, and `nfx.c` files within the nfdump package.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause the program to crash by forcing it to dereference invalid memory addresses, and may achieve arbitrary code execution via heap overflows by crafting malicious nfcapd input files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting malformed nfcapd input files"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted input files to the nfdump program."
