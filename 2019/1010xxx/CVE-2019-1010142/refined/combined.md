## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

We recently discovered that the latest version of Scapy, a powerful packet manipulation tool used by cybersecurity researchers and network engineers, is susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. Ironically, we found this vulnerability while researching ways to better detect and fight DDoS attacks.

Written in the [very popular Python coding language](https://www.imperva.com/blog/the-worlds-most-popular-coding-language-happens-to-be-most-hackers-weapon-of-choice/), Scapy uses a heuristic algorithm to determine the type of network packet it is inspecting. Because the algorithm relies on port numbers, the packet type can be easily spoofed. In this case, the vulnerability occurs when Scapy is tricked into thinking a network packet is a [RADIUS packet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS). The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation when reading the length field in the RADIUS packet’s Attribute Value Pairs (AVP). This can cause an infinite loop in the following code section if a certain byte is set to zero:

![Scapy 1]()

![SCapy]()

Although this bug was reported and patched, **the current Scapy version 2.4.0 available from the Python pip repositories is susceptible to this attack**. We tested for this vulnerability using macOS and Ubuntu Linux with both Python 2.7 and Python 3 and found them all vulnerable.

Here is the remote exploit:

![Scapy 3]()

**Conclusion:**

The current version of Scapy can be DoSed quite easily. The potential impact is large – Scapy is quite a popular tool, and other libraries that depend on Scapy might be vulnerable as well. Networks relying on Scapy for traffic monitoring or other functions can also be affected.  If you’re using the affected version of Scapy, or any library that depends on Scapy, we advise you to apply the patch as soon as possible.

Advisory Scapy 2.4.0 – Denial of Services

Authors: Johnathan Azaria and Koby Kilimnik

Vendor url: <https://scapy.net/>

Status: Patched (but not released to pip repo)

Tested on: macOS sierra 10.12.6 and Ubuntu Linux 16.04

A partial list of libraries with a Scapy dependency that might be affected as well:

* IcmpTool-0.1.8
* jldcmds-0.3
* mim-0.2.43 – man in the middle proxy
* ooniprobe-1.3.2 – network analysis tool
* pyersinia-1.0.5 – another network analysis tool
* pysap-0.1.8 – python library that communicates with sap
* scapy-http-1.8

### @p-l- **[p-l-](/p-l-)** commented [May 11, 2018](#issue-322207305)

This class was useless since PacketListField does the job, moreover it

was buggy and could cause Scapy to go in a infinite loop. Test case

added.

Fixes [#1407](https://github.com/secdev/scapy/issues/1407).

Sorry, something went wrong.
