  "CVE-2019-1010142": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation when reading the length field in the RADIUS packetâ€™s Attribute Value Pairs (AVP). This can cause an infinite loop in the following code section if a certain byte is set to zero.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of input validation when reading the length field in RADIUS AVP",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Infinite loop vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS)",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted RADIUS packet with a specific byte set to zero.",
    "Required capabilities": "Ability to craft and send network packets.",
        "Additional Information": "The vulnerability exists in Scapy, a Python-based packet manipulation tool. It occurs when Scapy is tricked into parsing a network packet as a RADIUS packet. The affected version of Scapy is 2.4.0, available from the Python pip repositories. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely. It was tested on macOS and Ubuntu Linux with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.",
