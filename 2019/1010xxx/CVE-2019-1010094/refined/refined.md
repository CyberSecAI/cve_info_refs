The content is related to CVE-2019-1010094.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the domainmod application. This allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user without their knowledge.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, specifically allowing for:
    *  Changing the administrator's password.
    *  Adding a new administrator account.
    *  Elevating the privileges of a read-only user to administrator.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can take full control of the application by:
    *  Changing the administrator's password, locking out the legitimate admin.
    *  Creating a new admin account for persistent access.
    *  Elevating privileges of a read-only account, gaining admin access.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in administrator into loading a malicious HTML page. This page contains a form that automatically submits requests to the vulnerable application endpoints to perform the malicious actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs:
    *  To entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious web page.
    *  Knowledge of the vulnerable endpoints in the domainmod application.
    *  Ability to create a malicious HTML page.
