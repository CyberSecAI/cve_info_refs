The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1010294.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Trusted Application (TA) memory was not being completely cleared before a new TA was loaded into the same memory region. The memory was being cleared using the sizes of the code and data segments instead of clearing up to the allocation granularity, potentially leaking code or data from a previous loaded TA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete memory clearing: The code was only clearing the memory used by the code and data segments of the TA, not the entire allocated region.
- Potential information disclosure: Residual data from a previous TA could be accessed by subsequent TAs loaded into the same region.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: A malicious TA could potentially access code or data from a previously loaded TA, leading to sensitive information leakage.

**Attack vectors:**
- Loading a malicious TA after a legitimate one.
- Exploiting the vulnerability to read memory that was not properly cleared, potentially compromising the security of the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to load a malicious TA into the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the loading sequence of the TAs.
