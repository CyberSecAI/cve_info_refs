This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

core: clear the entire TA area

```
Previously we cleared (memset to zero) the size corresponding to code
and data segments, however the allocation for the TA is made on the
granularity of the memory pool, meaning that we did not clear all memory
and because of that we could potentially leak code and data of a
previous loaded TA.

Fixes: OP-TEE-2018-0006: "Potential disclosure of previously loaded TA
code and data"
