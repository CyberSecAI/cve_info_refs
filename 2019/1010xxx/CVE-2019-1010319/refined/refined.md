## CVE-2019-1010319

The content discusses a vulnerability in WavPack version 5.1.0 and earlier, specifically a use of an uninitialized variable in the `ParseWave64HeaderConfig` function.

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `ParseWave64HeaderConfig` function failing to properly initialize the `WaveHeader` data structure before use.

**Vulnerability details:**

*   **Weakness:** Use of an uninitialized variable. Specifically, the field `WaveHeader.NumChannels` is read without prior initialization.
*   **File and Line Number:** `cli/wave64.c:211`

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Impact:** The uninitialized read can lead to unexpected control flow, crashes, and segfaults, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS). In some cases, it leads to a divide-by-zero error.

**Attack vector:**

*   **Attack Vector:** A maliciously crafted `.wav` file can trigger the vulnerability when parsed by WavPack.

**Required attacker capabilities:**

*   **Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted `.wav` file to the WavPack application. User interaction is required to open the crafted file, affecting only the single run of Wavpack.

**Mitigation:**

*   The issue is resolved by clearing the WaveHeader structure at the start of the `ParseWave64HeaderConfig` function.
