The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1010293.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `tee_mmu_check_access_rights()` function within the OP-TEE OS. Prior to the fix, the function checked an address within each page of a given range. If the start and length of the range were unaligned, the last page of the range was sometimes not checked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an incomplete access control check. Specifically, the function `tee_mmu_check_access_rights()` didn't always check the last page of a provided memory range when the start address or the length was not aligned to the page size.

**Impact of exploitation:**
If the last page is not checked, it could allow access to memory regions that should be protected, potentially leading to privilege escalation, information disclosure, or other security breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a memory range with an unaligned start address and/or unaligned length, specifically crafted to bypass checks on the final page within a range.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to invoke `tee_mmu_check_access_rights()` with a crafted memory range. This could be achieved by exploiting a vulnerable Trusted Application (TA) that uses the function, or potentially by other means if direct access to the function is possible.
