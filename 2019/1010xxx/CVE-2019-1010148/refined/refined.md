{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `user/adv.php` file of ZZCMS where user-controlled input, specifically the `oldimg` parameter, is used in an `unlink()` function without sufficient validation. This allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary file deletion",
      "Lack of input validation",
	  "Code injection via `install/index.php`"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server. By deleting `install/install.lock`, the attacker can then execute code by manipulating the `$url` parameter during reinstallation via `install/index.php`, thus leading to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP requests to `user/adv.php` with the `action=modify` and a crafted `oldimg` parameter",
	  "HTTP requests to `install/index.php` with a crafted `url` parameter after deleting `install/install.lock`"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have some understanding of the file structure. The attacker needs to have a valid session (user privileges) to access `user/adv.php`."
