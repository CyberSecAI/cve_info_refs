The provided content relates to CVE-2019-1010279.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to improper handling of TCP RST packets within the Suricata stream engine. Specifically, when a bad RST packet is received, the stream inspection process is skipped, but the "raw progress" tracker is still advanced. This leads to subsequent valid packets being incorrectly processed, resulting in a false negative, where malicious content is not detected.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The core weakness lies in the stream reassembly logic within Suricata not properly accounting for the sequence of TCP events, leading to potential bypass.
- Incorrect advancement of the "raw progress" tracker on a bad RST packet prevents proper inspection of subsequent data within the TCP stream.
- Mishandling of RST packets can lead to the stream being desynchronized in the context of Suricata's inspection mechanism.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when the stream receives a FIN/ACK immediately after a request and before a response, followed by an RST/ACK after the response.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can bypass Suricata's detection rules by sending specifically crafted TCP packets with RST flags.
-  This can result in undetected malicious traffic, leading to potential system compromise or data breaches.
- The vulnerability impacts the accuracy and effectiveness of Suricata as an intrusion detection and prevention system.
- An attacker can send a TCP stream with FIN/ACK and RST/ACK packets to evade detection, particularly for HTTP traffic.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to send specially crafted TCP packets within a traffic stream monitored by Suricata.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the TCP stream by sending FIN/ACK packets before a server response, and then an RST/ACK packet after the server replies to a request.
- This can be done by creating a slow network connection, overloading the server, or using another technique that enables the attacker to send the FIN/ACK packet before the response arrives.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network such that they can send TCP packets that are inspected by a vulnerable instance of Suricata.
- They also need the ability to manipulate TCP flags (FIN, RST, ACK) to create the specific conditions needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can also use tools to create the conditions necessary to trigger the vulnerability, such as a tool to introduce delays.
