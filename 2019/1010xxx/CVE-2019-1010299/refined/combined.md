# vec\_deque::Iter has unsound Debug implementation¬†#53566

## Description

![@RalfJung](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/330628?u=562ead6e5c8da9a02015f73a9aefdb6c82d4e2cf&v=4&size=48)[RalfJung](https://github.com/RalfJung)opened [on Aug 21, 2018](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53566#issue-352628470)

Found by [@MaloJaffre](https://github.com/MaloJaffre): The following code causes UB (not observable through crashes, but still):

```
use std::collections::VecDeque;
fn main() {
    println!("{:?}", VecDeque::<u32>::new().iter());
}
```

This will create a `VecDeque` ring with capacity 8, then turn that into a slice for `Iter`, and then print that entire slice. [Run it in Miri](https://play.rust-lang.org/?gist=d335741994d2e93b78a576c5fa7bdbfb&version=nightly&mode=release&edition=2015) to see for yourself (Miri is in the "tools" menu).
