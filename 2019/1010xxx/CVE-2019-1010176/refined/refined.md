The content relates to CVE-2019-1010176.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap buffer overflow occurs in the `lit_char_to_utf8_bytes` function within the JerryScript engine when processing a specific UTF-8 character within a regular expression literal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap buffer overflow in `lit_char_to_utf8_bytes`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash due to heap corruption, potentially leading to denial-of-service.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution (although not explicitly stated in this issue, it's a common consequence of heap overflows)

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing crafted Javascript code containing a specific UTF-8 character in a regular expression literal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide input to the JerryScript engine (e.g., through a web page using Javascript, via command line evaluation, etc.).
- No special permissions required, as the overflow is triggered during the regular parsing of code.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided test case is a simple script `0\n/รฐ/` which causes the crash when parsed by JerryScript.
- The stack trace shows the exact location where the overflow occurs, and reveals it originates from parsing a regular expression.
- The issue has been fixed in PR [#2480](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/pull/2480), thus this is a historical vulnerability report.
- The issue was triggered by a test case that included a 'รฐ' character.
