## Description

![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Mar 4, 2018](https://github.com/archivesunleashed/graphpass/issues/4#issue-302079863)

A buffer overflow scenario can be created within borg-reducer. The `dir` and `filepath` variables within `borg-reducer.h's write_report` function is vulnerable to this attack.

The output variable is set without any bounds at:

<https://github.com/archivesunleashed/borg-reducer/blob/c6d5240e37f5aa08ab49fca519cfd72098da10fb/borg-reducer.c#L80>

This is then later used in the `write_report` function:

<https://github.com/archivesunleashed/borg-reducer/blob/c6d5240e37f5aa08ab49fca519cfd72098da10fb/Include/borg-reducer.h#L58>

Both of the above-mentioned variables are of size 150. If we make output have a length > 300, a buffer overflow scenario will be produced and cause a crash.
