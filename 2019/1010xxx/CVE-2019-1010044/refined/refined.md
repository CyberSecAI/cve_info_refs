The provided content describes a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `borg-reducer` tool, specifically within the `write_report` function. This issue was reported on GitHub and includes code references.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an unbounded write to the `output` variable, which is then used in `write_report` function with fixed-size buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Buffer overflow: The `output` variable is not checked for length when set, which is used in `write_report` where the variables `dir` and `filepath` are copied to, these are of fixed size 150. If output has a length greater than 300 a buffer overflow will happen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash: The buffer overflow can cause the program to crash due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Input manipulation: By providing an input that results in a large `output` string (greater than 300 characters long), an attacker can trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide inputs to the `borg-reducer` tool that influence the length of the `output` variable. The specific manner of influencing the output is not detailed.
