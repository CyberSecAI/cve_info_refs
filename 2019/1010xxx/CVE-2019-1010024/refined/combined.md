| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=22852#c0)  Ilya Smith    2018-02-16 12:09:35 UTC  ``` In current implementation for any thread created with pthread_create glibc will create a new heap after the first malloc call from context of this thread. GNU Libc have special caches to keep stacks of finished threads and there's heaps. This caches allow glibc make faster creation of threads and its heaps. On any call to pthread_create or malloc from thread glibc first checks appropriated caches in hope to find already mmaped regions. And if find any use them.  The problem here is this behaviour totally breaks ASLR - if attacker can leak address of ended thread stack or heap, he can use this address later in any vulnerability in hope to get the same stack region / heap memory region and successfully exploit application.  Current kernel implementation of ASLR is going to be improved I hope. I prepared patches which will random addresses returned by kernel on any mmap.  Here is Proof of Concepts:  #include <pthread.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <errno.h> #include <sys/mman.h> #include <asm/prctl.h> #include <sys/prctl.h>  void * func(void *x) { 	long a[1024]; 	printf("addr: %p\n", &a[0]); 	if (x) 		printf("value %lx\n", a[0]); 	else 	{ 		a[0] = 0xdeadbeef; 		printf("value %lx\n", a[0]); 	} 	void * addr = malloc(32); 	printf("malloced %p\n", addr); 	free(addr); 	return 0; }  int main(int argc, char **argv, char **envp) {    int res, val; 	pthread_t thread; 	res = pthread_create(&thread, NULL, func, 0); 	if (res) 	{ 		printf("Failed create thread %d\n", errno); 		return -1; 	} 	pthread_join(thread, &val); 	res = pthread_create(&thread, NULL, func, 1); 	if (res) 	{ 		printf("Failed create thread %d\n", errno); 		return -1; 	} 	pthread_join(thread, &val); 	return 0; }  and run: blackzert@crasher:~/aslur/tests$ ./pthread_cache addr: 0x7ffb90c52f40 value deadbeef malloced 0x7ffb8c000cd0 addr: 0x7ffb90c52f40 value deadbeef malloced 0x7ffb8c000cd0  with strace: blackzert@crasher:~/aslur/tests$ strace -e mmap,munmap ./pthread_cache mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f134346d000 mmap(NULL, 146377, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, 3, 0) = 0x7f1343449000 mmap(NULL, 2212904, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0x7f134302d000 mmap(0x7f1343244000, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x17000) = 0x7f1343244000 mmap(0x7f1343246000, 13352, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1343246000 mmap(NULL, 3971488, PROT_READ|PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0) = 0x7f1342c63000 mmap(0x7f1343023000, 24576, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_DENYWRITE, 3, 0x1c0000) = 0x7f1343023000 mmap(0x7f1343029000, 14752, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1343029000 mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1343448000 mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1343447000 mmap(NULL, 4096, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1343446000 munmap(0x7f1343449000, 146377)          = 0 mmap(NULL, 8392704, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS|MAP_STACK, -1, 0) = 0x7f1342462000 addr: 0x7f1342c5ff40 value deadbeef malloced 0x7f133c000cd0 addr: 0x7f1342c5ff40 value deadbeef malloced 0x7f133c000cd0 +++ exited with 0 +++  As you can see no mmap call between allocation. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=22852#c1)  Florian Weimer    2018-02-28 13:21:40 UTC  ``` Flagging as security- because this is a request for additional hardening. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=22852#c2)  Ilya Smith    2018-02-28 15:44:54 UTC  ``` Hello,  Can you please explain me what exactly this hardening is? If this hardening of security, this should be a security bug, But if you think something different, please explain me.  From my point of view this bug only about security because lead to ASLR bypass or in some cases may be used as exploitation technique. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=22852#c3)  Carlos O'Donell    2019-10-15 13:38:59 UTC  ``` One way to harden is to use a tunable for a thread stack cache, and set that to zero. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=22852#c4)  He Dian    2020-10-16 09:18:36 UTC  ``` hello, I would like to ask why so far this bug has not been fixed in glibc ``` |  |

The impact is: Attacker may bypass ASLR using cache of thread stack and heap. The component is: glibc.  References:    <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/109162> <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22852> <https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K06046097> <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1010024>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1773927#c1)  msiddiqu    2019-11-19 10:56:26 UTC  ``` Created glibc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1773928](show_bug.cgi?id=1773928 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2019-1010024 glibc: ASLR bypass using cache of thread stack and heap [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1773927#c2)  Florian Weimer    2019-11-19 11:17:16 UTC  ``` Not a security vulnerability. We need to reuse thread stacks for performance reasons.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1773927#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-11-20 10:31:18 UTC  ``` This is not a security vulnerability, but just a way to exploit a program that uses pthread_create. This requires an already vulnerable application with an attacker that has already compromised it. The attacker would need to have a way to leak an address in the stack/heap of a thread and a primitive to write data there (e.g. buffer overflow). This could be considered just hardening, as said in the upstream bug.   ``` |  |

Bug: <https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22851> Patch: No fix yet, WIP by upstream  2) CVE-2019-1010024 Description: "GNU Libc current is affected by: Mitigation bypass.
