Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-1010024:

*   **Description:** The vulnerability involves a mitigation bypass in GNU Libc (glibc). An attacker could potentially bypass Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) by exploiting the caching of thread stacks and heaps.
*   **Component:** glibc
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker may bypass ASLR.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker needs to leak the address of an ended thread stack or heap.
*   **Vulnerability Details:**
    *   Glibc caches stacks and heaps of finished threads to speed up thread creation. An attacker who can leak the address of an ended thread's stack or heap can potentially reuse the same memory region in a future vulnerability exploit.
*   **Status:**
    *   Upstream comments indicate this is being treated as a non-security bug and no real threat.
    *   Red Hat, SUSE, and Ubuntu marked this as not a security vulnerability.
    *   Gentoo notes that if an attacker *already* has a write primitive, ASLR is less effective.
*   **Severity Score:**
    *   CVSS v3: 5.3 (Medium)
    *   CVSS v3 Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
    *   CVSS v2: 5.0
    *   CVSS v2 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N
*   **Root Cause:** Glibc reuses thread stacks for performance reasons.
*   **Mitigation Bypass:** ASLR.
*   **Red Hat's comment:** Not a security vulnerability.
*   **Riccardo Schirone's comment:** This is not a security vulnerability, but just a way to exploit a program that uses pthread\_create. This requires an already vulnerable application with an attacker that has already compromised it. The attacker would need to have a way to leak an address in the stack/heap of a thread and a primitive to write data there (e.g. buffer overflow). This could be considered just hardening, as said in the upstream bug.
