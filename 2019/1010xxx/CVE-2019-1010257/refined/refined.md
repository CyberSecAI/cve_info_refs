[CVE-2019-1010257] PDF file download path is constructed from insufficiently sanitised user input

Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability arises from the plugin's inadequate sanitization of user-supplied input parameters used to construct the file path for PDF downloads.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insufficient sanitization of the 'p', 'r', and 'd' parameters in the download URL
- Allows path traversal
- Null byte injection vulnerability in older PHP versions (<5.3)
- In newer PHP versions (>=5.3), the vulnerability allows reading files with a ".pdf" extension by manipulating the file path.

Impact of exploitation:
- Information Disclosure: Arbitrary file read is possible, allowing attackers to potentially access sensitive files on the server.
- File Deletion: If the webserver user has write access to the file, downloaded files can be deleted.
- Wordpress Installation Directory Disclosure: If a user does not have write access, an error may be displayed revealing the WordPress installation directory.

Attack vectors:
The vulnerability is exploited by crafting a malicious URL to download PDF files. This URL manipulates the 'p', 'r', and 'd' query parameters.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
- The attacker must understand how to manipulate the parameters of the download URL to perform path traversal or file reading.
