Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1010190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `putwhitespan()` function within the `g3/pbm2g3.c` file of the `mgetty` software. This occurs when processing malformed pbm (Portable BitMap) image files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The `putwhitespan()` function reads beyond the allocated memory when handling specially crafted pbm files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial of service. If the out-of-bounds read accesses unmapped memory, the program may crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attack vector is local.
*   **File-based:** The victim must open a specially crafted pbm file to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to create or modify pbm files and have the victim (user or system) process such file with the vulnerable `mgetty` application.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in `mgetty` version 1.2.1.
*   The issue was identified and reported by X41 D-Sec GmbH.
*   SUSE has released security updates to address the vulnerability in various products including SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop and openSUSE Leap.
