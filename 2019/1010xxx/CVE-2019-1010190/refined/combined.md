# NEWS

X41 D-Sec GmbH Security Advisory: X41-2018-007

# Multiple Vulnerabilities in mgetty

## Overview

**Confirmed Affected Versions:** 1.2.0

**Patched Versions:** 1.2.1

**Vendor:** mgetty

**Vendor URL:** http://mgetty.greenie.net

**Credit:** X41 D-Sec GmbH, Eric Sesterhenn

**Status:** Public

**Advisory-URL:** https://www.x41-dsec.de/lab/advisories/x41-2018-007-mgetty

## Summary and Impact

Multiple issues have been identified in the mgetty fax software. These might be used by local users to elevate their privileges.

X41 did not perform a full test or audit of the software.

## Product Description

From the vendor: For those of you that do not know mgetty+sendfax yet: itâs a reliable and proven fax send and receive solution for unix and Linux. But it can do much moreâ¦ so read the docs and be surprised.

# Shell injection via faxq-helper

**Severity Rating:** Medium

**Vector:** Fax Job

**CVE:** CVE-2018-16741

**CWE:** 78

**CVSS Score:** 6.1

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:H/A:N

| In fax/faxq-helper.c function `do_activate()`, not all characters are properly sanitized to prevent command injection. It is possible to use | Â | , && or > to change the control flow. |
| --- | --- | --- |

```
        /* replace all quote characters, backslash and ';' by '_' */
        for( q = buf; *q != '\0'; q++ )
        {
            if ( *q == '\'' || *q == '"' || *q == '`' ||
                 *q == '\\' || *q == ';' )
                                    { *q = '_'; }
        }
```

A job file containing malicious input can be constructed using `faxq-helper activate <jobid>`. One `faxrunq` is started, the code is executed as the user running the command.

```
        /* replace all quote characters, backslash and ';' by '_' */
    #               "   '    `  \    $   ;
    command=`tr -d '\042\047\140\134\044\073' <JOB | \
             $AWK 'BEGIN { phone="-"; flags=""; pages="" }
                  $1=="phone" { phone=$2 }
                  $1=="header"     { flags=flags" -h "$2 }
                  $1=="poll"       { flags=flags" -p" }
                  $1=="normal_res" { flags=flags" -n" }
                  $1=="acct_handle" { flags=flags" -A \""substr($0,13)"\"" }
                  $1=="pages" { for( i=2; i<=NF; i++) pages=pages$i" " }
                  END { printf "'"$FAX_SENDER"' -v%s %s %s", \
                               flags, phone, pages }' -`

#
# execute faxsend command
#
    $echo "$command"
    eval $command
```

# Stack Based Buffer Overflow With Long Username in contrib/next-login/login.c

**Severity Rating:** Low

**Vector:** Command Line Parameter

**CVE:** CVE-2018-16743

**CWE:** 121

**CVSS Score:** 2.9

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

In file contrib/next-login/login.c the command line parameter `username` is passed unsanitized to `strcpy()`, which causes a stack based buffer overflow if too long.

```
        char tbuf[MAXPATHLEN + 2], tname[sizeof(_PATH_TTY) + 10];
...
        if (*argv) {
                username = *argv;
                ask = 0;
...
                if (failures && strcmp(tbuf, username)) {
                        if (failures > (pwd ? 0 : 1))
                                badlogin(tbuf);
                        failures = 0;
                }
                (void)strcpy(tbuf, username);
```

# Stack Based Buffer Overflow With Long Argument in contrib/scrts.c

**Severity Rating:** Low

**Vector:** Command Line Parameter

**CVE:** CVE-2018-16742

**CWE:** 121

**CVSS Score:** 2.9

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

In file contrib/scrts.c a stack buffer overflow can be triggered via command line parameter.

```
int main( int argc, char ** argv )
{
int i, fd;
struct termios tio;
char device[1000];

    for ( i=1; i<argc; i++ )
    {
        if ( strchr( argv[i], '/' ) == NULL )
            sprintf( device, "/dev/%s", argv[i] );
        else
            strcpy( device, argv[i] );
```

# Stack Based Buffer Overflow and Command injection in faxrec.c

**Severity Rating:** Low

**Vector:** Command Line Parameter

**CVE:** CVE-2018-16744 (for command injection), CVE-2018-16745 (for overflow)

**CWE:** 121

**CVSS Score:** 2.9

**CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

In file faxrec.c function `fax_notify_mail()`, the `mail_to` parameter is not sanitized. It could allow for command injection or a buffer overflow if it is too long. If is called from `facrec()` which in turn is called from `main()` in mgetty.c. Since the `notify_mail` parameter is a configuration parameter, it should only be possible to set it from trusted source. If mgetty would be used with e.g. a webfront end, this might be abused for a privilege escalation.

```
void fax_notify_mail _P3( (pagenum, ppagenum, mail_to),
                          int pagenum, int ppagenum, char * mail_to )
{
FILE  * pipe_fp;
char  * file_name, * p;
char    buf[256];
int     r;
time_t  ti;

    lprintf( L_NOISE, "fax_notify_mail: sending mail to: %s", mail_to );

    sprintf( buf, "%s %s >/dev/null 2>&1", MAILER, mail_to );

    pipe_fp = popen( buf, "w" );
```

# Endless loop in g3/g32pbm.c

When converting g32 files using g3/g32pbm.c, an endless loop can be triggered by malformed input file. Example can be found at https://github.com/x41sec/advisories/blob/master/X41-2018-007/files/g32pmb\_infinite\_loop.

# Out Of Bounds Access in g3/pbm2g3.c

When converting pbm files using g3/pbm2g3.c, out of bounds accesses can occur with malformed input files in `putwhitespan()`. An example can be found with https://github.com/x41sec/advisories/blob/master/X41-2018-007/files/pbm2g2\_oob\_access.

```
     putcode( t_white[l].bit_code, t_white[l].bit_length );
```

## Workaround

None.
