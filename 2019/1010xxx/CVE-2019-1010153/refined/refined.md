{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data within a cookie before it is used in a SQL query.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
	  "Lack of input validation",
      "Unsanitized user input"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "entry_points": [
        "The `zzcmscpid` cookie is used in the `showcookiezs` function within `zs/subzs.php`"
      ],
      "attack_details": "The `showcookiezs` function uses the `zzcmscpid` cookie value directly within a SQL query. By crafting a malicious cookie value containing SQL syntax, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the database query. The `showlabel` function and `fixed` function are used to process the cookie data and lead to the vulnerable code.",
        "required_capabilities": [
           "Ability to set cookies"
         ]
    }
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided PoC shows how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability by injecting a `UNION SELECT` statement, along with a `sleep` function to demonstrate the successful execution of injected SQL code."
