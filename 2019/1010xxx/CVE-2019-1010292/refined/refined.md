The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1010292.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists in the `set_rmem_param()` function within the OP-TEE OS. The function processes parameters related to shared memory objects (MOBJ). Prior to the patch, it was not verifying if the supplied sub-range (offset and size) of the MOBJ was within the bounds of the actual memory covered by the MOBJ, especially for pseudo TAs. This lack of validation could lead to out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing bounds check: The code lacked a check to ensure the provided offset and size for shared memory access were within the bounds of the MOBJ.
- Parameter injection: An attacker could potentially supply offset and size values that would allow out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access: By providing a large size or offset, a malicious entity could access memory outside the intended MOBJ region.
- Potential for privilege escalation, data corruption or denial of service: The out-of-bounds read/write could be exploited to cause data corruption or bypass security mechanisms, or potentially causing a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing parameters passed from the REE (Rich Execution Environment) to the TEE (Trusted Execution Environment), specifically via the `set_rmem_param` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to control the parameters passed from the REE to the TEE, specifically the `shm_ref`, `offs`, and `size` parameters of the `optee_msg_param_rmem` structure. This suggests the attacker would need to have some control over the untrusted OS to be able to construct and send malicious parameters.
