{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "In the `user/licence_save.php` file, the `oldimg` parameter, which is taken from `$_POST`, is used to construct a file path to be deleted if the 'action' is 'modify'. The application doesn't sufficiently validate the `oldimg` path, allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary files for deletion. The installation script `/install/index.php` uses `extract($_GET, EXTR_SKIP)` which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code by manipulating GET parameters and overwrite configuration file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to insufficient path validation in `user/licence_save.php`.",
    "Code injection vulnerability due to use of `extract($_GET, EXTR_SKIP)` in `/install/index.php`.",
     "The application uses `extract()` with user-supplied GET parameters, which can lead to overwriting existing variables, including those used in subsequent file operations."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, including critical system files like `/install/install.lock`, and inject malicious php code to achieve code execution by triggering the install script",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Sending a POST request to `/user/licence_save.php` with the action parameter set to `modify` and the `oldimg` parameter set to the path of the file to be deleted.",
    "Sending a GET request to `/install/index.php` with the `url` parameter set to a malicious PHP code."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the target server. They don't need to be authenticated to exploit the file deletion vulnerability (based on the provided code, but not mentioned explicitly), but might need to be authenticated to the modify the license in order to trigger this path, then must be able to access the install script and provide malicious GET parameter in order to trigger the code execution."
