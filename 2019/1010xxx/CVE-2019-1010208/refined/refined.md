The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1010208.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a read of kernel stack memory in the VeraCrypt driver. Specifically, the driver was reading a small amount of kernel stack memory (3 bytes, potentially up to 25 bytes in rare cases).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel stack memory disclosure: The driver was reading data from the kernel stack, potentially leaking sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information residing in kernel memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious actor with the ability to send a specially crafted I/O request to the vulnerable driver would trigger the vulnerability

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to send IOCTL requests to the VeraCrypt driver. This likely requires some level of local access or the ability to execute code with elevated privileges on the target machine.
