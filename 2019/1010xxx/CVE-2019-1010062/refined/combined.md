## Description

![@CodeKlaus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16705676?u=58ee9bee5263f89c430739e8eb6bc1a38d296455&v=4&size=48)[CodeKlaus](https://github.com/CodeKlaus)opened [on Apr 11, 2017](https://github.com/pluck-cms/pluck/issues/44#issue-221030477)

Hi! I found a Unrestricted File Upload Vulnerability on PluckCMS 4.7.4.

I found i can bypass the filetype detection on background site by modifying the MIME type on HTTP request. And with uploading a PHP File, i can get a webshell.
