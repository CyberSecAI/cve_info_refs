## Description

![@prodigysml](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/16996819?u=8ac045207384ce660425a4fdded4a836e20988a2&v=4&size=48)[prodigysml](https://github.com/prodigysml)opened [on Mar 2, 2018](https://github.com/ps2homebrew/wLaunchELF/issues/14#issue-301638157)

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the loader.c file. This is in regards to both the `s` variable and the `partition` variable.

The partition variable contains `argv[1]` which is user controlled as displayed below:

<https://github.com/AKuHAK/uLaunchELF/blob/75b22d9b0d5a23f4b758d6498e6e7a185b744523/loader/loader.c#L126>

This variable has a size of 128 characters, making it simple to overflow:

<https://github.com/AKuHAK/uLaunchELF/blob/75b22d9b0d5a23f4b758d6498e6e7a185b744523/loader/loader.c#L51>

Running with `argv[1] = A * 400` (400 A's) will make the application crash. This weakness may be used to change the intended execution flow of the program.
