Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an insecure file upload implementation in the GoURL.io WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin uses a substring operation on the filename to determine the file extension, taking the first 95 characters of the provided filename.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The plugin does not properly validate the file extension of uploaded files. It relies on a simple substring operation instead of a more secure method to determine the file extension.
*   **Filename Truncation:** By using the first 95 characters of a filename and ignoring the rest, the check becomes ineffective. An attacker can craft a filename with a ".php" extension within the first 95 characters, followed by ".jpg" or other innocuous extensions, tricking the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file disguised as a JPG file, which can be executed on the server. This allows for complete server compromise.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker may modify the appearance or content of the website, potentially causing damage to the website's reputation.
*   **Data Breaches:** Once inside the server, the attacker can gain access to sensitive data from the database or other server locations, which may lead to a significant data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP File Upload:** The attacker exploits the vulnerable file upload form in the WordPress plugin. The attacker sends a crafted POST request with a malicious php file with an appropriate name to bypass the filename check.
*   **Web Interface:** The attacker can access the website via the web interface, making use of the upload form and the vulnerable plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the WordPress site where the plugin is installed.
*   **Web Interaction:** The attacker must be able to interact with the website through HTTP requests and have access to the file upload form.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerable function is located at `https://github.com/cryptoapi/Bitcoin-Wordpress-Plugin/blob/8aa17068d7ba31a05f66e0ab2bbb55efb0f60017/gourl.php#L5637`.

The provided Proof-of-Concept (PoC) in `poc.html` demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability. The PoC shows a form that uploads a file with the malicious filename "123456789a123456789b123456789c123456789d123456789e123456789f123456789g123456789h123456789i1.php.jpg".

The filename is designed so that ".php" will be within the first 95 characters, while the file extension is actually ".jpg", deceiving the vulnerable code. The uploaded file will be saved with a `.php` extension on the server and subsequently executed by a webserver.

The provided information is more detailed than a generic CVE description by providing the vulnerable code location, a functional PoC and a detailed explanation of the vulnerability.
