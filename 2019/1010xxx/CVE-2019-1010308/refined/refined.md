The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1010308.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a commit that introduced a feature to allow login without a password in development (DEV) mode. This was achieved by setting the `$config['admin']['allpass']` to `true` in `config.override.php` when the `DEV` constant is enabled. Additionally, the `db_Users::authenticate()` function was modified to bypass password checks if the `allpass` parameter is set to true, effectively enabling passwordless login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is the unconditional bypass of authentication when DEV mode is enabled. This effectively disables password protection for backend logins in development environments. The commit also introduces an optional `$allpass` parameter to the authenticate function which allows bypassing the password check if set to true.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker, if able to access the backend while the system is in DEV mode, can gain complete administrative access to the system without knowing any valid credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could gain administrative access by browsing to the login page of the backend if the `DEV` mode is enabled.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the backend of the application while it is running in DEV mode. This could happen if the development settings are accidentally left enabled on a production server, or if the attacker can somehow enable it on a server.
