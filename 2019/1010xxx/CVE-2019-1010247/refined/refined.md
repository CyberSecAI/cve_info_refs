### CVE-2019-1010247

#### Description
The OIDCRedirectURI page contains generated JavaScript code that uses a poll parameter as a string variable, thus might contain additional JavaScript code. This might result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

#### Root cause
The `OIDCRedirectURI` page in `libapache2-mod-auth-openidc` uses a `poll` parameter as a string variable in generated JavaScript code without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

#### Weakness
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input validation.

#### Impact of exploitation
An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

#### Attack vector
By crafting a malicious URL with a `poll` parameter containing JavaScript code.

#### Required attacker capabilities
The attacker needs to be able to influence the `poll` parameter in the URL that is used to generate the `OIDCRedirectURI` page.
