The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Dolibarr web application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing attackers to trigger sensitive actions by crafting malicious requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF:** The core weakness is the absence of CSRF tokens or other mechanisms to validate that requests originate from legitimate user actions within the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **User deletion:** An attacker can disable users by triggering a delete action.
*   **Password change:** An attacker can change user passwords without the legitimate user's consent.
*   **Disable password encryption:** An attacker can disable password encryption, potentially exposing passwords to further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious HTML:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing requests that, when accessed by an authenticated user, perform actions on the Dolibarr application.
*   **GET Requests:** The described attacks leverage GET requests, making them easy to embed in HTML pages and trick users into executing them.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Knowledge of application endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the URLs and parameters to trigger the vulnerable actions.
*   **Targeted user with an active session:** The attacker needs to lure a logged-in Dolibarr user to visit the malicious HTML page while they have a valid session with Dolibarr.
