### @bigpresh **[bigpresh](/bigpresh)** commented [May 5, 2018](#issue-320540127)

Oh, man.

Some places called `_ensure_auth()` in void context, presumably thinking it would modify the handler coderef given to inject authentication checking - but it doesn't, `_ensure_auth()` returns a new coderef which does the required authentication checks then calls the original handler coderef which was given to `_ensure_auth()`. So, calling it in void context then passing the original handler coderef when setting up the route means there's no actual checking done on that route. Oops.

This is a pretty embarassing fuckup - a security problem on one of my projects. I hold my hands up and apologise to anyone affected by this, for this is a stupid mistake. A better test suite would have caught this.

I will see if a CVE ID is warranted for this, and apply for one if so.

Big thanks to [@joshrabinowitz](https://github.com/joshrabinowitz) for finding and reporting this one, and for adding tests which demonstrated the issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[SECURITY: use _ensure_auth() properly.](/bigpresh/Dancer-Plugin-SimpleCRUD/pull/109/commits/b73c39253be160d4c550c4962ad801a4e7cd3221 "SECURITY: use _ensure_auth() properly.

At some points in the codebase, _ensure_auth() was being used in void context,
presumably under the belief that it would modify the handler coderef given to
it; it doesn't do that, it uses DPAE's require_login / require_role etc methods,
which return a coderef which does the required checks (is logged in, has the
appropriate role, etc) then executes the original coderef if all is OK.

So, calling that in void context does nothing - the coderef with the user/role
checking is just thrown away, and the original, non-authenticated coderef used
as the route handler.

This is pretty embarassing stuff, a security cockup in one of my projects is
awful, and I hold my hands up and apologise.

It also highlights that the test suite wasn't robust enough, or tests would have
been failing.

Thanks, @joshrabinowitz for finding and reporting it, and for adding tests which
