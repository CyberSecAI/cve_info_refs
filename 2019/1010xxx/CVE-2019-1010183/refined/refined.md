The provided content is related to a pull request that addresses a potential uncontrolled recursion vulnerability in the `serde-yaml` crate. This pull request is linked to the reported issues of "Stack overflow crash cases #90" and "RUSTSEC-2018-0005: Uncontrolled recursion leads to abort in deserialization".

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the potential for uncontrolled recursion during deserialization of YAML data in the `serde-yaml` crate. This means that a specially crafted YAML input with nested structures could cause the deserialization process to recurse infinitely, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Uncontrolled recursion leading to stack overflow.
- Lack of proper depth limits during deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack overflow, leading to program termination/abort
- Denial of Service (DoS)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Providing a malicious YAML input to the `serde-yaml` deserialization function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide input to a program using the `serde-yaml` library

**Additional Details:**
- The pull request `Prevent too deep recursion #105` introduces a fix by limiting the recursion depth during deserialization.
- The pull request is linked to `chyh1990/yaml-rust#109`, suggesting a fix in the underlying yaml-rust library.
- The issue is also tracked under `RUSTSEC-2018-0005`
