  "cve": "CVE-2019-1010163",
  "attack_vector": "Local",
  "attack_complexity": "High",
  "vulnerability": "Buffer Overflow",
  "description": "Socusoft's Photo 2 Video Converter v8.0.0 (Free and Professional variants) contains a local buffer overflow condition in the pdmlog.dll library. Exploitation can result in register rewrites to control program execution flow, therefore, resulting in the ability to execute arbitrary shellcode leading to complete system compromise.",
  "affected_software": "Socusoft Photo 2 Video Converter v8.0.0 (Free and Professional variants)",
  "root_cause": "Buffer overflow in pdmlog.dll due to insufficient bounds checking when handling user-supplied input.",
  "impact": "Arbitrary code execution leading to complete system compromise.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to modify the registry of the target system, specifically the \"TempFolder\" value under \"HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Socusoft Photo to Video Converter Free Version\\General\".",
  "exploit": "The provided exploit code crafts a .reg file that, when imported, overwrites the 'TempFolder' registry value with a malicious payload. This payload consists of padding, an EIP overwrite to redirect execution to a PUSH ESP; RETN instruction, and space for shellcode."
