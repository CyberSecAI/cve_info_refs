The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in OECMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper CSRF protection mechanisms in the OECMS administrator add user functionality. Specifically, the form used to add new administrators lacks any authentication or token verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF protection: The form does not include anti-CSRF tokens or any other measures to prevent unauthorized requests.
- Predictable form parameters: The form uses easily predictable parameters which an attacker can replicate in a malicious request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized administrator creation: An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into adding a new administrator account, granting the attacker control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious website or link: An attacker can host a malicious webpage with the crafted form or send a link to a victim containing the malicious request.
- Social engineering: The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious website or clicking the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator of the vulnerable OECMS application into visiting a malicious webpage or following a crafted URL.
