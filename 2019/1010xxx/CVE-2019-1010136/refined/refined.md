Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** While the provided content does not directly reference CVE-2019-1010136, it describes a vulnerability in a "PLC Wireless Router GPN2.4P21-C-CN", which was assigned the EDB-ID 45187. It's possible this EDB entry may relate to the specified CVE, however, since the CVE description is not available, it's not possible to confirm.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of authentication on the web interface of the PLC Wireless Router, specifically on the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated access:** The router does not require authentication to access the `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint, allowing anyone with network access to send requests to this endpoint.
- **Remote Reboot Functionality:** The `webproc` endpoint handles reboot requests via the parameters in the HTTP POST data. By sending a modified request, an attacker can trigger an unauthenticated reboot.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The impact of this vulnerability is a Denial of Service. By forcing the device to reboot, an attacker can disrupt network connectivity for users relying on the PLC wireless router.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote Network Access:** Attackers exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the router's `/cgi-bin/webproc` endpoint. The attack is performed remotely over the network, requiring no local access to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable PLC wireless router. This could be either on the same local network or remotely, depending on the router's configuration and internet accessibility.
- **HTTP Request Sending Tool:** The attacker needs a tool capable of sending HTTP POST requests with the specific parameters. This can easily be done using scripting languages such as Python with libraries such as "requests".

**Additional Information:**
The provided exploit code in the Exploit-DB entry demonstrates how to leverage this vulnerability. It takes the target IP address from the user, constructs the POST request with the specific parameters, and sends the request to the vulnerable endpoint.
