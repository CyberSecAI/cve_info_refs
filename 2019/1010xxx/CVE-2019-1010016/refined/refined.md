Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper validation of the `id` parameter obtained using the `GETPOST('id')` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page, which are then reflected back to the user.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session when they visit the affected page.
*   **Data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities:** This could allow the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including stealing sensitive information, redirecting users, or compromising their session.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code through the `id` parameter in the URL.
*   **GET Request:** The vulnerable parameter is accessed via HTTP GET requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to craft a URL with a malicious `id` parameter.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click on the malicious URL. This could be achieved by phishing or other social engineering tactics.

**Technical details:**

*   The specific vulnerable code example is provided:
    ```
    dolibarr-6.0.4/htdocs/product/stats/card.php?id=lol"> <script> alert ( 123 ) </script>
    ```
*   The vulnerability is reported to exist in multiple modules.
