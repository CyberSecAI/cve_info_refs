The provided content discusses security fixes in GLPI version 9.3.1 and shows the source code for `getDropdownValue.php` from the GLPI repository, but does not contain any information about a specific vulnerability that would be associated with CVE-2019-1010307.

The release notes mention "Some security fixes on SQL queries and HTTP headers" but do not provide specific details about the fixed vulnerabilities.

The `getDropdownValue.php` file implements an AJAX endpoint to retrieve dropdown values and contains code to prevent direct access to the file which suggests a potential security concern being addressed here, but it's not explicitly linked to any specific CVE.

Therefore, I will respond with:

NOINFO
