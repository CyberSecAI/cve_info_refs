| Is it possible to backport this to 0.3.x series? According to crates.io stats, half of the recent downloads of rust-yaml are in the 0.3.x.  If this fix is already backported, please let me know and I'll update the [security advisory](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/master/crates/yaml-rust/RUSTSEC-2018-0006.toml). |

| [@Shnatsel](https://github.com/Shnatsel) Most of the rust-yaml downloads are due to clap, which isn't really affected by this issue, making this mostly unimportant. |

| There is a total of 165 crates on crates.io currently affected without a semver-compatible upgrade path, according to [crates-audit](https://gitlab.com/zachreizner/crates-audit). So it might not be as unimportant as it seems. |

| Here's the list of affected crates, without crates depending on `clap`, sorted by recent download count: <https://ncry.pt/p/vzOn#8UqV4ktfnn67-ReSMfvj-xjFZQq1wdDh3uUzK8AhxBk> That's 51 crates, nothing really critical at the top of the list as far as I can tell. |
