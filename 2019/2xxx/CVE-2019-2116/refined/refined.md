Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `sdpu_get_len_from_type` function within the Bluetooth subsystem. Specifically, the lack of a boundary check in this function could lead to an out-of-bounds (OOB) read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is the potential for an OOB read due to missing boundary checks in the `sdpu_get_len_from_type` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure (ID):**  As indicated in the Android Security Bulletin, successful exploitation could lead to an information disclosure vulnerability. An attacker might be able to read sensitive information from memory beyond the intended boundaries.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would likely involve sending specially crafted Bluetooth packets that would trigger the vulnerable code path in `sdpu_get_len_from_type` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Proximity:** An attacker would need to be within Bluetooth range of a vulnerable device.
- **Bluetooth interaction:** The attacker would need the capability to initiate a Bluetooth connection or interaction that would cause the vulnerable function to be called.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit log from android.googlesource.com confirms the fix adds a boundary check to the  `sdpu_get_len_from_type` function to prevent the potential OOB read.
- The associated bug ID is 117105007.
- The Android Security Bulletin indicates this vulnerability is rated as "High" severity and falls under "Information Disclosure."

In summary, CVE-2019-2116 describes an information disclosure vulnerability due to a missing boundary check in a Bluetooth function. This could allow a nearby attacker to read sensitive data by exploiting an OOB read condition.
