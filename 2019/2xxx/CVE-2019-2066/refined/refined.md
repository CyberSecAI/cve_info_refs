*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  The document does not specify the impact of this individual CVE. However, it's implied that the impact could be significant given the large number of vulnerabilities in the libxaac component which included RCE, EoP, ID and DoS vulnerabilities, leading to potential remote code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The specific attack vector isn't detailed for CVE-2019-2066 in this document, but based on the component it would likely involve processing a specially crafted audio file or stream.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker would likely need to provide a malformed input (e.g. audio file) to a system utilizing the vulnerable libxaac library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The libxaac library was removed from production Android builds in November 2018, indicating that these vulnerabilities are primarily of concern for older Android versions.
*   The document mentions that researchers were acknowledged for their findings, meaning this vulnerability was discovered and reported externally, and not internally.

**Summary**

CVE-2019-2066 is one of a large group of vulnerabilities identified in the libxaac library in Android 9. While the specific vulnerability type for this CVE is not provided in the document, other listed vulnerabilities indicate a range of risks, including remote code execution, privilege escalation, information disclosure and denial of service.

It is worth noting that the document mentions that the library has been removed from production builds since November 2018.
