  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `sdpu_get_len_from_type` function due to a missing boundary check.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "A potential out-of-bounds read could allow a malicious actor to access sensitive data or cause a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed, but it involves exploiting the vulnerable `sdpu_get_len_from_type` function.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path, which likely involves providing specific input to the function. The necessary permissions or level of access are not detailed."
