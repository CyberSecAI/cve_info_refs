The provided content is related to CVE-2019-2389.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect scoping of kill operations in MongoDB Server's packaged SysV init scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The init scripts use a PID file to identify the process to be killed. However, they do not validate that the process identified by the PID in the file is indeed the MongoDB process, allowing any process to be terminated if its PID is placed in the file. Specifically, the scripts don't validate that `(${procname})` is the process' command name.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Users with write access to the PID file can insert arbitrary PIDs, which will be killed when the root user stops the MongoDB process via SysV init. This allows an attacker to terminate arbitrary processes on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves manipulating the PID file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires write access to the MongoDB PID file.
