Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2198:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

   The provided content directly references "Bug: 135270103" and "Bug: 135269143", which are associated with CVE-2019-2198 in the Android Security Bulletin.  The code changes described are directly related to mitigating the vulnerability.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

   The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `SQLiteQueryBuilder` class allowing the use of untrusted input in subqueries, specifically within the `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses. This untrusted input could leak side-channel information due to the way SQLite handles "expr" values.  It also affects column names in `ContentValues`. 

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Side-channel Information Leak:** Malicious callers could potentially leak side-channel information by crafting subqueries with "expr" values.
*   **Untrusted Input in SQL:** The `SQLiteQueryBuilder` class didn't have proper restrictions on the columns and clauses allowed in queries, leading to the potential use of untrusted input.
*   **Lack of Strictness:**  The class did not enforce strict validation on column names, allowing malicious data to be used.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data through side-channel attacks.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The vulnerability could allow attackers to manipulate data in unintended ways due to the lack of strict control over the SQL queries.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to extract information or manipulate data.
*   **Untrusted Input:**  The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious SQL queries with untrusted inputs.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Application:** The attacker needs to be able to install and execute a malicious application on the device.
*   **Ability to Construct Malicious Queries:**  The attacker needs the ability to construct specific SQL queries that exploit the vulnerability in `SQLiteQueryBuilder`.

**Technical Details from Commits:**

*   **Commit 07d6f1fe094b6dbde854fb82ada06e85d7a97ecd:** Introduced `setStrictGrammar()` method to prevent subqueries in WHERE and HAVING clauses, and to validate column names used in GROUP BY and ORDER BY. Also added `setStrictColumns()` to validate column names in general.
*   **Commit a57034dfe0afd6d7e6877520fcaa1728e6be90a1:** Further refines the fix.
*   **Commit 13f49c42599dc2ea0be376be34275aefcb70d398:** Further restricts usage of `SQLiteQueryBuilder`

**Mitigation:**

The fix involves the following:

*   **`setStrictGrammar()`**: This method restricts the use of subqueries in `WHERE` and `HAVING` clauses, and enforces that `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses only use valid columns.
*   **`setStrictColumns()`**: This method ensures that all column names are valid, preventing the use of untrusted column names.
*   **Removal of Legacy Code**: Legacy code related to tokenization was removed, relying instead on the robust SQLite tokenizer.

In summary, CVE-2019-2198 is an information disclosure vulnerability due to improper handling of user-controlled inputs in `SQLiteQueryBuilder`, leading to potential side-channel leaks. It is mitigated by introducing strict validation methods and removing legacy logic.
