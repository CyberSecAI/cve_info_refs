Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2047:

**CVE-2019-2047**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `libpac` library, specifically due to a type confusion issue. The code was generating transition elements from stable maps which could lead to issues when the map was updated, causing it to be marked as stable again.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Type confusion within the proxy resolver component (`libpac`). This occurs because the system incorrectly handles stable transitions when maps are updated.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** This vulnerability could lead to remote code execution within the context of a privileged process. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this flaw.

*   **Attack Vectors:** A remote attacker can trigger this vulnerability by using a specially crafted PAC file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PAC file that triggers the type confusion in `libpac`.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) with the fix being linked to commit `8279c47df01ac6dc28d67c411dfa36c61a068c62`.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" in severity.
*   The vulnerability impacts Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 9.
