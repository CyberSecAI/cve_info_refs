Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2228:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an incorrect bounds check within the CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System) when handling language values, specifically in the `ippSetValueTag` function in `cups/ipp.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read**: The incorrect bounds check allows for a potential out-of-bounds read.
- **Information disclosure**: The out-of-bounds read can lead to local information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: A local attacker could potentially cause CUPS to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure**: A local attacker could obtain sensitive information via out-of-bounds read.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing specially crafted language values that bypass the incorrect bounds check. This is related to how CUPS processes IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A local attacker is required, meaning they need to have some level of access to the system where CUPS is running. They could be a user with limited privileges, or an attacker who has already gained a foothold on the system.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was patched in CUPS version 2.1.3-4ubuntu0.11 for Ubuntu 16.04.
- Patches were also released for other versions of Ubuntu as part of USN-4340-1.
- Debian also released a fix for this issue in version 1.7.5-11+deb8u7.
- The Android security bulletin also lists this vulnerability with reference A-111210196
