Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2196:

*   **Relates to CVE:** YES
*   **Vulnerability Description:** Malicious callers can leak side-channel information by using subqueries in any untrusted inputs where SQLite allows "expr" values. Specifically, this vulnerability involves the potential for side-channel information leakage due to malicious use of subqueries within SQLite queries.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the SQLiteQueryBuilder component, where malicious callers could potentially craft subqueries within untrusted inputs, leading to side-channel information leakage.
*   **Weakness:** Untrusted inputs are not properly sanitized or restricted, allowing malicious subqueries to be injected into SQLite queries. SQLite allows "expr" values in subqueries.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious application could craft specific SQLite queries with subqueries to extract sensitive information through side channels. This could be achieved by exploiting the "expr" values allowed by SQLite in untrusted inputs.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure: An attacker could potentially glean sensitive information from the system through side-channel attacks.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves using `setStrictColumns()` and `setStrictGrammar()` on `SQLiteQueryBuilder` to block this class of attacks. It prevents subqueries in WHERE and HAVING clauses and requires GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to be composed only of valid columns. This change also offers `setStrictColumns()` to require that all untrusted column names are valid.
*   **Additional notes:** The fix also removes legacy Lexer code and relies on the SQLiteTokenizer logic.
