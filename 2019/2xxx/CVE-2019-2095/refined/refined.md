Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-2095:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a race condition within the Skia graphics library when handling listeners and drawing paths or bitmaps. This race condition can lead to a use-after-free condition.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to potential corruption and unpredictable behavior.
- **Race Condition:** Multiple threads trying to access and modify shared resources resulting in an unexpected outcome.
- **Lack of Thread Safety:** The listener lists were not properly protected by a mutex, resulting in the race condition and use-after-free issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As stated in the bulletin, this vulnerability could enable a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, indicating the potential for complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted file, which would likely be an image or media file that leverages Skia for rendering or processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote because the vulnerability is triggered by parsing a file, indicating that the attacker doesn't need local access to the device.
- **Crafting a Specific File:** The attacker must be able to craft a specific file that triggers the race condition within Skia.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves making the listener lists thread-safe using a mutex, which prevents the race condition and the use-after-free vulnerability.
- The fix was cherry-picked from an earlier Skia commit.
- The vulnerability is considered a critical issue, indicating its potential for severe impact.
