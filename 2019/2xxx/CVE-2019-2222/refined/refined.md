Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2222:

**CVE-2019-2222**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `libhevc` library, specifically when decoding multiple Sequence Parameter Sets (SPS) with the same ID, and potentially overwriting an existing SPS. This could cause a size check failure for a Coded Tree Block (CTB).

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process, if the decoder state is not handled properly after detecting an overwritten SPS.
    *   **Improper Handling of SPS Overwrites:** The core issue is the lack of proper handling when an SPS is overwritten, which leads to incorrect CTB size calculations.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Critical RCE (Android 8.0, 8.1, 9):** On older Android versions, successful exploitation could lead to critical RCE within a privileged process, potentially granting the attacker complete control of the device.
    *   **Moderate RCE (Android 10):** On Android 10, the impact is considered moderate, suggesting that while RCE is still possible, it might be more restricted or require more complex exploitation techniques.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specially Crafted File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious HEVC file that contains specific sequences of SPS packets.
    *   **Remote Attack:** Since the vulnerability exists within a media framework, a remote attacker can trigger the issue by sending or providing the malicious file to a vulnerable device.

*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to get the vulnerable device to process the crafted HEVC file. This could be through a variety of attack vectors (MMS, downloaded file, etc).
    *  The attacker does not require any special privileges or access before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit message from the AOSP code search confirms that the vulnerability involves checking the CTB size when decoding multiple SPS with the same ID, and the fix prevents potential issues related to SPS overwriting.
*   The fix is described as a check to ensure that if an SPS is overwritten the CTB size remains the same. If the sizes differ, the decoder should reset.

In summary, CVE-2019-2222 is a remote code execution vulnerability that arises from improper handling of HEVC SPS packets within the libhevc library. The severity is critical for Android versions 8.0, 8.1, and 9 and moderate for Android 10. An attacker can trigger the vulnerability with a specially crafted media file.
