Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2011:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-2011

**Description:** Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability in the System component of Android.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in `libhwbinder`. The provided commits indicate issues with how native handles are serialized and deserialized. Specifically, the code didn't properly verify the size of the `native_handle` being received, potentially leading to out-of-bounds errors.

**Weakness:**
*   Improper size validation of `native_handle` during deserialization.

**Attack Vector:** A local malicious application could exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to a local malicious application gaining elevated privileges within the system.

**Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a local malicious application.

**Technical Details (from the commits):**

*   **Commit 8708d35d64df1499edeab1c211ee3d769427cc60:** Deserializes a `native_handle` safely by verifying the size.
*   **Commit 20ac1203a3201ac3e6d05a19325f5569033f3d08:** Exports the maximum number of fds/ints in a native\_handle, presumably for size validation during deserialization.

This information provides more detail than a simple CVE description by explaining the location of the vulnerability, the nature of the vulnerability (size validation), and the specific code changes that address the issue.
