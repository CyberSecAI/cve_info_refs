CVE-2019-2131:
- Root cause of vulnerability: The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the "App notification settings" are handled within the Android Settings application. Specifically, it involves improper handling of the "draw on top" permission. 
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists due to an issue with how the "draw on top" permission is handled in the app notification settings. This allows for a bypass of user interaction requirements, potentially granting unintended access to additional permissions.
- Impact of exploitation: A local attacker could leverage this vulnerability to bypass user interaction requirements and gain access to additional permissions, potentially escalating their privileges on the device.
- Attack vectors: The vulnerability is locally exploitable through a malicious application targeting the application notification settings functionality.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: A local attacker needs to have the capability to install and run a malicious application on the targeted device.
