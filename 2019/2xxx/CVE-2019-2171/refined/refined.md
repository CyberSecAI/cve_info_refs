Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-2171:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2019-2171
**Component:** libxaac
**Type:** Not specified (but the document implies a memory corruption issue given the surrounding CVEs)
**Severity:** Not specified (but it's part of a list of CVEs for a library that was marked as experimental and removed from production builds)

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document states that the libxaac library was experimental and removed from production builds and lists CVE-2019-2171 as part of a list of security issues that were discovered in this library. The specific root cause is not detailed in the document, but is likely related to memory corruption issues, based on surrounding CVEs like heap-based buffer overflows or use-after-free conditions, as those are common vulnerabilities in media libraries like libxaac.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The document only indicates that this vulnerability exists in libxaac but does not specify the vulnerability type. Given the context, it is likely to be a memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The document does not specifically detail the impact of exploiting this specific vulnerability but states that the library was removed from production builds, suggesting it could potentially lead to a variety of issues like remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through processing of a crafted AAC audio file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious or malformed audio file to be processed by the vulnerable libxaac library. User interaction would be required to trigger this if it is part of a media processing chain initiated by a user.

**Additional Notes:**
- libxaac library was removed in November 2018.
- The issues were identified by researchers and acknowledged by the Android security team.
- The document does not provide full technical details.
