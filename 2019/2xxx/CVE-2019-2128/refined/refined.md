Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a result of a double free error within the `ContentEncoding` component.

*   Additionally, there's a separate issue concerning out-of-bounds (OOB) write in `ACELP_4t64_fx`. Specifically, when iterating over an array in `ACELP_4t64_fx`, an index is checked against array size to prevent an out-of-bounds write. However, this check was not previously present or was insufficient, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Double Free:** The code attempts to free the same memory twice, leading to memory corruption.
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** When handling the `ACELP_4t64_fx` encoding, the code can write outside the boundaries of the allocated array.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The double free vulnerability and out of bounds write, when successfully exploited, can lead to an elevation of privilege within the context of a privileged process.
*  **Remote Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated for this specific CVE, double frees can be leveraged for remote code execution as stated within the Android Security Bulletin

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially crafted content**: The content indicates that the vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted content.

*   **Local Exploitation:** This attack vector involves a malicious application running locally on the device. The application can exploit the vulnerability in the media framework by sending the crafted content

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** For elevation of privilege, the attacker needs to have a malicious application installed and running on the target device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided source code commit messages are brief, but they highlight that the fixes involve preventing double frees and adding index checks to avoid out-of-bounds writes in the `ACELP_4t64_fx` function.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
*   The fix for the double free is linked to the AOSP commit: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/90292b7e24b168244d86945ff208d9b26666ba49](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/90292b7e24b168244d86945ff208d9b26666ba49)
*   The fix for the OOB write is linked to the AOSP commit: [https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/d750e00d6268197aa6f3438f87f5968bab86884b](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/av/%2B/d750e00d6268197aa6f3438f87f5968bab86884b)
