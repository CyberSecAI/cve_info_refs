Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2118:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check for proper permissions when accessing user and password fields in the APN (Access Point Name) database. This occurs when applications query the APN database and filter on these fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of adequate permission checks before allowing access to user and password fields in the APN database. This bypasses the intended security mechanisms that should restrict access to sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A malicious application, without the correct permissions, could potentially access sensitive user and password information stored within the APN database. This information could then be misused.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Application:** A malicious app installed on the device could exploit this vulnerability.
- **APN Database Query:** The attack involves querying the APN database and filtering results using the user or password fields, thereby triggering the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the Android device.
- **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need root or other elevated privileges.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix introduces a check to ensure that an app has the proper permissions before accessing APN data.
- The fix for this vulnerability was backported and applied across multiple Android versions (8.0, 8.1, and 9).
- The change was made in the `libhwbinder` component of the Android system.
- The provided information does not indicate if this vulnerability was actively exploited.
