Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2050:

**CVE Description:** The Android Security Bulletin describes this as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP) vulnerability in the System component, specifically in `wificond`.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises because the `ScannerImpl.invalidate()` call does not reset the `|valid_|` field. This can lead to unexpected behavior when calls are made on that instance after `invalidate()` has been invoked. In the context of updates to Android Verified Reboot Challenge Protection (AVRCP) devices, if a device disconnects right before an update message is queued, the device becomes null. Subsequently, a crash occurs when the callback for the update executes on the disconnected device.

**Vulnerability:**
*   Improper state management: The `invalidate()` function in `ScannerImpl` fails to properly reset the `valid_` field.
*   Use-after-free: In the context of AVRCP updates, a callback might execute on a disconnected (and thus deallocated) device, leading to a crash.

**Impact:** A local attacker could potentially elevate their privileges. In the specific case of the bug described in the provided text, a crash would occur.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   For the `ScannerImpl` issue, repeatedly toggling the Wi-Fi state might trigger the unexpected behavior.
*   For the AVRCP issue, disconnecting a device right before an update message is queued triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
*   For the `ScannerImpl` vulnerability, the attacker likely needs the ability to toggle the Wi-Fi state or otherwise interact with the affected `ScannerImpl` instance.
*   For the AVRCP vulnerability, the attacker would need to be able to cause a disconnection at a precise moment during the update process.

**Patch:** The patch for the `ScannerImpl` issue involves modifying `invalidate()` to properly reset the `valid_` field. The patch for the AVRCP issue involves switching the device reference from being Unretained to using a weak pointer. This ensures that the callback doesn't execute if the device disconnects.
