Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2386:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper invalidation of authorization sessions in MongoDB Server. Specifically, after a user is deleted, their existing session is not immediately revoked. If a new user is created with the same name as the deleted user, the old, still active session becomes associated with the new account, allowing access to the database with the privileges of the original user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Session Revocation:**  MongoDB fails to properly invalidate existing sessions upon user deletion.
*   **Session Reuse:** The system allows a previously established session to be reused with a new user that reuses the deleted user's name, effectively granting access with the old user's privileges.
*   **Improper Authentication:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication controls through the reuse of an established session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Persistent Access:** An attacker can maintain access to a MongoDB server even after the original user account is deleted, provided the username is reused.
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** The attacker can perform unauthorized actions on the database with the privileges associated with the original user, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, it could be argued that if an attacker has access to a lower privileged user account, and this user account is deleted and recreated with higher privileges, the attacker could potentially escalate their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the MongoDB server.
*   **Previous User Session:** The attacker must have had a previously established and valid session with a user account before that account is deleted.
*   **User Re-creation:** An administrator must subsequently create a new user account that uses the same username as the deleted user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must initially have valid credentials for a user on the MongoDB server.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the MongoDB server over the network.
*   **Knowledge of User Deletion and Re-creation:** The attacker needs knowledge or expectation of an administrator deleting and then re-creating a user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects MongoDB Server versions prior to 4.0.9, 3.6.13, and 3.4.22.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-287, Improper Authentication.
*   The Talos report includes a detailed proof-of-concept exploit using the `mongo` shell utility.
*   Mitigation includes restarting nodes after user deletion to revoke sessions and avoiding re-creating users with the same name as deleted accounts.
*   The Jira entry notes that this is a "Major Change" with backports requested for v4.0, v3.6, and v3.4.
