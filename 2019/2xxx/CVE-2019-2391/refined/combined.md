[v1.1.4](/mongodb/js-bson/tree/v1.1.4)

[`6e782da`](/mongodb/js-bson/commit/6e782dac6a110509097077ee5edd311977f32522)

The MongoDB Node.js team is pleased to announce version 1.1.4 of the `bson` module!

This patch release resolves an issue with BSON serialization with invalid `_bsontype`, originally reported by [@xiaofen9](https://github.com/xiaofen9). MongoDB will be issuing a CVE for this vulnerability, and we recommend that all users pin their version of the `bson` module to 1.1.4 or higher.

## Release Notes

### Bug

* [[NODE-2514](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE-2514)] - BSON serialization ignores unknown \_bsontype
