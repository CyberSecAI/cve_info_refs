    "description": "The vulnerability in this section could enable a local attacker with privileged access to gain access to sensitive data.",
    "root_cause": "The AES-256 keystore master keys were not being encrypted by the user's password. While these keys are also encrypted by Keymaster in the TEE or StrongBox, the lack of password encryption exposes them to local attackers with privileged access.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker with privileged access could gain access to sensitive data by obtaining the unencrypted AES-256 keystore master keys.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs privileged access to the device.",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability exists because a change added support for AES-256 master keys, but inadvertently caused them not to be encrypted by the user's password."
