### CVE-2019-2036
The provided text relates to CVE-2019-2036.
Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Bluetooth module incorrectly storing BLE keys.
*   **Root Cause:** The system was reading the peer address from the pairing control block instead of `btif_dm_ble_auth_cmpl_evt` when storing BLE keys, leading to keys being stored with an incorrect address.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker could potentially gain access to additional permissions using a specially crafted transmission.
*   **Impact:** Elevation of Privilege.
*   **Affected Versions:** Android 8.0, 8.1, 9, 10.
*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves reading the peer address from `btif_dm_ble_auth_cmpl_evt` instead of the pairing control block in `btif_dm_save_ble_bonding_keys`.
