Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2053:

**CVE-2019-2053**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `wnm_parse_neighbor_report_elem` function within `wpa_supplicant/wnm_sta.c`. This function is responsible for parsing neighbor report elements in Wi-Fi network management frames.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from an insufficient bounds check when parsing the neighbor report element, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability to achieve information disclosure, potentially leaking sensitive data from memory.
*   **Attack Vector:** This vulnerability can be exploited by a nearby attacker who can transmit specially crafted Wi-Fi network management frames.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be within range of a vulnerable device and able to transmit malicious Wi-Fi frames.
*   **Patch Information:**
    *   The vulnerability was fixed in AOSP with the commit [040d17d5d835cc4653e47b120e40975fc37fce95](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/wpa_supplicant_8/%2B/040d17d5d835cc4653e47b120e40975fc37fce95)
    *   The fix involves checking for a valid neighbor report before proceeding with parsing.
