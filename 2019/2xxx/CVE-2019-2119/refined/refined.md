Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a concurrency issue within the Android Keystore service. The service was initially designed with the assumption that its dispatcher thread was single-threaded. However, the Wi-Fi keystore service calls into the Keystore service concurrently. This assumption breaks when the keystore service is called concurrently from both binder and hwbinder threads due to the Wi-Fi keystore service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Concurrency Issue:** The core weakness is the lack of proper synchronization in the Keystore service, specifically when handling calls from multiple threads. 
- **Incorrect Assumption:** The service incorrectly assumed that its operations would always be serialized by the dispatcher thread.
- **Lack of Thread Safety:** The Keystore service was not designed to be thread-safe, leading to potential race conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  The CVE description classifies this as an "Information Disclosure" vulnerability. The provided text indicates that the specific impact is not detailed, but a lack of synchronization can cause unexpected behavior and data races.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the Android Keystore service, specifically when the Wi-Fi keystore service interacts with it.
- An attacker could potentially trigger concurrent calls to the Keystore service through the Wi-Fi service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need the ability to cause the Wi-Fi keystore service to interact with the Keystore service concurrently. 
- This might involve some control over network configurations or the ability to initiate Wi-Fi related actions.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding a lock around all Keystore service entry points to ensure that dispatcher executions are serialized, even when called from binder and hwbinder threads.
- This vulnerability highlights a common pitfall in multi-threaded programming: assumptions about single-threaded execution can lead to concurrency issues and exploitable vulnerabilities.
