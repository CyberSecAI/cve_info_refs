Based on the provided text, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2019-2032
*   **Description:** In `btm_ble_multi_adv`, the maximum size of scan response and advertising packet data length should be `BTM_BLE_AD_DATA_LEN` (31).
*   **Vulnerability:** The code does not properly check the data length in the HCI interface for BLE advertising, potentially leading to a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issues.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious Bluetooth device could send advertising packets with a length exceeding the expected maximum.
*   **Impact:** Elevation of Privilege.
*   **Root Cause:** Lack of data length validation in the Bluetooth module when handling advertising data.
*   **Affected Versions:** 8.0, 8.1, 9

The second commit addresses a use-after-free vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Use after free in `btm_proc_smp_cbak()` by returning after `p_dev_rec` is freed to prevent use after free.
*   **Attack Vector:** Connect to an LE device and wait for a timeout.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption or potentially arbitrary code execution.
