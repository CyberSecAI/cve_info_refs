Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2211:

**CVE-2019-2211**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the `TvProvider` component. The provided commit message "Add SafetyNet logging to Tvprovider" suggests the vulnerability may be related to how the TvProvider handles certain operations, possibly involving data validation or access control, which requires additional logging for security review. 
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The provided information indicates an "ID" type vulnerability, which stands for Information Disclosure. This suggests that the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information. The commit message also reveals a lack of proper logging that could have exposed the vulnerability during development, therefore, it is possible that the root cause is related to insecure data handling that might leak sensitive information if not properly validated or protected.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. This information could then be used for further attacks or to compromise user privacy.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector appears to be through the `TvProvider` component. The description mentions that the vulnerability is related to how the component handles data, which suggests a malicious application could manipulate the input or state to trigger the information disclosure. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would likely need to have a malicious application installed on the device. This would grant them the capability to interact with the `TvProvider` and exploit the information disclosure vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The commit messages and the security bulletin provide more details regarding the specific files affected and the general area of the vulnerability than the generic CVE description.
*   The issue was addressed in AOSP versions 8.0, 8.1, 9, and 10.
