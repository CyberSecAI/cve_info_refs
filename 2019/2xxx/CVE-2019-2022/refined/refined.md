Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2022:

**CVE-2019-2022**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read in `rw_t3t_update_block()` function within the NFC component. This likely stems from insufficient validation of input data, leading to the function attempting to read memory outside of the intended bounds.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (information disclosure).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Information disclosure. Although the severity is marked as "High", the direct impact is information leakage, which may enable further attacks.
*  **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is located in the NFC component. An attacker would need to interact with the NFC functionality in a way that triggers the vulnerable function with malicious inputs. 
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to transmit/present a specially crafted NFC data to the targeted device to trigger the vulnerable code path and perform an out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided AOSP commit message confirms the vulnerability: "Prevent OOB read in `rw_t3t_update_block()`.
* The vulnerability is classified as an "ID" (Information Disclosure) type of vulnerability.
*   Multiple commits were cherry-picked to address this vulnerability along with other related vulnerabilities, indicating a likely larger problem within the same area of the NFC module.
* This vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9, as listed in the security bulletin.
