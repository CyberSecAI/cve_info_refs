Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-2107:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `libhevc` library, specifically during the processing of HEVC video files. It involves a missing bounds check on parameters within the Supplemental Picture Set (SPS) of the HEVC bitstream. Specifically, the parameters `log2_min_coding_block_size_minus3`, `log2_diff_max_min_coding_block_size`, `log2_min_transform_block_size_minus2` and `log2_diff_max_min_transform_block_size` were not properly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Bounds Check:** The core issue is the absence of proper validation on certain parameters read from the HEVC bitstream. This allows for specially crafted values that, when processed, lead to an out-of-bounds read or write.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process by exploiting the missing bounds check using a malicious video file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system. This means the attacker can potentially take complete control of the device, access sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious activities.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The exploit can cause the VideoPlayer or media framework to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Specially Crafted Video File:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious HEVC video file. This file could be delivered through various means, such as:
    *   Websites
    *   Email attachments
    *   Messaging apps
    *   Other media sharing platforms

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafting Malicious HEVC File:** The attacker needs the ability to create an HEVC video file with specific parameter values in the SPS.
*   **Delivery of Malicious File:** The attacker must deliver the malicious file to the vulnerable device or user. The attacker doesn't need a direct network connection to the victim, as the file can be delivered through various vectors.
*   **User Interaction:** The user needs to attempt to play the crafted video file.

**Additional Details:**

*   **"Hevcfright":** The vulnerability is nicknamed "Hevcfright", referencing the earlier "Stagefright" vulnerabilities in Android's media framework due to its similar nature of exploiting media processing.
*   **Affected Versions:** Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9 without the July 2019 security patch are affected.
*   **Patch Information:** The vulnerability is fixed in the July 2019 Android security patch. The fix is present in the AOSP commit `af17238b90c34bd466f01e7f9b999d3a28844cbe`, which adds proper bounds checks.

In summary, CVE-2019-2107 is a critical vulnerability that allows for remote code execution through a specially crafted HEVC video file, impacting a wide range of Android devices prior to the July 2019 security patch.
