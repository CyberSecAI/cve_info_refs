Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue related to how `libbinder` handles data positioning and string reading when processing inter-process communication (IPC) in Android. Specifically, it involves a flaw in how `readCString` calculates and validates data positions, and a lack of overflow protection in `readString`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Data Position Check:** The `libbinder` component does not correctly validate data positions during IPC data reading (specifically during the reading of strings). This flaw leads to information disclosure because out-of-bounds data can be accessed
*   **Missing Sub-Overflow Protection:** There is no sub-overflow protection in `readString`, causing an integer underflow. This leads to an out-of-bounds read, which can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Improper validation**: The `checkDataPosition` check has been updated to account for the potential sub-overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information. Because the vulnerability is related to improper bounds checking when reading strings during inter-process communication, an attacker could read information that should not be accessible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through inter-process communication (IPC). A malicious process could craft a specific binder transaction that triggers the vulnerability when it's processed by a vulnerable system component, leading to out-of-bounds data access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send malicious IPC messages to a vulnerable system service. This could be accomplished through a compromised application or another process capable of sending binder transactions to the vulnerable component.

**Additional Information:**
*   The fix involves updating the `checkDataPosition` function in `libbinder`, and also adds protection against sub-overflows.
*   The vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 9.
*   The fix was cherry-picked from commit `509e0e02730a609c91282625c50a21f731d0f23d` which can be found here `https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/native/+/509e0e02730a609c91282625c50a21f731d0f23d`.
*   The fix was done in multiple steps, so it can be traced across multiple commits in the android git repos.
