Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2117:

**CVE-2019-2117**

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient permission checks when accessing the APN database. Specifically, applications querying the APN database and filtering based on user or password fields lack the necessary permission to access APN data.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    -  **Information Disclosure (ID):** The primary vulnerability is unauthorized access to sensitive data in the APN database, such as user names and passwords.

* **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious application could potentially access sensitive user or password information stored in the APN database. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the user's network connections or other services relying on this information.

* **Attack Vectors:** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability by querying the APN database while filtering on the user or password fields.

* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - An attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device. The application does not require special privileges and bypass user interaction requirements to gain additional permission.
    - The attacker's application must query the APN database using user or password fields.

**Additional Notes:**
