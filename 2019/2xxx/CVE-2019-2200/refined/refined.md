Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2200:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that a malicious application could float a window on top of the certificate installation dialog, obscuring it. This could trick users into installing a malicious CA certificate.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Window Management:** The system lacked proper restrictions to prevent apps from overlaying critical security dialogs, specifically the certificate installation dialog.
- **Lack of System Flag:** The activity responsible for the certificate installation dialog was missing a flag that would prevent other activities from drawing over it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **User Deception:** An attacker could trick a user into installing a malicious CA certificate by obscuring the legitimate installation dialog, leading to a potential man-in-the-middle attack.
- **Compromise of User Trust:** The user's trust in the security of the device could be undermined due to the successful installation of a malicious certificate.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** A malicious application with the ability to float a window on top of other apps is the primary attack vector. This application could be installed from an app store or side-loaded.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to attempt to install a CA certificate for the attack to succeed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Malicious App Development:** The attacker needs to develop an application that can float a window on top of other windows.
- **App Installation:** The attacker needs to have the malicious application installed on the target device.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to time their window overlay to coincide with the display of the certificate installation dialog.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves adding the `HIDE_NON_SYSTEM_OVERLAY_WINDOWS` flag when the activity is created, which prevents other foreground activities from obscuring the certificate installation dialog.
- The commit message mentions a bug ID (139017101) and a test case (`android.permission.cts.RemovePermissionTest`), which provides a reference point for the vulnerability.
