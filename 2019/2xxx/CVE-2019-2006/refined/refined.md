{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Using 'exit' from an RPC thread pool thread is unsafe, as 'exit' runs atexit handlers that destroy global objects. This can interfere with code still running on other threads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of exit() in a multithreaded environment",
       "Incorrect termination of the process"
    ],
    "impact": "Global objects might be destroyed while other threads are still running, causing unpredictable behavior and potential crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote Procedure Call (RPC) thread pool"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to trigger the `exit()` call within the affected RPC thread pool."
