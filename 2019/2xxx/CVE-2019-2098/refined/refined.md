Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2098:

**CVE-2019-2098**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in how cross-user permission checks are handled specifically related to notifications. The commit message "Add cross user permission check - areNotificationsEnabledForPackage" and code change indicate an improper check was being made related to whether notifications are enabled for a package across different users on the device.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Permission Check:** A local malicious application could potentially exploit a flaw in the cross-user permission check for notifications. This means that an app running under one user context might be able to bypass the intended restrictions related to accessing or controlling another user's notifications.
    *   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By circumventing these checks, an attacker can elevate its privileges and gain access to resources or functionalities it normally wouldn't have, particularly those related to user notification settings.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The primary impact is the elevation of privileges. A malicious app could bypass user interaction requirements to gain access to additional permissions related to notifications. This could lead to:
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Notifications:** An attacker could potentially read or manipulate notifications from other users on the same device, breaching user privacy and potentially stealing sensitive information.
    *   **Disruption of User Experience:** By interfering with notifications, the attacker could cause confusion, denial of service related to notifications, or potentially redirect user interactions.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Malicious Application:** A locally installed malicious application is the primary attack vector.
    *   **Cross-User Interaction:** The vulnerability exists in the handling of cross-user permission checks. Thus the attacker is exploiting the cross-user boundary on the same device.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Locally Installed App:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the user's device.
    *   **Target Android Version:** The vulnerability is known to affect Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1 and 9.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided links to the source code changes show the specific commits that addressed this vulnerability, which gives more detailed information about the code changes involved.
*   The severity is rated as **High**, reflecting that an attacker could achieve significant privilege escalation if they were successful.

In summary, CVE-2019-2098 is a high-severity vulnerability that could allow a malicious local application to bypass permission checks related to cross-user notifications, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user data and disruption of user experience on Android devices.
