Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2124:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a missing initialization of a `Bundle` object. Specifically, in the Android Email app, if `originalExtras` does not exist, an empty `Bundle` was not being created.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is categorized as an Information Disclosure issue. The absence of an initialized `Bundle` can lead to unexpected behavior in the application when it attempts to access or process the extras, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation could lead to the disclosure of information that should not be exposed due to the application not correctly handling the missing bundle. The provided text does not give specifics of what information, but does indicate a "high" severity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local because it involves a vulnerability within the Email application itself. It is not a remote exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the state of the Email application in a way that triggers the specific code path where `originalExtras` is not present and an empty `Bundle` is expected. This may involve crafting a specific email or interaction within the app that reaches the vulnerable code.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix involves adding the line `originalExtras = new Bundle();` to ensure an empty `Bundle` is created when `originalExtras` does not exist.
*   The fix was backported from change `cl/247540041`.
*   The bug is tracked as `127320867` and `135889250` and `127320867`.
*   The fix was tested manually on a Pixel phone, specifically testing the Email UI.
*   The vulnerability is present in Android versions 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
