Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Integer underflow in the `rw_t3t_act_handle_check_ndef_rsp()` function within the NFC component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The code was vulnerable to an integer underflow. This can occur when an arithmetic operation produces a result that is smaller than the minimum value that can be represented by the data type.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The vulnerability could lead to elevation of privilege (EoP). This means a local attacker could gain additional permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker
- The specific attack vector involves triggering the integer underflow in `rw_t3t_act_handle_check_ndef_rsp()`.  This likely happens through crafted input or manipulation of the NFC subsystem, but specific details are not given.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local application with the capability of interacting with the NFC subsystem. User interaction is likely necessary.

**Additional Notes**
- The fix is specifically for an integer underflow within the `rw_t3t_act_handle_check_ndef_rsp()` function.
- The provided commit messages indicate the vulnerability is located in the system/nfc component.
- The security bulletin also mentions that this vulnerability is rated as High severity.
- The affected AOSP versions include: 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
