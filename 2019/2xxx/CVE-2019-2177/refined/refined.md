{
  "CVE-2019-2177": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way HidProfile handles priority when connecting to HidHostService.",
    "Weaknesses": "The HidProfile allows connection to HidHostService even when the priority is PRIORITY_UNDEFINED, which it should not. This results in the input device state toggling on/off unexpectedly when a HID device connects.",
    "Impact": "The impact is that the input device state toggles on and off when a HID device connects.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is connecting a HID device.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to connect a HID device to the system."
