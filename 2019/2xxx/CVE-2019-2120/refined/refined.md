Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how ART (Android Runtime) creates files, specifically not using conservative permissions. This could allow a local attacker to bypass user interaction requirements to gain additional permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect File Permissions:** The core issue lies in the ART component not setting appropriate (conservative) permissions when creating files. This creates an opportunity for unauthorized access.
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The vulnerability is categorized as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP), meaning a local attacker can use it to gain permissions they shouldn't have.
   
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges by bypassing user interaction requirements, leading to unauthorized access to additional resources and permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the device. This could be through a malicious app installed by the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the device, typically achieved by installing a malicious application.
- **Ability to trigger file creation:** The attacker needs to trigger the vulnerable ART behavior to create the file with incorrect permissions.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message `Use conservative permissions when creating files in ART` explicitly highlights the fix applied to address the vulnerability.
- The fix ensures that when ART creates files, they are created with appropriate permissions, limiting the attack surface.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
