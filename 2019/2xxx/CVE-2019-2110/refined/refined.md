Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2110:

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-2110 is an information disclosure vulnerability within the Android Media framework. Specifically, it stems from a flaw in the MPEG4/H.263 decoder. This decoder does not handle increases in frame width correctly, leading to an out-of-bounds access if the width increases mid-stream, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because the MPEG4/H.263 decoder does not properly handle situations where the frame width increases during decoding. While there was a check in place to prevent the total frame size (width * height) from increasing, the decoder itself did not support width increases. This discrepancy leads to out-of-bounds buffer accesses if such a condition occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The decoder attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer when the frame width increases during decoding.
- Incorrect handling of frame size changes: The decoder does not correctly manage changes in frame width, leading to memory access errors.
- Missing support for width increase: The decoder does not support an increase in frame width, even if the height decreases correspondingly.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to read data from memory locations outside the intended buffer. This can leak sensitive data from the application's memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Specially crafted media file: An attacker would need to provide a crafted MPEG4/H.263 file that attempts to increase the frame width mid-stream during decoding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious media file.
- The attacker needs the device to process the crafted file using the vulnerable decoder.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is in the MPEG4/H.263 decoder, which is part of the Android media framework.
- This issue was addressed by changes in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP).
- The fix involves ensuring the decoder doesn't try to access memory outside of its allocated buffer when width increases unexpectedly.
- The provided text includes references to bugs 136175447 and 136173699 which are also related to media framework issues, but CVE-2019-2110 is explicitly linked to bug 69703445.
