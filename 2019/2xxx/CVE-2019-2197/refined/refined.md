## CVE-2019-2197

The provided content relates to CVE-2019-2197. Specifically, the commit message from android.googlesource.com indicates the following:

*   **Vulnerability:** When there are no users' choice to tell whether to share their phonebook information to the Bluetooth device, set the phonebook access permission to `ACCESS_REJECTED`.
*   **Root Cause:** The code was not explicitly setting phonebook access to `ACCESS_REJECTED` when no user choice was available, potentially leading to unintended information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the user's phonebook information via Bluetooth if the system doesn't explicitly reject access when no user choice is made.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure (ID). A Bluetooth device could potentially access the user's phonebook without explicit consent.
*   **Mitigation:** The patch ensures that the phonebook access permission is explicitly set to `ACCESS_REJECTED` when the user has not made a choice about sharing their phonebook information with a Bluetooth device.

The Android Security Bulletin for November 2019 lists CVE-2019-2197 as an Information Disclosure (ID) vulnerability in the Framework component with a severity of High.
