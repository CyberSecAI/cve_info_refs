Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2121:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a race condition during process start-up in the Android system server. When a new process is started with a PID that was previously associated with an old process that has been killed by the OS, the system server might not have finished the cleanup of the old `ProcessRecord`. Consequently, the new process might incorrectly reuse the old process's PID due to the asynchronous nature of the process start-up changes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Race Condition:** The primary weakness is the race condition between the asynchronous `attachApplicationLocked()` and `handleProcessStartedLocked()` functions, along with `mPidsSelfLocked`, which could result in a stale `ProcessRecord` being associated with a new process's PID.
- **Incomplete Cleanup:** Failure to properly clean up the old `ProcessRecord` before reusing a PID.
- **Incorrect PID Association:** The new process uses a PID that still has an old `ProcessRecord` associated with it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability can allow a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker (i.e. a malicious application installed on the device)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to install and run a malicious application on the targeted Android device.
- No network access or user interaction is specified.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit log and security bulletin indicate that this vulnerability exists in Android 9.
- The fix involves cleaning up the old `ProcessRecord` when a PID is reused to prevent the race condition.
