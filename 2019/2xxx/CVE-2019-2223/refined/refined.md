**Relevant Content:**
The provided content includes information related to CVE-2019-2223, specifically a commit message and description related to a fix in `libhevc`.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-2223 is a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the media framework, specifically within `libhevc`. It could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process by using a specially crafted file. The vulnerability is rated as Critical for Android versions 8.0, 8.1 and 9 and Moderate for version 10.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE)
*   **Affected Component:** `libhevc` (HEVC decoder library)
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted file.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of a privileged process.
*   **Root Cause:** The commit messages related to the fix (linked to A-140692129) indicate a problem with how the decoder handles slice headers, potentially leading to use of invalid slice headers and, therefore, memory corruption. Further, it appears that the decoder does not correctly check the change in CTB size when decoding multiple SPS (Sequence Parameter Set) with the same ID. If an SPS is being overwritten, the CTB size must remain the same. Otherwise, the decoder must return and reset the decoder state for the subsequent decode call.
