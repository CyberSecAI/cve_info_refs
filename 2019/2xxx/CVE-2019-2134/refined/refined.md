Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds (OOB) write in the `Mfc_Transceive` function. This likely involves writing data beyond the allocated buffer space.
* The patch prevents OOB write in `phFriNfc_ExtnsTransceive` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The core issue is an OOB write, a classic memory corruption vulnerability. Writing outside of allocated memory can lead to various issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability is classified as an Elevation of Privilege (EoP), meaning a successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain higher privileges than they should have. This could mean the attacker can run arbitrary code within a privileged process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **NFC Interface:** The vulnerability lies within the NFC (Near Field Communication) component of Android and can be triggered through interaction with a Mifare tag. This means a proximate attacker is needed, someone within NFC range of the device.
*   **Mifare Tag Interaction:** The specific attack vector involves a malicious or crafted Mifare tag interaction. The device attempts to read/write the tag, leading to the OOB write.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Proximity:** The attacker needs to be within NFC range of the vulnerable device to trigger the exploit.
*   **Malicious Mifare Tag:** The attacker needs the capability to write/modify a Mifare tag with specific data to trigger the OOB write in the device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided code changes indicate that the vulnerability is fixed by preventing the OOB write in the `phFriNfc_ExtnsTransceive` and `Mfc_Transceive` functions.
*   The vulnerability is triggered during Mifare Tag Read/Write operation.
*   The change is cherry-picked from commit `46d00688b8673d1f8099cb2e07ef7b8cd3e1dc79` and `130a144ee6324a0c433c6b671448c0d14bf2dde1`
