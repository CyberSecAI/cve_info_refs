  "CVE-2019-2127": {
    "description": "The vulnerability in this section could enable a local attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the way AudioInputDescriptor, AudioOutputDescriptor, and AudioSession refer to AudioMix instances. These descriptors were using raw pointers to AudioMix instances, which are owned by AudioPolicyMix. This is unsafe because the descriptors do not control the lifetime of AudioMix. The fix changes these pointers to be weak pointers to the AudioPolicyMix, which reflects the actual relationship.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of raw pointers instead of managed or weak pointers leading to potential dangling pointer issues.",
     "Incorrect object ownership and lifecycle management."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local exploitation by a malicious application"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to run code on the device",
       "Access to audio subsystem"
    ],
    "details": "The fix ensures that code does not operate on AudioMix instances independently from AudioPolicyMix and prevents the need to introduce getter/setter methods in AudioPolicyMix by making the latter inherit from AudioMix, which more accurately represents that AudioPolicyMix is essentially a ref-counted version of AudioMix."
