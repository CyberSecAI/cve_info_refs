Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `libhevc` library, specifically during the parsing of Supplemental Enhancement Information (SEI) messages.
- The root cause is a missing return check or validation of the Short-Term Reference Picture Set (STRP) during the parsing of SEI messages. Specifically, a check for at least one valid SPS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Validation:** The code does not properly check if there is at least one valid SPS (Sequence Parameter Set) present when parsing SEI messages containing short-term reference picture sets.
- **Potential for Out-of-Bounds Access:** Without this check, a crafted SEI message could potentially lead to out-of-bounds reads or writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted file. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
- **Critical Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as critical due to its potential for remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted File:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a malformed file containing a specially crafted SEI message with missing or invalid SPS data.
- **Remote Attacker:** An attacker could send this crafted file to a vulnerable Android device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to deliver a malformed file:** The attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted file to the vulnerable device. This could be through various methods like downloading a file from the internet, sending via messaging apps, or using a media playback app.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure there is at least one valid SPS when parsing SEI messages.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Android 10.
- The vulnerability is present in `libhevc`, which is used for HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding) media decoding.
