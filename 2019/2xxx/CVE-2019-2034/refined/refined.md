CVE-2019-2034:
Root cause of vulnerability:
- A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `DNSServiceRefDeallocate()` function and pointer dereferencing in the request handler thread.
- The `mRef` member of `Element` is deallocated in `DNSServiceRefDeallocate()`. A race condition occurs because the request handler thread may still be dereferencing it.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Use-after-free.
- Race condition.

Impact of exploitation:
- A heap-use-after-free bug leading to arbitrary code execution in a privileged process

Attack vectors:
- A local attacker can trigger the race condition through crafted requests.
- An attacker can trigger the deallocation of `mRef` while another thread is trying to use it, resulting in the use-after-free.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local attacker with the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path and race condition.
