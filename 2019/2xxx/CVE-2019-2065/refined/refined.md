**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The exact impact of exploiting CVE-2019-2065 is not specified, but given the context of other vulnerabilities in the list, the impact could range from elevation of privilege, information disclosure, to denial of service or remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vector isn't mentioned. However, the libxaac library is used for processing audio; therefore, a specially crafted audio file could potentially be an attack vector for exploiting the vulnerability.
    

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would likely need the ability to provide a malicious audio file that triggers the vulnerability in the libxaac library.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The libxaac library was marked as experimental and was removed from production builds starting with the November 2018 Android Security Bulletin. This implies that the library was not intended for production use and was known to be potentially unstable or have security issues.
*   The document mentions that the vulnerabilities in libxaac were acknowledged due to research, suggesting these flaws were discovered through external reporting.
*   The absence of the library in production builds effectively mitigates this vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2019-2065 is one of many vulnerabilities associated with the experimental libxaac library that was removed from Android. The exact details of this specific vulnerability are not provided within the document, but it is part of a group of vulnerabilities considered serious enough to warrant the complete removal of the library.
