Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2182:

**CVE-2019-2182**

*   **Root Cause:** A race condition exists in the arm64 virtual memory management code. Specifically, the `ioremap_page_range` function doesn't properly handle "break-before-make" (BBM) operations when creating huge mappings. It attempts to create huge mappings (using `p*d_set_huge`) over pre-existing table entries without proper checks.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Race Condition:** The core issue is a race condition when setting up memory mappings, specifically when creating huge page mappings on arm64 architecture.
    *   **Missing BBM Enforcement:** The `ioremap_page_range` function lacks proper enforcement of break-before-make semantics, potentially leading to conflicts when huge mappings are created over existing table entries.
    *   **Memory Leak:** The vulnerability can lead to leaking page table memory as well as TLB conflicts.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Due to the race condition, it is possible to disclose sensitive information related to memory mappings and page tables.
    *   **Denial of Service (Crash):** The lack of proper handling of memory mappings can lead to TLB conflicts and spurious aborts causing a system crash.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Potentially):**  The potential for memory corruption from leaked page table memory may be further exploited to achieve privilege escalation.
    *   **Spurious Aborts:** Observed on Cortex-A75, this leads to spurious aborts which can be exploited to trigger a denial of service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is present in the kernel's memory management routines, specifically when `ioremap_page_range` creates huge mappings.
    *  Exploitation would require triggering the vulnerable code path which sets up huge mappings in the kernel

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker would need to trigger the `ioremap_page_range` function with parameters that lead to the vulnerable code path.
    *   Local access or the ability to trigger kernel functions in such a way would be required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit diff shows the fix implemented for this issue. The fix involves adding a check using `pud_present` and `pmd_present` to prevent the creation of huge mappings over existing table entries, thus enforcing break-before-make semantics.
* The vulnerability was reported by multiple sources, including Hanjun Guo and Lei Li.
*   The fix is available in the upstream kernel and various distributions have backported the fix.
*   The android bulletin references the upstream commit for the fix: [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=15122ee2c515a253b0c66a3e618bc7ebe35105eb](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=15122ee2c515a253b0c66a3e618bc7ebe35105eb)
