Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-2097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to a type confusion issue within the `libpac` library. This type confusion arises during the handling of constants in the Proxy Auto-Configuration (PAC) file processing by the V8 JavaScript engine.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:** The core weakness is that the `libpac` library doesn't properly handle the types when processing PAC files. This allows for an attacker to manipulate the types used in the JavaScript engine leading to unexpected behavior.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As a consequence of the type confusion, an attacker can craft a malicious PAC file that will exploit the type confusion and allow them to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process. This could lead to complete control of the affected device, allowing for malicious actions like data theft, malware installation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted PAC File:** The attack vector involves delivering a malicious PAC file to the vulnerable device. This could happen through various means, such as a man-in-the-middle attack on a network connection, or by tricking a user to manually load the malicious PAC file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Attacker:** The attacker can be remote, needing only the ability to deliver a specially crafted PAC file to the device.
- **PAC File Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to create a PAC file designed to trigger the type confusion.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is related to changes made in the upstream Chromium V8 project.
- A specific test case (`/data/local/nativetest/proxy_resolver_v8_unittest/proxy_resolver_v8_unittest`) is mentioned, as well as `GtsGmsCoreHostTestCase`.
- The vulnerability was reported with Bug ID A-117606285.
