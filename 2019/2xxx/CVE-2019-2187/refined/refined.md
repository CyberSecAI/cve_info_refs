Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2187:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-2187

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a length underflow in `NfcTag.cpp`. Specifically, when handling a Type4B tag, the code doesn't properly check the length of data received, leading to a potential underflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer underflow vulnerability in the NFC component when handling Type4B tags. This leads to incorrect memory access when processing NFC data, which could lead to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive information from the device's memory due to the incorrect memory access caused by the length underflow.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is via a specially crafted NFC Type 4B tag that triggers the length underflow in the `NfcTag.cpp` code when the Android device attempts to interact with it.
- A malicious NFC tag is brought within proximity of a vulnerable device to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within NFC range of the vulnerable device.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and deploy a malicious NFC tag containing the specifically crafted data needed to trigger the underflow.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability is available in AOSP versions 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, 9 and 10.
- The associated AOSP commit is  `4ce9d55d26d239571909ed8981519734bcb355be`.
- The bug ID associated with the vulnerability is A-124940143.
- The vulnerability is classified as an Information Disclosure (ID) issue and is rated as High severity.
