# Android Security Bulletin—June 2019

Stay organized with collections

Save and categorize content based on your preferences.

*Published June 3, 2019 | Updated June 5, 2019*

The Android Security Bulletin contains details of security vulnerabilities
affecting Android devices. Security patch levels of 2019-06-05 or higher address all of these
issues. To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[How to check and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705).

Android partners are notified of all issues at least a month before
publication. Source code patches for these issues have been released to the
Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository and linked from this bulletin.
This bulletin also includes links to patches outside of AOSP.

The most severe of these issues is a critical security vulnerability in Media framework that
could enable a remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.
The [severity assessment](/docs/security/overview/updates-resources#severity) is based on the effect that exploiting the
vulnerability would possibly have on an affected device, assuming
the platform and service mitigations are turned off for development
purposes or if successfully bypassed.

We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly
reported issues. Refer to the
[Android and Google service mitigations](#mitigations)
section for details on the
[Android security platform protections](/docs/security/enhancements)
and Google Play Protect, which improve the security of the Android platform.

**Note:** Information on the latest over-the-air (OTA) update and
firmware images for Google devices is available in the
[June 2019
Pixel Update Bulletin](/docs/security/bulletin/pixel/2019-06-01).

## Android and Google service mitigations

This is a summary of the mitigations provided by the
[Android security platform](/docs/security/enhancements)
and service protections such as
[Google Play
Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect). These security enhancements reduce the likelihood that security
vulnerabilities could be successfully exploited on Android.

* Exploitation for many issues on Android is made more difficult by
  enhancements in newer versions of the Android platform. We encourage all users
  to update to the latest version of Android where possible.
* The Android security team actively monitors for abuse through
  [Google Play
  Protect](https://www.android.com/play-protect) and warns users about
  [Potentially
  Harmful Applications](/static/docs/security/reports/Google_Android_Security_PHA_classifications.pdf). Google Play Protect is enabled by default on devices
  with [Google Mobile
  Services](http://www.android.com/gms), and is especially important for users who install apps from
  outside of Google Play.

## 2019-06-01 security patch level vulnerability details

In the sections below, we provide details for each of the security
vulnerabilities that apply to the 2019-06-01 patch level. Vulnerabilities are
grouped under the component they affect. There is a description of the

## Common questions and answers

This section answers common questions that may occur after reading this
bulletin.

**1. How do I determine if my device is updated to address these
issues?**

To learn how to check a device's security patch level, see
[How to check and update your Android version](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/4457705#pixel_phones&nexus_devices).

* Security patch levels of 2019-06-01 or higher address all issues associated
  with the 2019-06-01 security patch level.
* Security patch levels of 2019-06-05 or higher address all issues associated
  with the 2019-06-05 security patch level and all previous patch levels.

Device manufacturers that include these updates should set the patch string
level to:

* `[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2019-06-01]`
* `[ro.build.version.security_patch]:[2019-06-05]`

**2. Why does this bulletin have two security patch levels?**

This bulletin has two security patch levels so that Android partners have the
flexibility to fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all
Android devices more quickly. Android partners are encouraged to fix all issues
in this bulletin and use the latest security patch level.

* Devices that use the 2019-06-01 security patch level must include all
  issues associated with that security patch level, as well as fixes for all
  issues reported in previous security bulletins.
* Devices that use the security patch level of 2019-06-05 or newer must
  include all applicable patches in this (and previous) security
  bulletins.

Partners are encouraged to bundle the fixes for all issues they are addressing
in a single update.

**3. What do the entries in the *Type* column mean?**

Entries in the *Type* column of the vulnerability details table
reference the classification of the security vulnerability.

| Abbreviation | Definition |
| RCE | Remote code execution |
| EoP | Elevation of privilege |
| ID | Information disclosure |
| DoS | Denial of service |
| N/A | Classification not available |

**4. What do the entries in the *References* column mean?**

Entries under the *References* column of the vulnerability details table
may contain a prefix identifying the organization to which the reference value
belongs.

| Prefix | Reference |
| A- | Android bug ID |
| QC- | Qualcomm reference number |
| M- | MediaTek reference number |
| N- | NVIDIA reference number |
| B- | Broadcom reference number |

**5. What does a \* next to the Android bug ID in the *References*
column mean?**

Issues that are not publicly available have a \* next to the Android bug ID in
the *References* column. The update for that issue is generally
contained in the latest binary drivers for Pixel devices
available from the
[Google
Developer site](https://developers.google.com/android/drivers).

**6. Why are security vulnerabilities split between this bulletin and
device / partner security bulletins, such as the
Pixel bulletin?**

Security vulnerabilities that are documented in this security bulletin are
required to declare the latest security patch level on Android
devices. Additional security vulnerabilities that are documented in the
device / partner security bulletins are not required for
declaring a security patch level. Android device and chipset manufacturers
may also publish security vulnerability details specific to their products,
such as [Google](/security/bulletin/pixel), [Huawei](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/bulletin/), [LGE](https://lgsecurity.lge.com/security_updates_mobile.html),
[Motorola](https://support.motorola.com/us/en/softwareupgrade),
[Nokia](https://www.nokia.com/phones/en_int/security-updates),
or [Samsung](https://security.samsungmobile.com/securityUpdate.smsb).
