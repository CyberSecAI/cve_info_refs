Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2102:

**CVE-2019-2102**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a misconfiguration in the Bluetooth pairing protocols of a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) version of FIDO Security Keys. This allows the interception of Bluetooth traffic during pairing.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insecure Bluetooth connections during the pairing process of BLE FIDO security keys. Specifically a vulnerability in the Bluetooth pairing protocols of certain BLE devices.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with physical proximity can intercept Bluetooth traffic during pairing, potentially compromising the security of the FIDO security key and the devices it's paired with.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Physical proximity to the vulnerable device.
    *   Intercepting Bluetooth traffic during pairing of the insecure security key.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be in close physical proximity to the devices initiating the BLE pairing. Additionally, the attacker would need the ability to intercept Bluetooth communications.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed by disabling accessories with insecure Bluetooth connections.
*   Customers using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) version of the Titan Security Key by Google should review Android’s June Bulletins and Google’s advisory and take appropriate action.
