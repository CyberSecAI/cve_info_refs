Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in the `isPackageDeviceAdminOnAnyUser` method within the `PackageManagerService`. This method lacked a check for the `MANAGE_USERS` permission before granting access, allowing unauthorized access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing permission check:** The core issue is the absence of a permission check for `MANAGE_USERS` before allowing access to the `isPackageDeviceAdminOnAnyUser` method.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A local malicious application could exploit this to bypass user interaction requirements and gain access to permissions it shouldn't have.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** A malicious application can gain access to sensitive information and system resources due to improperly granted permissions.
- **Bypass user interaction:** Malicious app can potentially perform privileged actions without direct user consent or knowledge.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to install a malicious application on the device.
- **Bypass User Interaction:** The vulnerability enables the malicious app to bypass typical user interaction prompts for permission grants.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to install an application on the targeted device.
- The attacker needs to craft the malicious application to target the vulnerable method and exploit the missing permission check.

**Additional Information:**
- The provided commit message indicates the fix was implemented by adding a check for the `MANAGE_USERS` permission to the `isPackageDeviceAdminOnAnyUser` method in `PackageManagerService`.
- The commit also includes a test case (SafetyNet logging) to ensure the method remains usable by legitimate apps after the fix.
- The vulnerability affects Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
