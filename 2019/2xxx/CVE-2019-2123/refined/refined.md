Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2123:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a result of a double free condition in the Parcel object list when `setDataSize` is called. This means that memory allocated for objects within the parcel was being freed more than once.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Double Free:** The primary weakness is a double free vulnerability which occurs when the same memory region is deallocated twice, leading to memory corruption.
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** The vulnerability allows a local malicious application to elevate its privileges and execute arbitrary code within the context of a privileged process.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary code execution:** Successful exploitation allows a local malicious application to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.
- **System compromise:** This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Data exfiltration:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive data on the device.
- **Malicious activity:** The compromised process could be used to perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local malicious application:** The attacker needs to install a malicious application on the device. This application can then trigger the vulnerability through a crafted Parcel object.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local access:** The attacker needs to have a malicious app installed on the target device.
- **Ability to craft a malicious Parcel object:** The attacker needs to create a Parcel object with specific properties that will trigger the double free when the `setDataSize` is called.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located within the Android Framework.
- The fix involves changes in the `Parcel.cpp` file which can be found in the AOSP commits referenced in the provided text.
- The vulnerability affects a wide range of Android versions (7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9).
- The provided text also includes a test case `CtsOsTestCases:ParcelTest#testObjectDoubleFree` designed to verify the fix for this vulnerability.
