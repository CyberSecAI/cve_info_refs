  "CVE-2019-2721": {
    "Description": "Vulnerability in the Oracle VM VirtualBox component of Oracle Virtualization (subcomponent: Core). Supported versions that are affected are Prior to 5.2.28 and prior to 6.0.6. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle VM VirtualBox executes to compromise Oracle VM VirtualBox. While the vulnerability is in Oracle VM VirtualBox, attacks may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Oracle VM VirtualBox.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The hardened VirtualBox process on a Windows host doesnâ€™t secure its COM interface.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "The VirtualBox hardening code allows other processes running as the same user to read all virtual memory by granting the PROCESS_VM_READ access right.",
       "The process exposes an RPC interface through COM",
      "The undocumented IRundown interface's DoCallback method can execute an arbitrary function in the process with a single arbitrary pointer sized argument."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Arbitrary code injection and EoP. Allows an attacker to call arbitrary code inside the hardened process which can expose the kernel drivers to normal user processes resulting in EoP.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
        "Abusing the COM interface"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileged attacker with logon to the infrastructure where Oracle VM VirtualBox executes. The attacker needs to be able to read arbitrary memory from the VirtualBox process. Must be able to call existing interfaces running inside the VirtualBox process."
