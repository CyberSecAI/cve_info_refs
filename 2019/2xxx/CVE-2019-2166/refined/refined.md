Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-2166:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists within the libxaac library. This library was marked as experimental and has been removed from production Android builds starting with the November 2018 Android Security Bulletin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Multiple vulnerabilities exist within libxaac, including CVE-2019-2166. This implies memory corruption issues or similar, common in codec implementations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The document does not specify the exact impact of CVE-2019-2166 exploitation. However, other vulnerabilities within libxaac are classified as RCE (Remote Code Execution), EoP (Elevation of Privilege) and DoS (Denial of Service), thus it can be inferred that the impact could include at least one of those.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would likely involve processing a specially crafted audio file that triggers the vulnerability within the libxaac library. This would require the attacker to have a way to get a target device to decode such a file, usually through a media playback application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to get the targeted device to process a maliciously crafted audio file. This could involve social engineering to trick the user to open the file or exploiting another vulnerability to force the device to process it without user interaction.
