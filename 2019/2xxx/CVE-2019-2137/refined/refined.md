Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2137:

**CVE-2019-2137**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in `TelecommManager.endCall()`, specifically that it does not properly handle the scenario of ending an emergency call.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The primary weakness is a potential denial-of-service (DoS). The vulnerability lies in how the `endCall()` method in TelecommManager handles emergency calls. It does not prevent ending an emergency call which should not be allowed.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service by unexpectedly ending an ongoing emergency call. This would disrupt a crucial service and could have severe implications for the user during an emergency.

*   **Attack Vectors:** A local malicious application can use the `TelecommManager.endCall()` API to terminate a call.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device and have the necessary permissions to invoke the TelecommManager API.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided AOSP commit message clarifies that this is a documentation update, which highlights that ending an emergency call is not possible through the `endCall()` method. This change prevents the DoS.
