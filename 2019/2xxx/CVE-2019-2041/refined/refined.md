Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2041:

**Relates to CVE:** Yes

**Root Cause:** The provided text indicates a vulnerability related to data length checks in the HCI (Host Controller Interface) interface for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) implementations, specifically `BleAdvertiserVscHciInterfaceImpl` and `BleAdvertiserLegacyHciInterfaceImpl`. The maximum size of scan response and advertising packet data length should be `BTM_BLE_AD_DATA_LEN` (31).

**Vulnerability:** Insufficient data length validation in the BLE HCI interface.

**Impact:** Elevation of Privilege (EoP). Insufficient validation could lead to unexpected behavior or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted BLE advertising or scan response packets with lengths exceeding the expected maximum (`BTM_BLE_AD_DATA_LEN` = 31).

**Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be within Bluetooth range and capable of crafting and transmitting BLE packets.
