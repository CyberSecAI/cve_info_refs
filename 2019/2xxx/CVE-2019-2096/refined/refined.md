Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how the audio framework handles effect chains with the same session ID. Specifically, it's possible for tracks with the same session ID to run on various playback outputs, which leads to the creation of duplicate effect chains on the same session. This results in the same effect engine being released twice, due to the reuse of the same context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Resource Management:** The audio framework improperly manages effect chains, allowing the creation of multiple chains for the same session ID, and the double release of the same effect engine.
- **Potential for Use-After-Free (Implicit):** Although not directly stated, double-releasing an effect engine can lead to use-after-free or related memory corruption issues, which could be exploited for further malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege:** The CVE description indicates that this vulnerability is an Elevation of Privilege (EoP). Although not explicitly detailed in the provided content, the incorrect management of audio effects and potential use-after-free can be exploited by a malicious application to gain elevated privileges on the affected system.
- **Resource Exhaustion/Denial of Service (Potential):** The double creation and release of effect chains may potentially lead to resource exhaustion and a denial of service. This is not a primary impact described in the provided text, but is a possible consequence.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Malicious Application:** A malicious application, running locally on the affected device, could exploit this vulnerability. This implies that the attacker needs to install or have their app installed to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Manipulation of Audio Sessions:** By creating audio sessions with the same session ID across multiple outputs, a malicious application can trigger the described issues.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have the ability to install and run a malicious application on the target device.
- **Ability to create Audio Sessions:** The attacker needs to create and manipulate audio sessions with duplicate session IDs to trigger the flaw.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves ensuring that only one effect chain exists for a specific session ID and that the system prefers outputs with already existing effect chains.
- The provided content also includes commit messages that indicate the fix has been cherry-picked from prior commits.
- The content also mentions that previous fix was incomplete due to conflicts with pi-dev branch.
- Test cases mentioned are:  poc, CTS effect tests and No regression with Play Music and Effects.
