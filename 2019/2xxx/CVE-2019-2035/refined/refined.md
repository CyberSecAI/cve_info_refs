Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2035:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `rw_i93_sm_read_ndef()` function within the NFC (Near Field Communication) component of Android.
- It involves a potential out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read**: The function `rw_i93_sm_read_ndef()` might read beyond the allocated memory buffer, potentially accessing sensitive information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** A successful exploit could allow a local malicious application to gain elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** A malicious application, already installed on the device, could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device
- The attacker requires no user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, though the provided description indicates that user interaction is required to elevate permissions, this likely refers to a previous step of acquiring the access required to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the vulnerable `rw_i93_sm_read_ndef()` function, likely through interaction with the NFC hardware.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided commit messages indicate that the fix prevents an out-of-bounds error in the `rw_i93_sm_read_ndef()` and `rw_i93_sm_update_ndef()` functions. This suggests the vulnerability lies in improper bounds checking of the NDEF data being read or updated.
*   The vulnerability is present in Android versions 7.0, 7.1.1, 7.1.2, 8.0, 8.1, and 9.
*   The fix is available in AOSP via the provided commit link.

This analysis provides more detail than the initial CVE description, specifically about the vulnerable function and the type of out-of-bounds read involved.
