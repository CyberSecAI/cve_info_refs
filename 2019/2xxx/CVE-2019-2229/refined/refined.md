Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-2229:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The email update methods send a broadcast with the account name and folder information. This bypasses the `GET_ACCOUNT` permission if a third-party application listens to this broadcast.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Implicit permission bypass:** The broadcast sent by the update methods implicitly bypasses the `GET_ACCOUNT` permission.
- **Information disclosure:** The broadcast contains sensitive information such as the account name and folder information.
- **Missing authorization:** Third-party applications could listen to this broadcast without requiring `GET_ACCOUNT` permission.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker can obtain sensitive information such as account name and folder details without the proper permission.

**Attack vectors:**

- A malicious third-party application can register a broadcast receiver to listen to the specific broadcast emitted by the email update methods.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to install a malicious application on the user's device.
- The malicious app must be capable of listening to system broadcasts.

**Mitigation:**
- A new app permission `com.android.email.permission.GET_WIDGET_UPDATE` was introduced. This permission is now required to receive the emitted broadcast.
- The new permission is added to existing widgets.
