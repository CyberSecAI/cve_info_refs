{
  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2019-2114",
    "description": "NFC beaming of applications between devices using Android OS bypasses some security controls (the “install unknown application” prompt). A rogue device like a payment terminal can use this vulnerability to infect devices with malware.",
    "affected_versions": "Android version 8 (Oreo) and higher",
    "root_cause": "In Android 8 (Oreo), a new feature was introduced that requires users to opt-in to the “Install unknown apps” permission on a per-app basis. However, system applications signed by Google are automatically whitelisted and do not prompt the user for this permission. The NFC service, being a system application, has the permission to install other applications.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Bypassing user confirmation for installing unknown apps via NFC beaming",
       "Automatic whitelisting of system applications for install permissions"
    ],
    "impact": "Malware can be installed by bypassing the “install unknown apps” prompt, potentially leading to infection of devices.",
    "attack_vector": "NFC beaming of a malicious application from a rogue device (e.g., malicious phone or NFC payment terminal) to a vulnerable Android device.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs a device capable of NFC beaming and a malicious APK file. The attacker also needs to bring their device in close proximity to the victim's device."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "replication_steps": [
      "Setup two phones with NFC and Android beam enabled.",
      "Download any APK file on the “sender” phone.",
      "Go to the file manager in the “sender” phone, tap the file and select “Share”. Then select “Android Beam” as the sharing method.",
      "Bring two phones together and complete the transfer.",
      "After this is done, go to the receiver phone, tap the “Beam completed” notification, and tap the file. It will skip directly to the install prompt, bypassing the “Install unknown apps” check."
    ],
    "vendor_response": "The vendor (Google) classified this issue as High and assigned CVE-2019-2114 to track this issue. A fix was released in the October 2019 security bulletin. Users are encouraged to update their devices to mitigate this vulnerability. After applying the update, users are encouraged to check the “Install unknown apps” permission in settings to make sure the NFC Service is listed as “not allowed” to install applications.",
