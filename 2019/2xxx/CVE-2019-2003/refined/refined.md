  "CVE-2019-2003": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is related to how the system handles text with RLO/LRO (Right-to-Left Override/Left-to-Right Override) characters. The system was incorrectly linkifying such text and showing smart actions on selections, which could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially be exploited.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper handling of RLO/LRO characters during text processing, specifically in linkification and smart action display.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious application might be able to exploit the improper text handling to cause unexpected behavior. It could be an elevation of privilege vulnerability that allows a local malicious app to gain more access or control. It can cause the system to perform unexpected actions related to links and selections.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local malicious application can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating text content that includes RLO/LRO characters.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local application installed on the Android device needs to be crafted with the specific malicious text. The attacker needs to have the ability to execute the application on the targeted device."
