- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the `WebAssembly.Instance` method due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data. This leads to an out-of-bounds write past the end of a heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability is present in the `WebAssembly.Instance` method.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is remote, requiring user interaction in the form of visiting a malicious webpage or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to serve malicious content to the victim. The victim must then interact with this content (e.g., by visiting a malicious web page or opening a malicious file) for the vulnerability to be triggered.
