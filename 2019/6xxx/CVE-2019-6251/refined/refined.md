  "CVE-2019-6251": {
    "description": "WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit prior to version 2.24.1 are vulnerable to address bar spoofing upon certain JavaScript redirections. An attacker could cause malicious web content to be displayed as if for a trusted URI. This is similar to the CVE-2018-8383 issue in Microsoft Edge.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of URI changes during JavaScript redirections. WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit would update the displayed URI before the page load was fully committed, allowing a malicious page to change the URI in the address bar to a trusted URI, while actually loading malicious content.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "URI spoofing vulnerability due to improper handling of URI changes during JavaScript redirections."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could spoof the address bar to display a trusted URI while actually loading malicious content.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious website using JavaScript redirects to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to create a malicious website with Javascript code able to redirect the page to another URL while also delaying the page loading"
