Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2019-6120:

**Root Cause:**

*   The NiceHash Miner software allowed users to add their Bitcoin wallets using only their email address without any authorization check.
*   There was no rate limiting implemented when adding a wallet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Rate Limit:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of rate limiting on the functionality that adds a wallet using an email address. This allows an attacker to repeatedly attempt to add wallets using different email addresses.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** An attacker could iterate through numerous email addresses to determine if they are associated with a NiceHash account.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Upon finding a valid email address associated with a NiceHash account, the attacker could potentially view the miner's recent payment history, BTC wallet address, mining history, and workers information by using another vulnerability described as CVE-2019-6121.
*   **GDPR Violation:** This could lead to a GDPR violation due to the exposure of personal information without proper authorization.
*   **Potential for harm:** The exposed information could be used for illegal activities, including kidnapping for ransom of miners with high earnings as the article pointed out.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is the NiceHash Miner software's functionality that allows adding a wallet using an email address.
*   The attacker would exploit the lack of rate limiting by sending multiple requests to add wallets with different email addresses.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a working copy of the vulnerable NiceHash Miner software (version prior to 2.0.3.0).
*   The attacker needs to have a list of email addresses to attempt to add as wallets.
*   No specific network position is required, as the attack is against the NiceHash service/API.

**Additional details**

* The article provides details beyond the basic CVE description, including specific steps on how the vulnerability could be exploited and the potential impact on users.
* It also highlights the timeline of discovery, reporting, and resolution of the issue by NiceHash.
* The article also notes that while a fix was released by NiceHash, older versions of the software were still vulnerable as of January 2019.
