Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-6116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is that subroutines within pseudo-operators were not themselves required to be pseudo-operators in Ghostscript. This allowed attackers to craft malicious PostScript files where ephemeral or transient procedures could expose system operators, leading to potential code execution or denial of service. Specifically, these unprotected subroutines, when triggered by errors like `/stackoverflow` or `/typecheck`, could expose sensitive operators to error handlers.
*   The vulnerability stems from the way Ghostscript handles subroutines, especially those passed to control flow operators like `if` and `ifelse`. These subroutines, if not properly protected (i.e., not marked as `executeonly` and `odef`), could expose their contents or cause errors, enabling exploitation via error handlers.
*   A key issue was that name resolution of variables within subroutines was happening at execution time, not definition time. This allowed attackers to manipulate the dictstack to change the behavior of commands and operators, leading to exploitation.
*   Specifically, the vulnerability was due to the fact that some routines where not set to 'executeonly odef'.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper handling of subroutines within pseudo-operators:** Ghostscript failed to ensure that subroutines within pseudo-operators were themselves pseudo-operators, allowing access to system operators through improperly protected ephemeral routines.
*   **Missing protection of ephemeral routines:** Ghostscript did not adequately protect ephemeral routines used for conditions and loops, leaving them vulnerable to manipulation via errors.
*   **Bypass of `-dSAFER` sandbox:**  The vulnerability allowed attackers to bypass the `-dSAFER` sandbox, which is meant to restrict access to potentially dangerous PostScript operators.
*   **Exposure of sensitive operators:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive operators like `.forceput`, allowing arbitrary file access, code execution, and other malicious actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the process running Ghostscript, allowing them to potentially take over the system.
*   **Denial of service (DoS):** By causing specific errors, attackers could induce crashes or hangs in Ghostscript, rendering it unusable.
*   **Arbitrary file access:** Attackers could bypass security restrictions and access arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Modification of system files:** An attacker could modify files like `.bashrc` to execute arbitrary code upon user login.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malformed PostScript files:** Attackers crafted malicious PostScript files designed to trigger the vulnerability. These could be embedded in PDF files.
*   **File processing:** The malicious files could be processed using:
    *   The `gs` command directly.
    *   Applications using Ghostscript for rendering (e.g., Evince, ImageMagick, Nautilus, less, gimp, gv, etc.).
    *   Tools such as `less` by renaming the file to .pcd due to its usage of ImageMagick.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to craft a malicious PostScript file.**
*   **Ability to get a target user or system to process the malicious file** (e.g., via email attachments, web downloads, or by opening the file with a vulnerable application).
*   **No authentication or special privileges are needed**, the vulnerability could be exploited from remote with a crafted file.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The exploit manipulates the dictstack to change the behavior of commands at execution time.
*   Exploits could trigger specific errors like `/stackoverflow` or `/typecheck` to expose sensitive operators via error handling routines.
*   The `forceput` operator and  `DefineResource` method were exploited by manipulating subroutines inside pseudo-operators.
*   The issue arises from insufficient protection of ephemeral subroutines used for control structures like `if` and `ifelse` in PostScript.

This vulnerability was reported by Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero and is identified by CVE-2019-6116. Patches for this vulnerability required non-trivial fixes in Ghostscript code.
