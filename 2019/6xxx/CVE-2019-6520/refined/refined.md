Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6520:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is an **Improper Access Control** vulnerability. The device does not properly check authority on the server-side, allowing a read-only user to perform arbitrary configuration changes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The primary weakness is the lack of proper server-side authorization checks, allowing unauthorized users to modify device settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation allows a read-only user to perform arbitrary configuration changes. This can lead to disruption of network operations, modification of device behavior, and potential further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is **network-based (AV:N)**, meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
- The attack requires **low complexity (AC:L)**.
- No user interaction is needed (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) as the vulnerability allows a read-only user to perform arbitrary changes.
- The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device.
