Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before reflecting it back to the user's browser, leading to the execution of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's browser when they visit a compromised page. This can lead to:
    *   Stealing of cookies or session tokens
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection of users to malicious sites
    *   Other malicious activities within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is network-based (AV:N).
*   It requires user interaction (UI:R) such as clicking on a malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N) on the target system.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL or inject malicious script within a vulnerable parameter that the application reflects back to the user's browser.

**Affected Versions:**

*   a-blog cms prior to Ver.2.10.23 (Ver.2.10.x)
*   a-blog cms prior to Ver.2.9.26 (Ver.2.9.x)
*   a-blog cms prior to Ver.2.8.64 (Ver.2.8.x)
