{
  "CVE-2019-6543": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the fact that code is executed under the program runtime privileges.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to the compromise of the machine. An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable application.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exercised via the custom remote agent protocol, typically found on port 1234 or 51234. An attacker can send a specially crafted command to trigger the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system and the ability to send specially crafted commands through the remote agent protocol. No authentication is required."
  },
   "CVE-2019-6545": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper control of resource identifiers, allowing a remote user to execute an arbitrary process through a specially crafted database connection configuration file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Control of Resource Identifiers ('Resource Injection') (CWE-99)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote user to execute arbitrary processes on the server machine. This can result in complete compromise of the affected system.",
     "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted database connection file over the network via the remote agent protocol, usually on ports 1234 or 51234. This will cause the application to load the malicious file, resulting in arbitrary code execution.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system. The attacker needs to send a specially crafted command that causes the software to load the attacker-controlled database connection file from a network share using SMB. No authentication is required."
