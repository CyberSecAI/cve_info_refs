{
  "CVE-2019-6121": {
    "Root cause": "Missing authorization check when adding a wallet using an email address in NiceHash Miner.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure direct object reference",
      "Missing authorization"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker knowing a user's email address can view their NiceHash miner's recent payment history, BTC wallet address, mining history, and worker information. In addition, an attacker could potentially start mining using the victim's account, and use custom text for workers to potentially fool the victim.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs the victim's email address. This information can be obtained through OSINT techniques, such as social media profiles and publicly available resumes.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the victim's email address. Access to NiceHash Miner older versions (prior to 2.0.3.0) is also required."
