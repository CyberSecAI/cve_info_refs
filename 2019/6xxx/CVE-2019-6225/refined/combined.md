iOS/macOS: task_swap_mach_voucher() does not respect MIG semantics leading to use-after-free

The dangers of not obeying MIG semantics have been well documented: see issues 926 (CVE-2016-7612),
954 (CVE-2016-7633), 1417 (CVE-2017-13861, async_wake), 1520 (CVE-2018-4139), 1529 (CVE-2018-4206),
and 1629 (no CVE), as well as CVE-2018-4280 (blanket). However, despite numerous fixes and
mitigations, MIG issues persist and offer incredibly powerful exploit primitives. Part of the
problem is that MIG semantics are complicated and unintuitive and do not align well with the
kernel's abstractions.

Consider the MIG routine task_swap_mach_voucher():

	routine task_swap_mach_voucher(
			task		: task_t;
			new_voucher	: ipc_voucher_t;
		inout	old_voucher	: ipc_voucher_t);

Here's the (placeholder) implementation:

	kern_return_t
	task_swap_mach_voucher(
		task_t			task,
		ipc_voucher_t		new_voucher,
		ipc_voucher_t		*in_out_old_voucher)
	{
		if (TASK_NULL == task)
			return KERN_INVALID_TASK;

		*in_out_old_voucher = new_voucher;
		return KERN_SUCCESS;
	}

The correctness of this implementation depends on exactly how MIG ownership semantics are defined
for each of these parameters.

When dealing with Mach ports and out-of-line memory, ownership follows the traditional rules (the
ones violated by the bugs above):

1. All Mach ports (except the first) passed as input parameters are owned by the service routine if
   and only if the service routine returns success. If the service routine returns failure then MIG
   will deallocate the ports.

2. All out-of-line memory regions passed as input parameters are owned by the service routine if
   and only if the service routine returns success. If the service routine returns failure then MIG
   will deallocate all out-of-line memory.

But this is only part of the picture. There are more rules for other types of objects:

3. All objects with defined MIG translations that are passed as input-only parameters are borrowed
   by the service routine. For reference-counted objects, this means that the service routine is
   not given a reference, and hence a reference must be added if the service routine intends to
   keep the object around.

4. All objects with defined MIG translations that are returned in output parameters must be owned
   by the output parameter. For reference-counted objects, this means that output parameters
   consume a reference on the object.

And most unintuitive of all:

5. All objects with defined MIG translations that are passed as input in input-output parameters
   are owned (not borrowed!) by the service routine. This means that the service routine must
   consume the input object's reference.

Having defined MIG translations means that there is an automatic conversion defined between the
object type and its Mach port representation. A task port is one example of such a type: you can
convert a task port to the underlying task object using convert_port_to_task(), and you can convert
a task to its corresponding port using convert_task_to_port().

Getting back to Mach vouchers, this is the MIG definition of ipc_voucher_t:

	type ipc_voucher_t = mach_port_t
			intran: ipc_voucher_t convert_port_to_voucher(mach_port_t)
			outtran: mach_port_t convert_voucher_to_port(ipc_voucher_t)
			destructor: ipc_voucher_release(ipc_voucher_t)
		        ;

This definition means that MIG will automatically convert the voucher port input parameters to
ipc_voucher_t objects using convert_port_to_voucher(), convert the ipc_voucher_t output parameters
into ports using convert_voucher_to_port(), and discard any extra references using
ipc_voucher_release(). Note that convert_port_to_voucher() produces a voucher reference without
consuming a port reference, while convert_voucher_to_port() consumes a voucher reference and
produces a port reference.

To confirm our understanding of the MIG semantics outlined above, we can look at the function
_Xtask_swap_mach_voucher(), which is generated by MIG during the build process:

	mig_internal novalue _Xtask_swap_mach_voucher
		(mach_msg_header_t *InHeadP, mach_msg_header_t *OutHeadP)
	{
	...
		kern_return_t RetCode;
		task_t task;
		ipc_voucher_t new_voucher;
		ipc_voucher_t old_voucher;
	...
		task = convert_port_to_task(In0P->Head.msgh_request_port);

		new_voucher = convert_port_to_voucher(In0P->new_voucher.name);

		old_voucher = convert_port_to_voucher(In0P->old_voucher.name);

		RetCode = task_swap_mach_voucher(task, new_voucher, &old_voucher);

		ipc_voucher_release(new_voucher);

		task_deallocate(task);

		if (RetCode != KERN_SUCCESS) {
			MIG_RETURN_ERROR(OutP, RetCode);
		}
	...
		if (IP_VALID((ipc_port_t)In0P->old_voucher.name))
			ipc_port_release_send((ipc_port_t)In0P->old_voucher.name);

		if (IP_VALID((ipc_port_t)In0P->new_voucher.name))
			ipc_port_release_send((ipc_port_t)In0P->new_voucher.name);
	...
		OutP->old_voucher.name = (mach_port_t)convert_voucher_to_port(old_voucher);

		OutP->Head.msgh_bits |= MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX;
		OutP->Head.msgh_size = (mach_msg_size_t)(sizeof(Reply));
		OutP->msgh_body.msgh_descriptor_count = 1;
	}

Tracing where each of the references are going, we can deduce that:

1. The new_voucher parameter is deallocated with ipc_voucher_release() after invoking the service
   routine, so it is not owned by task_swap_mach_voucher(). In other words,
   task_swap_mach_voucher() is not given a reference on new_voucher.

2. The old_voucher parameter has a reference on it before it gets overwritten by
   task_swap_mach_voucher(), which means task_swap_mach_voucher() is being given a reference on the
   input value of old_voucher.

3. The value returned by task_swap_mach_voucher() in old_voucher is passed to
   convert_voucher_to_port(), which consumes a reference on the voucher. Thus,
   task_swap_mach_voucher() is giving _Xtask_swap_mach_voucher() a reference on the output value of
   old_voucher.

Finally, looking back at the implementation of task_swap_mach_voucher(), we can see that none of
these rules are being followed:

	kern_return_t
	task_swap_mach_voucher(
		task_t			task,
		ipc_voucher_t		new_voucher,
		ipc_voucher_t		*in_out_old_voucher)
	{
		if (TASK_NULL == task)
			return KERN_INVALID_TASK;

		*in_out_old_voucher = new_voucher;
		return KERN_SUCCESS;
	}

This results in two separate reference counting issues:

1. By overwriting the value of in_out_old_voucher without first releasing the reference, we are
   leaking a reference on the input value of old_voucher.

2. By assigning the value of new_voucher to in_out_old_voucher without adding a reference, we are
   consuming a reference we don't own, leading to an over-release of new_voucher.

Now, Apple has previously added a mitigation to make reference count leaks on Mach ports
non-exploitable by having the reference count saturate before it overflows. However, this
mitigation is not relevant here because we're leaking a reference on the actual ipc_voucher_t, not
on the voucher port that represents the voucher. And looking at the implementation of
ipc_voucher_reference() and ipc_voucher_release() (as of macOS 10.13.6), it's clear that the
voucher reference count is tracked independently of the port reference count:

	void
	ipc_voucher_reference(ipc_voucher_t voucher)
	{
		iv_refs_t refs;

		if (IPC_VOUCHER_NULL == voucher)
			return;

		refs = iv_reference(voucher);
		assert(1 < refs);
	}

	void
	ipc_voucher_release(ipc_voucher_t voucher)
	{
		if (IPC_VOUCHER_NULL != voucher)
			iv_release(voucher);
	}

	static inline iv_refs_t
	iv_reference(ipc_voucher_t iv)
	{
		iv_refs_t refs;

		refs = hw_atomic_add(&iv->iv_refs, 1);
		return refs;
	}

	static inline void
	iv_release(ipc_voucher_t iv)
	{
		iv_refs_t refs;

		assert(0 < iv->iv_refs);
		refs = hw_atomic_sub(&iv->iv_refs, 1);
		if (0 == refs)
			iv_dealloc(iv, TRUE);
	}

(The assert()s are not live on production builds.)

This vulnerability can be triggered without crossing any privilege/MACF checks, so it should be
reachable within every process and every sandbox.

On iOS 11 and macOS 10.13, both the over-reference and over-release vulnerabilities can be
independently exploited to free an ipc_voucher_t while it is still in use. On these platforms these
are incredibly powerful vulnerabilities, since they also let us receive a send right to a
freed-and-reallocated Mach port back in userspace. For some examples of why this is dangerous, see
Ian's thoughts in issue 941: <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=941#c3>.

As of iOS 12 and macOS 10.14, the voucher reference count is checked for underflow and overflow,
which does make the over-reference vulnerability non-exploitable. However, the over-release
vulnerability is still fully exploitable, and probably can still be used as a single,
direct-to-kernel bug from any process.

Additionally, while this report is of a single bug, it should indicate a wider problem with the
complexity of obeying MIG semantics. It might be worth reviewing other edge cases of MIG semantics
not covered by previous bugs.

(There's a variant of the over-reference vulnerability in thread_swap_mach_voucher(), but it is no
longer exploitable as of iOS 12.)

This proof-of-concept demonstrates the vulnerability by creating a Mach voucher, saving a reference
to it in the current thread's ith_voucher field via thread_set_mach_voucher(), decreasing the
reference count back to 1 using task_swap_mach_voucher(), and then freeing the voucher by
deallocating the voucher port in userspace. This leaves a dangling pointer to the freed voucher's
memory in ith_voucher, which can subsequently be accessed with a call to thread_get_mach_voucher(),
triggering a panic.

Tested on macOS 10.13.6 (17G4015), macOS 10.14.2, and iOS 12.1 (16B92).

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
