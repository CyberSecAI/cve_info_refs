{
  "CVE-2019-6443": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists due to an out-of-bounds read in the `ctl_getitem` function within `ntp_control.c`. The code iterates through a string in a received packet looking for delimiters, but the loop can increment `cp` beyond the end of the buffer, leading to a read of uninitialized data when `cp` is dereferenced to check for the '=' character.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The out-of-bounds read causes a crash due to a stack buffer overflow, as detected by AddressSanitizer.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a specially crafted NTP packet to a vulnerable NTPsec server triggers the out-of-bounds read within the `ctl_getitem` function during the processing of control messages.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to send UDP packets to the target NTPsec server. The specific payload can be sent without authentication, as the vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of control messages."
