# OSS-Fuzz

[Fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing) is a well-known technique for uncovering programming errors in software. Many of these detectable errors, like [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), can have serious security implications. Google has found [thousands](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=label%3AStability-LibFuzzer%2CStability-AFL%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1) of security vulnerabilities and stability bugs by deploying [guided in-process fuzzing of Chrome components](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/08/guided-in-process-fuzzing-of-chrome.html), and we now want to share that service with the open source community.

In cooperation with the [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) and the [OpenSSF](https://www.openssf.org/), OSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable, distributed execution. Projects that do not qualify for OSS-Fuzz (e.g. closed source) can run their own instances of [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz) or [ClusterFuzzLite](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/).

We support the [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html), [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus), [Honggfuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz), and [Centipede](https://github.com/google/centipede) fuzzing engines in combination with [Sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers), as well as [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz), a distributed fuzzer execution environment and reporting tool.

Currently, OSS-Fuzz supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python and Java/JVM code. Other languages supported by [LLVM](https://llvm.org) may work too. OSS-Fuzz supports fuzzing x86\_64 and i386 builds.

## Project history

OSS-Fuzz was launched in 2016 in response to the [Heartbleed](https://heartbleed.com/) vulnerability, discovered in [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), one of the most popular open source projects for encrypting web traffic. The vulnerability had the potential to affect almost every internet user, yet was caused by a relatively simple memory buffer overflow bug that could have been detected by fuzzing—that is, by running the code on randomized inputs to intentionally cause unexpected behaviors or crashes. At the time, though, fuzzing was not widely used and was cumbersome for developers, requiring extensive manual effort.

Google created OSS-Fuzz to fill this gap: it’s a free service that runs fuzzers for open source projects and privately alerts developers to the bugs detected. Since its launch, OSS-Fuzz has become a critical service for the open source community, growing beyond C/C++ to detect problems in memory-safe languages such as Go, Rust, and Python.

## Learn more about fuzzing

This documentation describes how to use OSS-Fuzz service for your open source project. To learn more about fuzzing in general, we recommend reading [libFuzzer tutorial](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md) and the other docs in [google/fuzzing](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/tree/master/docs) repository. These and some other resources are listed on the [useful links](/oss-fuzz/reference/useful-links/#tutorials) page.

## Trophies

As of August 2023, OSS-Fuzz has helped identify and fix over [10,000](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security%20label%3Aclusterfuzz%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1) vulnerabilities and [36,000](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug%20label%3Aclusterfuzz%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1) bugs across [1,000](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects) projects.

Package        : opensc
Version        : 0.19.0-1+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-6502 CVE-2021-42779 CVE-2021-42780 CVE-2021-42781
                 CVE-2021-42782 CVE-2023-2977
Debian Bug     : 1037021

Multiple vulnerabilities were found in opensc, a set of libraries and
utilities to access smart cards, which could lead to application crash
or information leak.

CVE-2019-6502

    Dhiraj Mishra discovered a minor memory leak in the eidenv(1) CLI
    utility on an error-case.

CVE-2021-42779

    A heap use after free vulnerability was discovered in
    sc_file_valid().

CVE-2021-42780

    An use after return vulnerability was discovered in insert_pin(),
    which could potentially crash programs using the library.

CVE-2021-42781

    Multiple heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in
    pkcs15-oberthur.c, which could potentially crash programs using the
    library.

CVE-2021-42782

    Multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in
    various places, which could potentially crash programs using the
    library.

CVE-2023-2977

    A buffer overrun vulnerability was discovered in pkcs15
    cardos_have_verifyrc_package(), which could lead to crash or
    information leak via smart card package with a malicious ASN1
    context.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
0.19.0-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your opensc packages.

For the detailed security status of opensc please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opensc>

Subject: OpenSC 0.20.0 released

Hi all!

I'm happy to finally announce the new release 0.20.0 of OpenSC. You can
read a full summary of the changes and get the release binaries on GitHub
<<https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.20.0>>.

We've extended our continuous testing by fuzzing the code with OSS-Fuzz
<<https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz>>. It is running billions of tests each
weak and has found around 100 unique crashes, most notable the security
issues tracked as CVE-2019-6502, CVE-2019-15946, CVE-2019-15945,
CVE-2019-19480, CVE-2019-19481 and CVE-2019-19479. Getting our hands on all
the problems reported by the fuzzing was very challenging. Special thanks
to Jakub Jelen, who spend many hours on analyzing and fixing many of the
issues.

Regards,
Frank Morgner.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
