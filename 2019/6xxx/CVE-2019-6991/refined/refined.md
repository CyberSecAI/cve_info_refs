The provided content relates to CVE-2019-6991.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `zmLoadUser()` function within the `zm_user.cpp` file of ZoneMinder. This occurs when processing user login credentials due to the use of the `mysql_real_escape_string()` function without proper bounds checking or input length restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `mysql_real_escape_string()` function is used to sanitize user-provided input (username and password) before using them in SQL queries. However, the destination buffers (`safer_username` and `safer_password`) are fixed-size arrays on the stack, while the input string length is not checked before passing it to the escaping function. If the input is longer than the buffer size, it leads to overwriting memory on the stack, causing a buffer overflow.
- **Lack of input validation:** There is no validation or limitation on the length of the username and password inputs received by the `zmu` binary before passing them to the escaping function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary impact of a stack-based buffer overflow is the potential for arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious input that overwrites the return address on the stack, an attacker can redirect program execution to injected shellcode or other malicious code.
- **Denial of Service:** Even without injecting code, overwriting stack data can lead to crashes due to unexpected program behavior or memory corruption, resulting in a denial of service.
- **Bypass Authentication:** An attacker could potentially overwrite function pointers or other critical data on the stack to bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability can be triggered by providing excessively long usernames and passwords to the `zmu` binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to provide command-line arguments to the `zmu` binary, specifically the username and password arguments using the `-U` and `-P` flags respectively.
- No prior privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability.
