Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6986:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a SPARQL query injection, caused by a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the VIVO application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to sanitize user-provided data before incorporating it into a SPARQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SPARQL code, which is then executed by the application's database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is that an attacker could use the injection to manipulate the data stored, potentially gain access to sensitive data, cause denial of service (as observed by VIVO hanging when the exploit is used), or perform other actions that could compromise the VIVO application and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the VIVO application's `/individual` endpoint, where the `uri` parameter is vulnerable to injection. The attacker sends a specially crafted URL including malicious SPARQL code as part of the `uri` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the VIVO application. They do not need prior authentication to exploit this vulnerability. The example `curl` command shows the exploitation is through a publicly accessible endpoint.
