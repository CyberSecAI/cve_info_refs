- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices store passwords in a recoverable format within the device configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Storing passwords in a recoverable format (CWE-257).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker who obtains a device configuration backup can extract and recover device passwords, compromising the confidentiality of those passwords.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires access to a device configuration backup. This could be obtained through various means, such as unauthorized network access or physical access to the device or its storage media.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to a device configuration backup. They do not need to authenticate to the device directly to perform the password recovery.
