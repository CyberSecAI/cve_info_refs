SSA-646841: Recoverable Password from Conﬁguration Storage in
SCALANCE X Switches

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.1

2019-06-11
2021-02-09
V1.2

SUMMARY

A vulnerability exists in several SCALANCE X switches that could allow external entities to reconstruct
passwords for users of the affected devices if an attacker is able to obtain a backup of the device
conﬁguration.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to conﬁg backups or archived device conﬁguration ﬁles

• Restrict or disable network access to mechanisms that allow to retrieve the device conﬁguration, if

enabled.

• Restrict access to device conﬁguration module C-PLUG, if in use.

• SCALANCE X-414-3E: Migrate to SCALANCE XM-400 product line

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens

recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6567

The affected devices store passwords in a recoverable format. An attacker may extract and recover
device passwords from the device conﬁguration.

Successful exploitation requires access to a device conﬁguration backup and impacts conﬁdentiality
of the stored passwords.
