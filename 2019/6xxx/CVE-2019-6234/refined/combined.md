| [Description](#c0)  Edward Muller    2002-02-12 22:02:47 UTC  ``` Here are new ebuilds for bonobo (v1.0.19), oaf (0.6.8) and ORBit(0.5.13).  The bonobo upgrade to v1.0.19 closes [bug #671](show_bug.cgi?id=671 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evolution mail based keyboard shortcuts stop working"). The others are along for the ride. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-13 13:28:00 UTC  ``` I don't see the attachements, but oh, well.  New ebuilds should be on rsync by now. ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Edward Muller    2002-02-13 17:10:32 UTC  ``` Since I can't upload the files via bugzilla I've posted them on my website. -- Bonobo 1.0.19  <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/bonobo-1.0.19.ebuild>  New upstream release, fixes [bug #671](show_bug.cgi?id=671 "RESOLVED FIXED - Evolution mail based keyboard shortcuts stop working") -- OAF 0.6.8  <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/oaf-0.6.8.ebuild>  New upstream release. -- ORBit 0.5.13  <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/ORBit-0.5.13.ebuild> <http://www.interlix.com/projects/gentoo/alloca.diff>  New upstream release. The alloca patch will probably be incorporated in future versions. It fixes a problem that becomes apparent when compiling the latest version of gnome-applets (updated ebuild to follow). --   ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Edward Muller    2002-02-13 17:11:14 UTC  ``` I couldn't upload the ebuilds. Someone on IRC verified the problem last night and was going to try to fix it. Looks like it's still broken though for me. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Grant Goodyear (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2002-02-14 10:40:56 UTC  ``` Added.  Thanks! ``` |  |
