The content is related to CVE-2019-6802.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `pypiserver` application doesn't properly escape newline characters in URIs when redirecting users.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CRLF injection vulnerability. The lack of proper escaping of newline characters (`\r`, `%0d` and `\n`, `%0a`) in the URI allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers into the response.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Ability to create arbitrary HTTP responses.
    - Setting of malicious cookies.
    - Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the `location` header does not redirect to a valid host and displays arbitrary content.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a URL containing encoded newline characters (`%0d%0a`) followed by malicious HTTP headers (e.g., `Set-Cookie: malicious=1`).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable `pypiserver` instance.
