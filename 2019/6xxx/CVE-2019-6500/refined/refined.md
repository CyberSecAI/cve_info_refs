- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation when processing HTTP GET requests, which allows an attacker to use URL-encoded directory traversal sequences (`%2e%2e`) to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal (or path traversal) vulnerability (CWE-259). The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing attackers to access arbitrary files on the server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, system files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), application source code, and any other file accessible to the web server. This can lead to information disclosure and potentially further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP GET request, which includes URL-encoded directory traversal sequences (`%2e%2e`) in the requested path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. They only need the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
