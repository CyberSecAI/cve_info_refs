Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6000:

**1. Verification:**
The content directly relates to CVE-2019-6000, as it is specifically mentioned in the security advisory for Canon digital cameras regarding PTP communication functions and firmware update functions. The vulnerability is described as a buffer overflow in the PTP (Picture Transfer Protocol) when processing the `sendhostinfo` command.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `SendHostInfo` PTP command handler of Canon digital cameras. Specifically, the code attempts to check the size of the incoming message, but it does not prevent the overflow as it continues to process the oversized packet even after logging the error.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** A classic buffer overflow vulnerability occurs when the `memcpy` operation copies more data than the allocated buffer size. The vulnerability resides in the PTP handler for the command `SendHostInfo` (opcode `0x91E4`). The vulnerability exists because the code does not properly handle messages larger than the expected size, even after logging that an error occurred.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this buffer overflow could allow a remote attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the camera. The attacker can inject and execute their own malicious code, and gain full control of the device.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can also be exploited to cause a denial of service by crashing the camera.
    *  **Malware Installation:** As demonstrated, it is possible to use the vulnerability to load and execute malware such as ransomware.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **PTP/IP (WiFi):** An attacker in close proximity can exploit the vulnerability over WiFi by sending a malformed `SendHostInfo` command. The attacker can set up a rogue WiFi access point to intercept connections from vulnerable cameras.
    *   **PTP/USB:** An attacker with control over a connected PC can exploit the vulnerability through the USB connection, by sending the malformed PTP command.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Proximity (WiFi):** For WiFi attacks, the attacker needs to be within the range of the camera's WiFi signal.
    *   **Access to a compromised PC (USB):** For USB attacks, the attacker needs to have already compromised a PC that the camera is connected to, using for example malware.
    *   **Knowledge of PTP:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the Picture Transfer Protocol and the specific commands to exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `research.checkpoint.com` content provides in-depth technical details, exploit analysis, and proof-of-concept scenarios, including a ransomware attack leveraging this and other vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-5994, CVE-2019-5998, CVE-2019-5999 and CVE-2019-6001). This research highlights the potential impact of the vulnerability including hijacking of the camera, data exfiltration, malware installation or ransomware attacks.
*  The `jvn.jp` content provides a summary of the vulnerability and a basic CVSS score.
* The advisory from canon-europe.com and usa.canon.com provides basic mitigations that can be applied by the user as well as firmware update information.
* The "SendHostInfo" vulnerability is used in the exploit chain of the check point researchers after failing to exploit the "NotifyBtStatus" vulnerability, due to crashes occurring when using the WiFi interface. This provides additional insight into the exploitability of each vulnerability.
