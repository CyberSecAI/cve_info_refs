- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Infinite recursion in the functions `expr6`, `expr5`, `expr4`, `expr3`, `expr2`, `expr1`, and `expr0` within the `eval.c` file. This recursion is triggered by specific scenarios involving a large number of '{' characters in the input assembly code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack exhaustion due to unbounded recursion. The vulnerability is present in the expression evaluation logic within the assembler.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A crafted assembly file can cause a stack overflow, leading to a crash of the assembler. This can cause a denial of service, preventing the assembler from functioning.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious user can craft a specific assembly file containing nested '{' characters, which triggers the infinite recursion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted assembly file to the NASM assembler.
