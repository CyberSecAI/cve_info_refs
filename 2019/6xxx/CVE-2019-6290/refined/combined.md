There is a stack exhaustion problem resulting from infinite recursion in the functions expr6, expr5, expr4, expr3, expr2, expr1, expr0 in eval.c, in certain scenarios involving lots of '{' characters.  Here is the POC file. Please use the “./nasm -f bin $POC -o /dev/null” to reproduce the bug. Command：“./nasm -f bin $POC -o /dev/null ”   $git log  > commit 81f98fe79be23174e2d6ddd9f17a5cfb9ca71ec7 > Author: H.

You can make the number of recursions go up by 11,000 or so by dynamically allocating variables instead of using stack space, but at the end of the day, you can work around this (for this test case) by doing:  > ulimit -s 8192  Of course, a much larger (deeper) ASM file will still make it crash. You can thus, make it happen far faster by doing:  > ulimit -s 256  The crash does not seem to happen due to any buffer overflows or memory corruption; it's simply the kernel saying "you're out of stack space, please die". One simple way to avoid the crash itself is to do a depth-check of the tree and compare it to some value related to the stack size returned and produce an error if the values are way out of whack.  A more complicated solution would involve removing recursion, which looks like it would not be a trivial fix. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3392548#c3)  Cheng Wen    2019-01-02 23:23:15 PST  ``` To fix such errors, there are some classic study cases.  Similar cases occur in binutils v2.31, too. Too fix this problem, for example, binutils v2.32 add a recursion limit to libiberty's demangling code. The limit is enabled by default, but can be disabled via a new demangling option.  See <https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=87336> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3392548#c4)  Randy MacLeod    2019-07-17 09:27:04 PDT  ``` Cheng,  Thanks for presenting your analysis of the defect. It is trivially handled by the user as you say but a default recursion limit would be nice. Do you plan to implement that feature to fight off the CVE hounds? Thanks, Randy ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3392548#c5)  Polampalli, Archana    2023-04-24 00:24:27 PDT  ``` Hi Cheng,  Could you please confirm is this fixed on nasm-v2.16.01   Thanks in advance ``` |  |
