# Exploit Title: MyBB IP History Logs Plugin 1.0.2 - Cross-Site Scripting
# Date: 1/25/2018
# Author: 0xB9
# Twitter: @0xB9Sec
# Contact: 0xB9[at]pm.me
# Software Link: https://community.mybb.com/mods.php?action=view&pid=1213
# Version: 1.0.2
# Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04
# CVE: CVE-2019-6979

1. Description:
This plugin keeps a record of a users IP & User-Agent history. The User-Agent isn't sanitized to user input allowing for an XSS via ACP.

2. Proof of Concept:

- Change your User-Agent to a payload   <script>alert('XSS')</script>
- Log into an account

When admin visits the IP/User-Agent history page the payload will execute
http://localhost/[path]/admin/index.php?module=tools-ip_history_logs

3. Solution:
Update to 1.0.3

```

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

### Project Details

This is my first MyBB plugin so excuse if any mistakes are made. I created this plugin as I wanted to keep a record of every users IP when it changes. I know MyBB keeps a record but it only records the IP when a post is made or a PM or the last IP they used on the website. For my website this was not sufficient as a lot of my users would use a VPN/Proxy to evade and I would want to blacklist all their IP's which they use and most of the time they weren't making a post so I didn't have a sufficient log of IP history to go off.

This keeps a record of a users IP history as they use the website. This is useful for auditing fraud/ban evaders/general/when people start using VPNS/Proxys/Different Devices during their user activity. It can record every instance when a User's IP/User Agent is changed and how often, the page they were viewing and their useragent. The logging page is powered by DataTables which allows you to filter & sort by a user id, pagetitle, user agent or an IP address. It also has CloudFlare support to ensure the correct User IP is shown and more features(Tasks ect).

NEW![Toungue](https://community.mybb.com/images/smilies/tongue.gif "Toungue")

\* Important \*

Any Users who are on version 1.0.3 MUST uninstall the plugin before installing the new one. As a result you will lose current data. However the new version is far superior and recommended

New database structure brings it inline with MyBB standard which also allows more people using an older database to use this plugin.

New filtering options allow you to limit how many results are returned which will be immensely useful in larger forums and also includes user filtering and sorting options which I expect will be very helpful.

You can of course still filter using the DataTable by clicking on the columns and searching in there as well. This update is quite big in comparison to code changed but I hope you all enjoy it.

I'm happy to take suggestions/bugs on my GitHub: <https://github.com/JeremyCrookshank/IP_History_Logs>
