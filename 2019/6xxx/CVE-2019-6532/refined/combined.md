## Panasonic Control FPWIN PRO Project File Parsing sc\_obj Type Confusion Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-19-570ZDI-CAN-7850

| CVE ID | [CVE-2019-6532](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-6532) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Panasonic](https://na.panasonic.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Control FPWIN Pro |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Panasonic Control FPWin Pro. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of PRO files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a type confusion condition. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |

ICS Advisory
# Panasonic Control FPWIN Pro

Last RevisedJune 10, 2019
Alert CodeICSA-19-157-02

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 7.3**
* **ATTENTION:** Low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Panasonic
* **Equipment:** Control FPWIN Pro
* **Vulnerabilities:** Heap-based Buffer Overflow, Type Confusion

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device and allow remote code execution.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Control FPWIN Pro, a PLC programming software, are affected:

* FPWIN Pro Version 7.3.0.0 and prior

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

**3.2.1    [HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)**

Attacker-created project files loaded by an authenticated user can cause heap-based buffer overflows, which may lead to remote code execution.

[CVE-2019-6530](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6530) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**3.2.2    [ACCESS OF RESOURCE USING INCOMPATIBLE TYPE ('TYPE CONFUSION') CWE-843](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/843.html)**

Attacker-created project files loaded by an authenticated user can trigger incompatible type errors because the resource does not have expected properties. This may lead to remote code execution.

[CVE-2019-6532](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6532) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Commercial Facilities, Critical Manufacturing, and Food and Agriculture
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Japan

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

9sg Security Team working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Panasonic recommends users upgrade to FPWIN Pro Version 7.3.1.0 or newer, which can be downloaded at the following link:

<https://www.panasonic-electric-works.com/eu/plc-software-control-fpwin-pro.htm>

For more information about these issues or other vulnerabilities in Panasonic products, please contact the Panasonic Product Security Incident Response Team:

NCCIC recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
