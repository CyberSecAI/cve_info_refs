  "CVE-2019-6769": {
    "Description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the removeField method when processing AcroForms. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability exists because the `removeField` method doesn't validate if an object exists before attempting an operation on it.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Lack of validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution within the context of the current process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page",
      "Opening a malicious file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious PDF file with a crafted AcroForm using the `removeField` method",
    "Affected product": "Foxit Reader"
  }
