### [Disappointing Experience and Lack of Support](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/disappointing-experience-and-lack-of-support/)

[Incitatus](https://profiles.wordpress.org/incitatus/ "Posts by Incitatus")
December 10, 2024

I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Graph Paper Press. After using their services for some time, I was charged $299.00 for a software license renewal. However, my user account was deleted by the company around 5 months into a 12 month contract. Therefore I could not manage or cancel any future payments.
When I contacted their support team to rectify the account issue, I received no response whatsoever. This lack of communication and accountability is highly unprofessional and left me with no choice but to involve my bank to dispute the charge.
While the product itself was decent during my use, the poor customer support and questionable practices around account management and billing have completely overshadowed any positive impressions I had.
I strongly urge others to reconsider before purchasing from this company or subscribing to their services. If something goes wrong, don’t expect timely or helpful support.

### [Complicated](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/complicated-20/)

Downloaded to evaluate the free version as it would work for selling thousands of images. It does not. You have to create one product by any images or it is so bad explained that I could not find a way to bulk edit in seconds and put the images in a collection for sell. If a software is unintuitive from the start, it is a ticket for headaches down the road. Not recommended

To many bugs to be able to use it. Uploads, Pricing, etc.

### [Plugin ok, very good but slow assistance](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-ok-very-bad-assistance/)

assistance puts us too much to give support, but when they answer you they are very good and precise in giving answers with logic and commitment!
