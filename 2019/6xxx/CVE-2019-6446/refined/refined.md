      "status": "relevant",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the unsafe usage of the `pickle` Python module in NumPy's `numpy.load` function. Specifically, it allows loading of pickled object arrays from untrusted sources by default.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Unsafe deserialization using pickle module.",

          "Network-based attacks involving a crafted serialized object.",
          "Local attacks where the attacker controls the input to `numpy.load`"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to create or control a crafted serialized object which is loaded using numpy load. In some cases this can be achieved by network based attacks if there is an application using numpy load on untrusted data, and in other cases local access is needed."
