Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6485:

**Vulnerability Details**
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how Citrix implementations handle TLS CBC padding and MAC verification. Specifically, the server checks the last padding byte, then the MAC. If the MAC is invalid, the server closes the connection. However, the closing behavior (connection timeout or RST) depends on the validity of the remaining padding bytes which leaks information about the padding validity. If the MAC is valid the server checks the remaining padding bytes.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Padding Oracle:** The server exhibits different behaviors based on the validity of the padding in the TLS record. This allows an attacker to infer information about the plaintext by observing these server responses. The server response differs based on if there is an invalid mac or padding.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can decrypt TLS traffic by exploiting the padding oracle. This could potentially lead to the exposure of sensitive information transmitted over the connection, such as session cookies.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify TLS traffic. This typically involves being an active Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).
    *   **Browser-based attacks:** The attacker would need to be able to run a script in the victim's browser. This can be done by enticing the victim to visit a malicious website.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be able to inject malicious javascript into the victim's browser
    *   The attacker must be in a position to intercept and modify the victim's TLS traffic (Man-in-the-Middle).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text gives more detail regarding the root cause and exploitation than the CVE description.
*   The vulnerability is similar to the POODLE attack but not limited to SSLv3

**Summary:**
The vulnerability lies in Citrix's TLS implementation which exhibits different behaviors based on the validity of the padding bytes within the encrypted data stream. An attacker can leverage these different behaviors to decrypt the encrypted data.
