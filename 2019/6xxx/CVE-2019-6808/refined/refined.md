Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-6808

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper access control in the UMAS strategy programming functionality of the Schneider Electric Unity Pro L Programming Software PLC Simulator. Specifically, the simulator allows unauthenticated commands to be sent to program a new device strategy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The PLC simulator lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing any attacker to send UMAS commands without prior validation.
*   **Unrestricted Strategy Programming:** The simulator allows an attacker to upload a modified strategy. This includes replacing the original logic with malicious shellcode.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The simulator doesn't properly validate or sanitize the uploaded strategy.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By sending a crafted sequence of UMAS commands, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the host system running the PLC simulator. This is achieved by replacing the original PLC strategy with malicious shellcode.
*   **Complete Compromise:** The attacker gains full control over the system where the PLC simulator is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The PLC simulator opens a port (0.0.0.0:502) and listens for incoming UMAS commands.
*   **Unauthenticated Commands:** The attacker can send unauthenticated UMAS commands over the network to the PLC simulator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to reach the machine running the vulnerable PLC simulator on port 502.
*   **Knowledge of UMAS Protocol:** The attacker needs to know the structure and sequence of the required UMAS commands.

**Technical Details:**

The exploit involves sending the following UMAS commands in the specified order:

1.  **TAKE\_PLC\_RESERVATION:** Obtains a session and privileges to send other commands.
2.  **INITIALIZE\_UPLOAD:** Signals that a new program upload will follow.
3.  **UPLOAD\_BLOCK:** Sends the first block of data.
4.  **Command 0x6D:** An intermediate command needed to proceed.
5.  **UPLOAD\_BLOCK:** Sends blocks of the new strategy, resending the first block.
6.  **END\_STRATEGY\_UPLOAD:** Indicates the end of the strategy upload.
7.  **RELEASE\_PLC\_RESERVATION:** Releases the device reservation.

By manipulating the data within these UMAS commands, an attacker can replace the original PLC strategy with a malicious version that allows arbitrary code execution.
