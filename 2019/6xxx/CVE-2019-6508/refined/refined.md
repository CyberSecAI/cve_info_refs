The content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability present in the `/srcpm/app/admin/views.py` file of the `creditease-sec/insight` repository.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection on several delete endpoints in the admin panel. Specifically, the `/login_user_delete/<id>`, `/role_perm_delete/<role_name>`, `/depart_delete/<id>`, and `/user_delete/<id>` endpoints are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The identified endpoints perform state-changing operations (deleting users, roles, departments, etc.) without verifying the origin of the request. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into inadvertently performing these actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can perform the following actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator:

*   Delete login users.
*   Delete roles and their associated permissions.
*   Delete departments.
*   Delete users.

**Attack vectors:**
*   An attacker can embed a malicious image tag or similar HTML element on a webpage or in a comment/post where a logged-in admin is likely to visit. This image tag's `src` attribute will point to a vulnerable endpoint with the ID of the target entity to be deleted.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to post content where an administrator is likely to visit, or trick the administrator into visiting a webpage controlled by the attacker.
*   The attacker does not need to know the exact ID of resources beforehand since they can iterate through the resources by incrementing the ID.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to execute the CSRF attack. They rely on an existing authenticated administrator's session for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how an attacker can use an `<img>` tag to trigger the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The code snippets show the vulnerable endpoints and the database operations performed during deletion.
