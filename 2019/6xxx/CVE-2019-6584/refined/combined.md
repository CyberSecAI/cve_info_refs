SSA-774850: Vulnerabilities in SIEMENS LOGO!8 devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2019-06-11
2020-02-10
V1.1

SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in SIEMENS LOGO!8 devices. The Session ID on the integrated
webserver of LOGO!8 devices is not invalidated upon logout. The second vulnerability could allow
an attacker with network access to port 10005/tcp to cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending
speciﬁcally crafted packages to the service.

Siemens provides a ﬁrmware update for the latest version of LOGO!8 devices. For older versions, the
device needs to be upgraded (see table below).

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Protect network access to the device.

• As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to the
devices with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to our
operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6571

An attacker with network access to port 10005/tcp of the LOGO! device could cause a Denial-of-Service
condition by sending specially crafted packets.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to
the affected service. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful
exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises availability of the targeted system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

of a Memory Buffer

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6584

The integrated webserver does not invalidate the Session ID upon user logout. An attacker that
successfully extracted a valid Session ID is able to use it even after the user logs out.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker in a privileged network position who is able
to read the communication between the affected device and the user or by an attacker who is able to
obtain valid Session IDs through other means. The user must invoke a session to the affected device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
