**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The products contain a flaw that allows a local user to gain unauthorized privileges. The specific technical details of the vulnerability are not provided.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A user with local access to a machine with a vulnerable product installed can escalate their privileges and execute arbitrary code. This could lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
