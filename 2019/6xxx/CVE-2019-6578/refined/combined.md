## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends that affected users upgrade to NXGpro control. Please contact Siemens’ customer service to obtain and install the upgrade.

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Install a protocol bridge that isolates the networks and eliminates direct connections to the Ethernet Modbus Interface.
* Apply cell protection concept and implement defense in depth.

For more information see Siemens advisory SSA-606525 located at:

<https://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS Perfect Harmony GH180 medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety
of medium voltage converters or inverters in different applications.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6578

A denial of service vulnerability exists in the affected products.

The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the device. Successful
exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to
compromise availability of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
