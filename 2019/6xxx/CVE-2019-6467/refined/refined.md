Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6467:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A programming error exists within the `nxdomain-redirect` feature of BIND. Specifically, the issue arises when the alternate namespace used for redirection is a descendant of a zone served locally.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Assertion failure in `query.c`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability can cause an assertion failure, leading to the BIND server exiting, which effectively results in a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specifically crafted DNS query that interacts with the nxdomain-redirect feature when the alternate namespace is a descendant of a local zone.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to send malicious DNS queries. No special privileges or user interaction are required.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the BIND server is configured to perform NXDOMAIN redirection for recursive clients while also serving a local copy of the root zone, or using mirroring to provide the root zone. However, other configurations can also lead to the issue.
- The vulnerability affects BIND versions 9.12.0 to 9.12.4, 9.14.0, and all releases in the 9.13 development branch.
- Synology's DNS Server is not affected by this vulnerability as it uses versions prior to the affected ones.
