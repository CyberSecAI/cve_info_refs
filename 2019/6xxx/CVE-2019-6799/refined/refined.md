Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
    *   A bug in PHP that prevents phpMyAdmin's attempt to block `LOAD DATA INFILE`.
    *   The default enabling of `mysql.allow_local_infile` in the 'mysql' PHP extension.
    *   The `AllowArbitraryServer` phpMyAdmin configuration setting.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that the web server's user has access to.
*   **Bypass of Security Checks:** phpMyAdmin's attempt to block `LOAD DATA INFILE` is ineffective due to the PHP bug.
*   **Default Configuration Issues:** The default setting of `mysql.allow_local_infile` in PHP allows for the exploit.
*  **`AllowArbitraryServer` Configuration:** When this setting is enabled, it exacerbates the issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, credentials, or other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Rogue MySQL Server:** An attacker can use a malicious MySQL server to trick phpMyAdmin into executing `LOAD DATA INFILE` with a path to a file on the web server, when `AllowArbitraryServer` is set to true.
*   **Local MySQL Account:** If `AllowArbitraryServer` is false (default), the attacker needs a local MySQL account on the server to exploit the vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the phpMyAdmin instance.
*   **MySQL Server:** An attacker needs a rogue MySQL server (if `AllowArbitraryServer` is enabled).
*   **Local MySQL Account:** If `AllowArbitraryServer` is disabled, the attacker needs a valid local MySQL account.
*   **Web server user permissions:** The attacker will only be able to read files that the webserver user can access

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects phpMyAdmin versions from at least 4.0 through 4.8.4.
*   The vulnerability is considered critical.
*   The issue is fixed in phpMyAdmin 4.8.5 and newer versions.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CWE-661 (Incorrect Creation of SQL Queries).
*   The Debian security advisory (DLA 1692-1) confirms the vulnerability and provides a fix for Debian 8 "Jessie".
