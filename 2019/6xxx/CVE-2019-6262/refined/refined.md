- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate checks on the Global Configuration helpurl settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the help URL field within the global configuration. This code will be stored and executed when a user views the help URL, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious code into the help URL field via the Global Configuration settings.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs administrative access to the Joomla! CMS to modify the Global Configuration settings.
