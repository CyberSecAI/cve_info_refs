The provided content is related to CVE-2019-6137.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `LinkLayer_setAddress` function located in `link_layer.c`. The `self` pointer, which should point to a `LinkLayer` structure, is NULL when the function is called.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference vulnerability: The code attempts to access the `address` member of the `LinkLayer` structure through a NULL `self` pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The program crashes due to a segmentation fault (SEGV). This could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerable code can be reached during normal program execution when setting the address of a link layer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `LinkLayer_setAddress` function with a NULL `self` pointer. The stack trace shows that this call is reachable through the `CS101_Master_setOwnAddress` function and the `main` function in the example application.
