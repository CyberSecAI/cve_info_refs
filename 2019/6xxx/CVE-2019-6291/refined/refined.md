- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `expr6` function in `eval.c` makes recursive calls to itself without a proper depth check, leading to stack exhaustion when processing assembly code with many `!` characters or sequences of `-` and `+` symbols.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stack exhaustion due to uncontrolled recursion in the expression evaluation logic.
    - Lack of depth check or mechanism to prevent excessively deep recursion.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS). The assembler crashes due to stack overflow, preventing it from assembling the input file.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - A specially crafted assembly file containing many `!` characters or sequences of `-` and `+` symbols in expressions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Ability to provide an input assembly file to the NASM assembler.
