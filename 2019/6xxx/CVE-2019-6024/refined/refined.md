**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Rakuma App for both Android and iOS had a vulnerability that allowed for the disclosure of authentication information. The specific root cause is not detailed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is an authentication information disclosure vulnerability (CWE-200). The app was not adequately protecting user authentication data. The vulnerability is related to permissions (CWE-264).

**Impact of exploitation:**
If a malicious application, designed to attack a Rakuma user, is installed on the user's mobile device, it can potentially obtain the user's authentication information. This would allow an attacker to potentially impersonate the user, or access user data.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local, requiring a malicious application to be present on the same device as the vulnerable Rakuma app.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to create a malicious application and convince a user to install it on their device. Once installed, the malicious app can exploit the vulnerability in the Rakuma app to steal authentication information. User interaction is required to install the malicious app.
