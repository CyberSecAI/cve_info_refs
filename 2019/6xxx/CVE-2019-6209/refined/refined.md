   "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs in the `if_ports_used_update_wakeuuid` function in the kernel. The function reads a user-controlled SleepWakeUUID property, parses it into a binary UUID using uuid_parse(), and then copies it to a global sysctl variable `current_wakeuuid`. If the SleepWakeUUID string's first character is not a valid hexadecimal digit, uuid_parse() will fail, and the uninitialized `wakeuuid` buffer on the stack will be copied to the global `current_wakeuuid` variable, which can then be read from userspace."
