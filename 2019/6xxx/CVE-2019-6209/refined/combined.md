**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
macOS 10.13.4 introduced the file bsd/net/if_ports_used.c, which defines sysctls for inspecting
ports, and added the function IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey() to the file
iokit/Kernel/IOPMrootDomain.cpp. Here's the code of the latter function:

	extern "C" bool
	IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey(char *buffer, size_t buf_len)
	{
		if (!gSleepWakeUUIDIsSet) {
			return (false);
		}

		if (buffer != NULL) {
			OSString *string;

			string = (OSString *)
			    gRootDomain->copyProperty(kIOPMSleepWakeUUIDKey);

			if (string == NULL) {
				*buffer = '\0';
			} else {
				strlcpy(buffer, string->getCStringNoCopy(), buf_len);

				string->release();
			}
		}

		return (true);
	}

This function is interesting because it copies a caller-specified amount of data from the
"SleepWakeUUID" property (which is user-controllable). Thus, if a user process sets "SleepWakeUUID"
to a shorter string than the caller expects and then triggers IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey(),
out-of-bounds heap data will be copied into the caller's buffer.

However, triggering this particular information leak is challenging, since the only caller is the
function if_ports_used_update_wakeuuid(). Nonetheless, this function also contains an information
leak:

	void
	if_ports_used_update_wakeuuid(struct ifnet *ifp)
	{
		uuid_t wakeuuid;							// (a) wakeuuid is uninitialized.
		bool wakeuuid_is_set = false;
		bool updated = false;

		if (__improbable(use_test_wakeuuid)) {
			wakeuuid_is_set = get_test_wake_uuid(wakeuuid);
		} else {
			uuid_string_t wakeuuid_str;

			wakeuuid_is_set = IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey(wakeuuid_str,	// (b) wakeuuid_str is controllable.
			    sizeof(wakeuuid_str));
			if (wakeuuid_is_set) {
				uuid_parse(wakeuuid_str, wakeuuid);			// (c) The return value of
			}								//     uuid_parse() is not checked.
		}

		if (!wakeuuid_is_set) {
			if (if_ports_used_verbose > 0) {
				os_log_info(OS_LOG_DEFAULT,
				    "%s: SleepWakeUUID not set, "
				    "don't update the port list for %s\n",
				    __func__, ifp != NULL ? if_name(ifp) : "");
			}
			wakeuuid_not_set_count += 1;
			if (ifp != NULL) {
				microtime(&wakeuuid_not_set_last_time);
				strlcpy(wakeuuid_not_set_last_if, if_name(ifp),
				    sizeof(wakeuuid_not_set_last_if));
			}
			return;
		}

		lck_mtx_lock(&net_port_entry_head_lock);
		if (uuid_compare(wakeuuid, current_wakeuuid) != 0) {			// (e) These UUIDs will be different.
			net_port_entry_list_clear();
			uuid_copy(current_wakeuuid, wakeuuid);				// (f) Uninitialized stack garbage
			updated = true;							//     will be copied into a sysctl
		}									//     variable.
		/*
		 * Record the time last checked

		microuptime(&wakeuiid_last_check);
		lck_mtx_unlock(&net_port_entry_head_lock);

		if (updated && if_ports_used_verbose > 0) {
			uuid_string_t uuid_str;

			uuid_unparse(current_wakeuuid, uuid_str);
			log(LOG_ERR, "%s: current wakeuuid %s\n",
			    __func__,
			    uuid_str);
		}
	}

After the user-controllable "SleepWakeUUID" property is copied into the wakeuuid_str buffer using
IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey(), the UUID string is converted into a (binary) UUID using the function
uuid_parse(). uuid_parse() is meant to parse the string-encoded UUID into the local wakeuuid
buffer. However, the wakeuuid buffer is not initialized and the return value of uuid_parse() is not
checked, meaning that if we set the "SleepWakeUUID" property's first character to anything other
than a valid hexadecimal digit, we can get random stack garbage copied into the global
current_wakeuuid buffer. This is problematic because current_wakeuuid is a sysctl variable, meaning
its value can be read from userspace.

Tested on macOS 10.13.6 17G2112:

	bazad@bazad-macbookpro ~/Developer/poc/wakeuuid-leak % clang wakeuuid-leak.c -framework IOKit -framework CoreFoundation -o wakeuuid-leak
	bazad@bazad-macbookpro ~/Developer/poc/wakeuuid-leak % ./wakeuuid-leak
	1. Sleep the device.
	2. Wake the device.
	3. Press any key to continue.

	current_wakeuuid: 0xd0ddc6477f1e00b7 0xffffff801e468a28
*/

#if 0
iOS/macOS: 16-byte uninitialized kernel stack disclosure in if_ports_used_update_wakeuuid().

macOS 10.13.4 introduced the file bsd/net/if_ports_used.c, which defines sysctls for inspecting
ports, and added the function IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey() to the file
iokit/Kernel/IOPMrootDomain.cpp. Here's the code of the latter function:

	extern "C" bool
	IOPMCopySleepWakeUUIDKey(char *buffer, size_t buf_len)
	{
		if (!gSleepWakeUUIDIsSet) {
			return (false);
		}

		if (buffer != NULL) {
			OSString *string;

			string = (OSString *)
			    gRootDomain->copyProperty(kIOPMSleepWakeUUIDKey);

			if (string == NULL) {
				*buffer = '\0';
			} else {
				strlcpy(buffer, string->getCStringNoCopy(), buf_len);

				string->release();
			}
		}

		return (true);
	}

checked, meaning that if we set the "SleepWakeUUID" property's first character to anything other
than a valid hexadecimal digit, we can get random stack garbage copied into the global
current_wakeuuid buffer. This is problematic because current_wakeuuid is a sysctl variable, meaning
its value can be read from userspace.

Tested on macOS 10.13.6 17G2112:

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
