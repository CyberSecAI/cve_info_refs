The first source indicates a potential out-of-bounds read information disclosure issue in Foxit Reader due to improper validation of user-supplied data during PDF file processing. The second source details an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability, where images from untrusted resources are loaded without proper user confirmation. Also there are other vulnerabilities described such as incorrect signature verification and information disclosure issues in Foxit PDF products while handling XFA documents."
