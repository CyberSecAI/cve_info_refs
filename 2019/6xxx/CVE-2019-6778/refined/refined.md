*    **CVE Relevance:**  This document is directly related to `CVE-2019-6501`, not CVE-2019-6778 and is thus considered **UNRELATED**.
    *  It does contain a description of the vulnerability:  "An out of bounds r/w access issue was found in the way QEMU handled inquiry request coming from a guest in scsi\_handle\_inquiry\_reply(). A guest user/process could use this flaw to corrupt byte of QEMU process memory." This is related to a different vulnerability in QEMU with out-of-bounds R/W.

*   **CVE Relevance:** This document is directly related to CVE-2018-19364, not CVE-2019-6778 and is thus considered **UNRELATED**.
    *    It does contain a description of CVE-2018-19364 : "hw/9pfs/cofile.c and hw/9pfs/9p.c in QEMU can modify an fid path while it is being accessed by a second thread, leading to (for example) a use-after-free outcome." This is related to a different vulnerability with a use-after-free in QEMU.

 *  **CVE Relevance:** This document is directly related to CVE-2019-6778.
    *   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap buffer overflow in the `tcp_emu()` function in the SLiRP networking implementation.
    *   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap buffer overflow in `tcp_emu`.
    *   **Impact of exploitation:** A remote user can cause a denial-of-service (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.
    *   **Attack vectors:** An adjacent attacker via a crafted packet sent to the emulated networking device.
    *   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network packets that can be processed by the vulnerable SLiRP implementation within the QEMU emulator.
