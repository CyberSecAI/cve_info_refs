{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in specific fields within the job edit form. Specifically, the Arguments, Invocation String, and File Extension fields in the workflow module are vulnerable.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the Execution Preview of the affected job.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting a crafted XSS payload into the Arguments, Invocation String, or File Extension fields when editing a job.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs valid credentials to log in to the Rundeck server. They must have the permissions to navigate to the job edit page and modify the vulnerable fields."
