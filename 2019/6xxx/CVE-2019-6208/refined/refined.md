Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6208:

**Root Cause:**
- A memory initialization issue within the kernel related to copy-on-write (COW) behavior of file mappings. Specifically, when a file is truncated to a size that is not a multiple of the page size, the kernel fails to properly invalidate pages that are no longer part of the file when performing COW deduplication, if the UPL_WILL_MODIFY flag is not set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of file truncation in conjunction with copy-on-write mechanisms.
- Lack of proper memory management invalidation when file size changes.
- The `vm_object_upl_request()` function in XNU does not perform COW deduplication when the `UPL_WILL_MODIFY` flag is not set during file truncation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious application can cause unexpected changes in memory shared between processes.
- A process can modify memory it shouldn't have access to by leveraging the copy-on-write vulnerability.
- Information leak by reading memory that should have been deallocated/invalidated due to truncation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating files and their mappings in memory.
- Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered by truncating a file that is mapped into memory of two different processes after a COW operation took place.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute code on the target system.
- Access to file system operations (e.g., `open`, `ftruncate`, `mmap`).
- Ability to establish inter-process communication (e.g., using mach ports).

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit is triggered via a file truncation (`ftruncate()`). When a file is truncated to a size that is not divisible by the page size, the `ubc_setsize_ex` function zeros out the end of the page. When requesting a UPL, the UPL_WILL_MODIFY flag is not set. This leads to the copy-on-write deduplication not being performed, leading to the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can also be exploited across mach ports using out-of-line (OOL) memory descriptors, where memory changes in a source process are not reflected in the receiving process due to incorrect deduplication logic during file truncation.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates a scenario where a child process modifies a mapped file after a copy-on-write operation has occurred, which is then read by a parent process.
- The vulnerable code resides within the XNU kernel.
