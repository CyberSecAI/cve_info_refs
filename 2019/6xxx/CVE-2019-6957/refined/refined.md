- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow located in the RCP+ parser of the webserver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input. The RCP+ parser does not properly validate the size of the input data before copying it to a buffer, allowing an attacker to write past the buffer boundary.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution (RCE) on the affected system. This can allow an attacker to shutdown and start services or access video data.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the network interface (HTTP/HTTPS) by sending specially crafted requests to the webserver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the webserver of the affected system. No authentication or user interaction is required (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N).
