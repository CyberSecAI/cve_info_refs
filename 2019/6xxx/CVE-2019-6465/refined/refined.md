Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-6465:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists due to improper application of access control lists (ACLs) for zone transfers in BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) when using Dynamically Loadable Zones (DLZs). Specifically, the `allow-transfer` ACL is not properly applied to DLZs when those zones are writable, which means that zone transfers may not be correctly restricted.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect access control:** The `allow-transfer` ACL, which should regulate which clients can perform zone transfers, is ineffective for writable DLZs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Unauthorized zone transfers:** An attacker can bypass access control and perform zone transfers even if they are not allowed by ACLs, which can be used to obtain sensitive information about the target domain.
-   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the entire zone file of a DLZ and gain information about the DNS records and the structure of the domain.

**Attack vectors:**
-   A remote attacker acting as a DNS client can send a specially crafted request to the BIND DNS server.
-   The attacker must know that a DLZ exists and that it is writable.
-   The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires network access to the DNS server running the vulnerable BIND software.
- No special privileges or authentication is needed.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability affects BIND versions 9.9.0 -> 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.5-P2, 9.12.0 -> 9.12.3-P2, 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition and 9.13.0 -> 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch, and versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated.
-   The fix was implemented in versions bind 9.11.5-P4 and bind 9.12.3-P4.
- This vulnerability has a low severity rating from Red Hat.
- This flaw can result in information disclosure by allowing unauthorized users to access DNS zone data.
