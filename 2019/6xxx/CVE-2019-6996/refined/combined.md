# Ability to Find Out Private Group's Membership by :group\_id

Adding [HackerOne](/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues?label_name=HackerOne) due a report we've received. In that use case, a user can add a private group and then view the list of members in the private group.

cc [@jritchey](/jritchey "James Ritchey") WDYT of S3/P3 for group member enumeration?

Title:         Ability to Find Out Private Group's Membership by :group_id
Scope:         *.gitlab.com
Weakness:      None
Severity:      Low
Link:          https://hackerone.com/reports/421906

Details:
**Summary:**
Usually everything about private group is hidden, including who is in the group, however the approval endpoint allow unauthorised user to add any group, including private group to be the approver. After adding private group to be approver, the merge request page reveal the membership of that private group.

## Steps To Reproduce:

* Open a merge request in a project that you have at least maintainer access
* In approver section, randomly select a group to be the approver, and set the number of approver to be 99
* click submit merge request and use burp request to intercept the request

```

```

Change the `merge_request%5Bapprover_group_ids%5D` value to any private group id, in this case you can use `3711378`, this is my private group, you can verify it is private by visiting <https://gitlab.com/api/v4/groups/3711378>

Then after the request, 302 will take you to the merge request page, and it will show the membership in approval status.
