GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6579

An attacker with network access to the web server on port 80/TCP or 443/TCP could execute system
commands with administrative privileges.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to
the affected service. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful
exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises conﬁdentiality, integrity or availability of the
targeted system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
