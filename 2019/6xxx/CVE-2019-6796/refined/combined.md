# Stored XSS in user status

**[HackerOne report #461607](https://hackerone.com/reports/461607)** by ashish\_r\_padelkar on 2018-12-13:

**Summary:**
Hello,

I found a stored XSS in user status which executes on issues, merge requests etc

**Description:**
If you add your status with xss payload at `https://gitlab.com/profile` as `"><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>` , it executes when you comment in issues merge request etc

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Save your status at `https://gitlab.com/profile` as `"><img src=x onerror=prompt(1)>`
2. Comment on any issue,merge request etc
3. Now hover over your name and it will open a tool tip where this status xss gets executed!

Regards,
Ashish

# Regression for XSS in User Status

The patch for [#55320 (closed)](/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/55320 "Stored XSS in user status") was not included in the 11.7.3 security release. Therefore, since it has been publicly disclosed and we should:

* Create a post-deployment patch for `gitlab.com`
* Include it in the upcoming critical security release.

Original Issue: <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/55320>

Security Issue: <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/issues/2786>

<https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/issues/2786#note_150471> captures why this was missed
