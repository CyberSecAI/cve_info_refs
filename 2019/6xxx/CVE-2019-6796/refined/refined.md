The provided content describes a stored XSS vulnerability in GitLab user status, which is relevant to CVE-2019-6796.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided status messages. When a user sets their status with an XSS payload, this payload is stored and later rendered without proper escaping, leading to script execution when the status is displayed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: User-supplied input (status message) is not properly sanitized or escaped before being stored and rendered in the web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the profile/status in the tool tip on comment section.
- Potential for account takeover, data theft, or other malicious activities, depending on the specific JavaScript code executed.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker modifies their user status via the profile settings page to include malicious JavaScript code.
- The malicious status is displayed when another user hovers over the attacker's name in comments, issues, merge requests etc. The script then executes in the victim's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs a valid account on the GitLab instance.
- The attacker must be able to set a user status.
