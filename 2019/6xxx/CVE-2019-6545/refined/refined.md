Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6545:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper control of resource identifiers, specifically a resource injection vulnerability within the custom remote agent protocol of Indusoft Web Studio and InTouch Edge HMI. The software loads a database connection file from a network share, and this file can be manipulated by an attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Injection (CWE-99):** The application improperly handles resource identifiers, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious database connection file.
*   **Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306):** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, making it easier for an attacker to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Remote Command Injection:** By manipulating the database connection file, an attacker can inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the IWS service account.
*   **System Compromise:** The ability to execute code can lead to complete compromise of the affected system.
*   **Data manipulation:** The attacker can access and manipulate data handled by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attack is performed remotely via network connections to the vulnerable software.
*   **Custom Remote Agent Protocol:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted command (specifically command 66) to the remote agent protocol, typically found on ports 1234 or 51234.
*   **SMB Share:** The attacker sets up a malicious SMB server that hosts the attacker-controlled DB connection file which is then loaded by the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system on the specified port.
*   **SMB Server:** The attacker needs the capability to host an SMB server to deliver the malicious DB connection file
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not require any valid credentials.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The exploit requires low technical skill to execute.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in InduSoft Web Studio versions prior to 8.1 SP3 and InTouch Edge HMI versions prior to 2017 Update.
*   The exploit is triggered by command 66, which leads the application to load a malicious DB connection configuration file over SMB, from an attacker-controlled share.
*   The crafted DB.xdc file contains an XML payload that utilizes a WinExec function call within the ConnectionString to execute commands.
*   The vulnerability is classified as critical due to the potential for complete system compromise.
*   AVEVA released a security bulletin (LFSEC00000133) addressing this and the related CVE-2019-6543 vulnerability.
