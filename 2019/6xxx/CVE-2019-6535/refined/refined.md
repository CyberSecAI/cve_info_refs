- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the affected product's uncontrolled resource consumption when processing specific network packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400), leading to a denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker can send specially crafted packets to the device, causing Ethernet communication to stop. This results in a denial-of-service condition on the PLC.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send specially crafted packets over several ports to the affected products.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and doesn't need any special privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. A low skill level is required to perform the exploit.
