Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-6716

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the LogonBox Limited's (formerly Nervepoint Technologies) Access Manager web application. The application fails to properly validate user authorization when accessing specific objects via the `jobId` parameter in the `/runJob.html` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application uses direct references to internal objects (identified by numerical IDs) without proper authorization checks. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `jobId` parameter in the HTTP request to access or interact with different objects they are not authorized to access.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable without any prior authentication, making it easily accessible to remote attackers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Active Directory User Enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate internal Active Directory usernames by accessing specific job objects.
*   **Active Directory Group Enumeration:** Attackers can potentially enumerate Active Directory group names.
*   **Manipulation of Back-end Server Jobs:** Depending on the system configuration, attackers might be able to alter back-end server jobs, like backup and synchronization jobs.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack is performed by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/runJob.html` endpoint, manipulating the `jobId` parameter.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable web application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the affected application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid user credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint and Parameter:** The attacker must be aware of the `/runJob.html` endpoint and the `jobId` parameter.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Access Manager versions >= 1.2 and <= 1.4-RG3.
*  **Fixed Versions:** The issue has been addressed in versions >= 1.4-RG4.
*   **PoC Example:** The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) shows a request like: `https://host.example.org/runJob.html?jobId=5` where '5' can be manipulated to enumerate resources.
