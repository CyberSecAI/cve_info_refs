- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The devices do not implement sufficient measures to prevent multiple failed authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts (CWE-307)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can discover passwords via brute force attack.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting the lack of account lockout/rate limiting.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the device, and does not require prior authentication or user interaction.
