## Remote Code Execution in SpamTitan

**CVE-2019-6800** is a vulnerability found in the anti-spam solution “SpamTitan” by TitanHQ that allows a network man-in-the-middle to execute arbitrary code as root. Affected versions are at least 7.x up until 7.03.

## Vulnerability

The vulnerability was first identified after the unencrypted downloading of shell scripts triggered an alert in network monitoring equipment. The traffic was part of the spam rule update process.

**HTTP-Response**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 24 Jan 2019 14:02:04 GMT
Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS)
Last-Modified: Thu, 24 Jan 2019 13:30:00 GMT

\! /tmp/fixit.sh
\! /bin/rm /tmp/fixit.sh

```

This response raised concerns regarding the security of this update process. A test instance of the SpamTitan software was deployed and quickly verified that the update process is indeed performed over unencrypted connections, and with no security measures in place. Using simple Man-in-the-Middle techniques we were able to confirm that injected code will let us execute arbitrary commands on the SpamTitan server with root privileges.

## Mitigation

Update SpamTitan to version >7.04 or disable the spam rule update process to mitigate this vulnerability.

[![Transcend Networks MSP Adopt Advanced Email Security Solutions for Critical Infrastructure](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Transcend-Logo.png)](https://www.spamtitan.com/transcend-networks-msp-case-study/)
## [Transcend Networks MSP Adopt Advanced Email Security Solutions for Critical Infrastructure](https://www.spamtitan.com/transcend-networks-msp-case-study/)

by [Jennifer Marsh](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/jennifermarsh/ "Posts by Jennifer Marsh") | Oct 22, 2024 | [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/)

Transcend Networks MSP is a managed service provider (MSP) that specializes in supporting clients with high IT demands. Their focus is on delivering critical IT services to customers who prioritize technology in their operations. By implementing SpamTitan and ArcTitan, Transcend Networks has enhanced email security for both their clients and their own business. Maintaining local U.S. email storage was essential for Transcend Networks, especially due to their work with government agencies. Previously, they relied on a cloud-based email security provider, but when the provider began routing emails overseas, this posed a significant problem. Transcend Networks sought a security solution that they could fully customize and manage to meet both their own and their clients’ specific requirements. As one Transcend Networks representative noted, “We’re MSP specialists and need a solution we can configure exactly as needed.” Recognizing the importance of a multi-layered security approach, Transcend Networks also required an email archiving solution to preserve emails that were not backed up by Office 365. This would ensure that, in the event of a security breach, they could provide full email data recovery for their clients.   According to John Penrod, Principal Engineer/VP Transcend Networks “SpamTitan and ArcTitan have been bulletproof in their ability to serve our and our customers needs”.

Key requirements for Transcend Networks included:

* Local email relaying
* Seamless migration for existing clients
* Customizable setup and configuration
* A high-quality, dependable solution

Transcend Networks implemented two solutions from TitanHQ’s security suite: SpamTitan and ArcTitan. SpamTitan serves as their first line of defense, protecting against phishing attacks, spam, and malware before they reach customers’ inboxes. Transcend Networks chose this solution for several reasons. First, SpamTitan’s private cloud enabled them to keep their clients’ email data onshore, meeting regulatory and client-specific requirements. The solution operates through two AWS instances—primary and secondary—both managed by TitanHQ, which gave Transcend Networks confidence in the system’s security.

SpamTitan’s high level of configurability was a key advantage. Transcend Networks could tailor the solution to their specific needs, such as downloading raw email logs and redirecting flagged spam directly into users’ Outlook junk folders. These technical capabilities set SpamTitan apart from other solutions. As noted by a representative: “The configurability with SpamTitan is far superior to what we’ve seen.” Transcend Networks also deployed ArcTitan for email archiving, both for their clients and their own operations. Its seamless integration with Office 365 simplified the email archiving process and ensured the retention of important data. ArcTitan provided an easy way for both Transcend Networks and their clients to track and access archived emails as needed.

With TitanHQ’s SpamTitan and ArcTitan, Transcend Networks now has a robust, multi-layered email security solution. SpamTitan not only acts as a strong defense against email-based threats but also ensures that their clients’ emails remain onshore, addressing concerns about data being relayed overseas. Meanwhile, ArcTitan’s archiving capabilities helped one client avoid legal issues by enabling access to crucial email data that would have been lost if relying solely on Microsoft 365 backup.

## [Bitdefender Anti-Virus Engine Incorporated in SpamTitan v7.00](https://www.spamtitan.com/bitdefender-anti-virus-engine-incorporated-in-spamtitan-v7-00/)

by [Jennifer Marsh](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/jennifermarsh/ "Posts by Jennifer Marsh") | Mar 5, 2018 | [Internet Security Updates](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/internet-security-updates/), [Spam News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spam-news/), [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/), [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-news/), [TitanHQ Partner News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-partner-news/)

A new version of TitanHQ’s [cloud-based anti-spam service](https://www.spamtitan.com/cloud-based-anti-spam-service/) and anti-spam software was released on March 5, 2018. SpamTitan version 7.00 includes patches for recently identified vulnerabilities in the ClamAV antivirus engine and a change to the primary AV engine used by the solution.

The primary anti-virus engine of SpamTitan version 7.00 is provided by the Romanian firm Bitdefender. Bitdefender is an award-winning antivirus engine that provides exceptional email protection against malware, viruses, and ransomware. Combined with the secondary AV engine – ClamAV – users benefit from excellent protection against email-based malware and ransomware attacks. The dual AV engines ensure malicious software is not delivered to end users’ inboxes via email attachments.

The change to Bitdefender was a natural choice and TitanHQ is planning to further its strategic relationship with the Romanian cybersecurity firm over the coming weeks and months. The change to the primary AV engine will be unnoticeable to current users, who will continue to be protected from malicious threats.

The update to the latest version will not happen automatically. Customers who have ‘prefetch of system updates’ enabled on their SpamTitan installations will be able to see the latest version in their list of available updates and can manually trigger the update to the new version. Customers who do not have that option enabled need to “check for updates” via their user interface.

Customers have been advised to read the documentation accompanying the latest version prior to installation as it includes important information on how the update should be applied. TitanHQ explains that it is not possible to update from v4 or v5 of the platform to SpamTitan version 7.00 without first installing version 6 of the platform.

Customers should note that the update must be performed before May 1, 2018 to ensure continued protection, as support for the Kaspersky AV engine – used in all versions of SpamTitan prior to v7 – will cease on that date. TitanHQ has also informed customers that support for v4 and v5 of SpamTitan will also stop on May 1, 2018.

SpamTitan v7.00 includes patches for the following vulnerabilities: CVE-2017-12374, CVE-2017-12375, CVE-2017-12376, CVE-2017-12377, CVE-2017-12379, CVE-2017-12380. All of those vulnerabilities exist in ClamAV. The latest version also improves protection against DoS attacks and should be applied as soon as possible. The update will take approximately 10-20 minutes to complete.

## [MSPs: Meet TitanHQ at this Year’s Datto Roadshows](https://www.spamtitan.com/msps-datto-roadshows/)

by [Jennifer Marsh](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/jennifermarsh/ "Posts by Jennifer Marsh") | Jan 16, 2018 | [ArcTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/arctitan-news/), [MSP News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/msp-news/), [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/), [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-news/), [TitanHQ Partner News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-partner-news/)

TitanHQ is pleased to announce that the team will be attending several Datto Roadshows this year, including the Datto Roadshow in Tampa on January 16, 2018.

The Datto roadshows are exciting events for managed service providers (MPS). Attendees get the opportunity to meet the Datto team and other managed service providers and gain valuable insights and useful advice to help turn 2018 into a highly profitable year.

The roadshows feature several deep dives, where the latest product releases and tech will be showcased to help MSPs get the most out of products and add new services to their stack.

The Datto Networking Deep Dive gives MSPs the opportunity to learn how to boost MMR with the most MSP-centric networking product line in the world. Datto will be explaining its industry leading cloud backup and data recovery solutions in the Datto SaaS Protection Deep Dive.

The current ransomware epidemic has companies crying out for solutions that can help them to prevent attacks and recover quickly when disaster strikes. This creates an ideal opportunity for MSPs to improve their bottom lines by offering ransomware protection and recovery services. There will be a deep dive on ransomware where attendees will discover best practices to adopt to ensure clients are protected and data are secured.

The Tampa event will also see the Passportal team on hand to explain how clients can be protected from the full range of current cybersecurity threats and how MSPs can help their clients prevent data breaches, while lowering costs and increasing value.

TitanHQ will be on hand to explain the opportunities that exist in [cloud-based spam filtering](https://www.netsec.news/cloud-based-spam-filtering/), web filtering and email archiving services, and how straightforward (and profitable) it is to provide these services to clients.

Additionally, the event is a great networking opportunity where MSPs can speak to other Datto partners and gain valuable tips to help them improve productivity, cut costs, and boost profits.

If you are unable to attend the Tampa event, don’t worry. There will be many other Datto Roadshows taking place over the coming weeks. The TitanHQ team will be attending several of these events.

## [SpamTitan Attracts Top Marks on Business Software Review Site](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-attracts-top-marks-business-software-review-site/)

by [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/titanhq-news/ "Posts by TitanHQ News") | Dec 22, 2017 | [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/)

Businesses have to deal with thousands of spam emails each day. Each employee may spend just a few minutes each day dealing with spam emails, but that time could be much better spent on other tasks. Multiply those minutes by the number of employees and it adds up to a significant loss of productivity.

At best, spam email is a nuisance and a drain on productivity. But it is not just nuisance emails that arrive in inboxes. Businesses face a barrage of phishing emails, and malware and ransomware are usually delivered via email.

All it takes is for one employee to be fooled by a malicious email for a network to be compromised, credentials to be revealed, and for files to be encrypted by ransomware. The cost of dealing with those attacks can be considerable.

The solution is to deploy an advanced spam filter that will scan all incoming messages for spam signatures, check email attachments for malware, and assess embedded hyperlinks that would otherwise direct employees to phishing websites and exploit kits. Spam and malicious emails are then quarantined, while genuine emails are delivered without delay.

## SpamTitan Attracts Top Marks from Users

To help businesses fend off spam email and ransomware attacks, TitanHQ developed SpamTitan. SpamTitan [anti-spam software](https://www.netsec.news/spam-filtering-for-business/) subjects all incoming emails to a Bayesian analysis. Emails are analyzed for spam signatures and the system ‘learns’ from new spam email campaigns ensuring it remains up to date and copes with new spamming tactics.

Greylisting is used as an additional spam control – Requests are made for suspect messages to be resent. Since spam servers are busy, the delay in messages being resent helps to identify and block more spam messages. These and other controls ensure SpamTitan blocks more than 99.9% of spam email, and ensure a false positive rate of less than 0.03%.

While many spam solutions are difficult to implement and troublesome to maintain, SpamTitan can be configured in minutes and has a low management overhead.

SpamTitan has also been attracting top reviews from users, in particular for ease of implementation and use, high spam capture rates, low false positives and for TitanHQ’s industry-leading customer service.

On the business software review website Capterra, SpamTitan has been awarded 4.5/5 points overall and has received top marks for technical support and customer service.

Some of the positive comments from users of SpamTitan are listed below:

*“I like that once you have configured it, you basically forget about it. It just works seamlessly and you don’t worry about it.”*

*“It has been great stopping emails that bring spam or ransomware. We used to get hundreds of bad emails and now we don’t.”*

*“The 100% uptime, ease of use, flexibility, customization options, seamless updates, clustering, and support folks who are easy to work with.”*

*“Wonderful product that I will recommend to every network/systems administrator.”*

*“It has taken so much workload off of our servers and IT staff. We still run all our security software and best practices but our AV software has barely caught anything with SpamTitan catching all the bad guys. “*

## Benefits of SpamTitan

SpamTitan is costs as little as $17 a month for 10 users and the solution requires no software downloads or hardware purchases. Setup takes just a few minutes and once it is up and running, there is next to no maintenance.

If you already have a spam solution in place and it is labor-intensive and complicated to use, you want to cut costs, or your solution has too many false positives and lets too much spam email through its filters, it is time to make a change.

If you have yet to implement a spam filter, claim back all the lost hours of productivity and improve your organization’s security with SpamTitan.

## [Gold Star SpamTitan Review in Recent Spam Filter Tests](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-review/)

by [Jennifer Marsh](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/jennifermarsh/ "Posts by Jennifer Marsh") | Oct 30, 2017 | [Spam News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spam-news/), [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/), [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-news/)

## New SpamTitan Review

Spam Filter Reviews, a website providing reviews of spam filtering solutions, has awarded TitanHQ’s SpamTitan with a glowing 4.9 gold star rating. The new SpamTitan review saw the product attract marks of 4.9/5 for both functionality and real-time emulation.

Each spam filtering product reviewed on the site is assessed on 18 different elements, with SpamTitan scoring highly on 16/18 of those elements.

The reviewers were particularly impressed with the ability to easily adjust scam scoring on all incoming emails, which allowed the [spam filtering](https://www.spamtitan.com/spam-filtering-service/) level to be fine-tuned to make spam filtering more aggressive or more lenient.

Another major plus was the ease at which quarantined messages can be checked. With any [spam filtering](https://www.spamtitan.com/spam-filter-office-365/) solution, there will be false positives from time to time. Virus Bulletin reviews have shown SpamTitan’s false positive rate is particularly low – less than 0.03%. However, when legitimate messages do trigger the spam filter, checking those messages is straightforward.

In its review of SpamTitan, Spam Filter Reviews explained the ease at which quarantined messages can be safely viewed from the admin console. Users can view simple metrics such as the message date, recipient, envelope address, and message size, but also more detailed information using one of four different tabs.

SpamTitan lets users view the full HTML message, as well as the entire SMTP protocol header. If the email is genuine, users can quickly and easily release the message for delivery and whitelist the sender’s email address to ensure future messages are always delivered.

As Spam Filter Reviews points out, the ability to view the full body of a captured message is absent from many spam filtering solutions. This feature can save admin staff valuable time.

SpamTitan also rated particularly well on reporting. SpamTitan allows users to configure an extensive range of reports, providing users with all the information they need to measure inbound mail flow metrics. Spam Filter Reviews explained that many leading spam filtering solutions do not have such extensive spam reporting functionality. The ability to configure quarantine reports to show all messages since sign up or those captured since the last scheduled report was also praised, and found to be absent in many other spam filtering solutions.

Accessing the SpamTitan console was also found to be easy, regardless of the device being used. Since the control panel is full HTML, it can be easily accessed on mobile devices, while the admin console was found to be intuitive and easy to use.

Set up was also a quick and easy process, taking just 13 minutes. “13 minutes is extremely good considering the we had a previously MX record TTL of 5 minutes, so there is a reasonable likelihood that, if the domains TTL had previously been set to a lower TTL, the set up would have been even quicker.”

The only down point was the lack of link re-writing functionality, although due to the high degree of accuracy of the spam filter, this negative was somewhat mitigated.

Spam Filter Reviews’ SpamTitan review summarized the product saying, “All in all, SpamTitan is a very stable, clean platform with many additional features which makes an admin’s life a lot easier to manage user expectations,” also explaining “It is our comparative opinion that SpamTitan’s system is extremely under-rated as it’s clean, accurate and functionality full features certainly exceed and surpass some of the most well know Products on the market today.”

## [Strong Growth Continues at TitanHQ with Large Influx of New Customers](https://www.spamtitan.com/strong-growth-continues-titanhq-large-influx-new-customers/)

by [Jennifer Marsh](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/jennifermarsh/ "Posts by Jennifer Marsh") | Sep 5, 2017 | [MSP News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/msp-news/), [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/), [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-news/), [TitanHQ Partner News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-partner-news/), [WebTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/webtitan-news/)

It has been a busy summer for TitanHQ. The company has been working hard to improve its award-winning cybersecurity solutions to offer even greater protection from the ever-increasing range of email and web-based threats.

TitanHQ has also been expanding its customer base and now protects an increasingly diverse range of companies from email and web-based cyberattacks. The summer has seen a swathe of new enterprise clients sign up and start using TitanHQ’s suite of cybersecurity products.

Many new enterprise customers have joined the TitanHQ community over the past few months, from SMBs to large organizations with thousands of employees. While each company has a different infrastructure and requirements, all share a common goal: A need to protect their employees, networks and data from cyberattacks.

TitanHQ would like to take this opportunity to welcome its new customers from the healthcare, hospitality, education, financial services and information technology sectors, a selection of which are detailed below:

## European Hospitals Group

[![](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cliniques-de-l-europe.png)](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cliniques-de-l-europe.png)Cyberattacks on the healthcare industry have increased considerably over the past two years, with many large healthcare organizations falling victim to malware and ransomware attacks. Many of those attacks occurred as a result of employees visiting or being redirected to websites where malware is silently downloaded. Preventing employees from accessing malicious websites is an essential, yet often overlooked, aspect of cybersecurity.

The European Hospitals Group recognized the risk of malware downloads and decided to take action. The hospital group employs 1,800 people across two locations in the city of Brussels in Belgium: St. Elisabeth in Uccle and St. Michel in Etterbeek/European Quarter. The multilingual hospital offers excellent care for patients and now has excellent protection against web-based threats with WebTitan. WebTitan is used to carefully control the websites that can be accessed by staff, blocking web-based threats and preventing inappropriate website content from being accessed via its network.

## US Beef Corporation

[![](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/US_Beef2-1.png)](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/US_Beef2-1.png)The hospitality sector has been extensively targeted by cybercriminals over the past year. Those malicious actors have attempted to gain access to sensitive customer data, commonly doing so via malware infections on POS systems.

US Beef Corporation is best known for its highly popular chain of restaurants: Arby’s. The first Arby’s restaurant was opened by US Beef Corporation in 1969. By 1995, the popularity of the restaurant chain saw it ranked as the 20th largest franchise in the United States. New restaurants continue to be opened and now the company has broken into the top ten franchises in the United States with 350 establishments, employing 7,500 members of staff.

US Beef Corporation recognised the need to protect its network from email- based attacks and prevent staff from falling for phishing attacks. US Beef Corporation chose SpamTitan Cloud as its [anti-spam solution](https://www.spamtitan.com/cloud-based-anti-spam-service/).

TitanHQ is now protecting the inboxes of all those employees from phishing and social engineering attacks and helps to keep the company’s network free from malware and ransomware.

## Burlington Edison School District

[![](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/burlington.jpg)](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/burlington.jpg)There is growing pressure on schools and higher education establishments to implement technological solutions to restrict the websites that can be accessed via their wired and wireless networks. Children need to be protected online and prevented from accessing potentially harmful website content such as pornography and images of child abuse. Web filtering is also an important element of CIPA compliance.

The Burlington-Edison School District recognises the important of technological controls over acceptable Internet usage policies, and has chosen TitanHQ’s WebTitan to prevent inappropriate content from being accessed by its 230 staff and 3,900 students across 6 schools in Skagit County, Washington.

## Miway Insurance

[![](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MiWay.png)](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MiWay.png)The insurance industry stores vast quantities of sensitive data on customers – a treasure trove of information for cybercriminals. Keeping that data secure and networks protected requires a range of cybersecurity controls.

Johannesburg, South Africa based Miway Insurance is a direct short-term insurance and financial services company offering a wide range of home and business insurance products. The company employs 3,000 staff members, the majority of whom require access to the Internet at work.

To protect against web-based attacks and prevent malware and ransomware downloads, Miway insurance chose WebTitan.  WebTitan is used to block access to malicious websites where drive-by malware downloads occur and to restrict access to unacceptable website content.

## TNS Group

[![](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TNS_Group.jpg)](https://www.spamtitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/TNS_Group.jpg)Stamford, CT-based TNS Group is a leading provider of managed IT support services in the Tri-State area and has clients throughout the United States and beyond. The firm was looking for a solution provider that could provide a spam filtering solution that could be easily offered to its customers to protect them from email-based threats.

Through SpamTitan Cloud, TNS Group can offer its clients an advanced spam filtering service to protect against phishing and social engineering attacks, malware and ransomware and keep inboxes spam free.

All the above companies have now had their TitanHQ products deployed and are protected from email and web-based attacks. If you are looking to improve your organization’s security posture and want to ensure your networks are kept malware free, contact the TitanHQ team today to find out more about the WebTitan web filtering and SpamTitan anti-spam solutions.

## [All McDonalds Restaurants in the Philippines Protected by SpamTitan](https://www.spamtitan.com/mcdonalds-restaurants-philippines-protected-spamtitan/)

by [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/titanhq-news/ "Posts by TitanHQ News") | Aug 15, 2016 | [Spam News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spam-news/), [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/), [TitanHQ in the News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-in-the-news/), [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-news/)

McDonalds (Philippines) is the latest fast food chain to choose TitanHQ as its partner to protect employees from phishing attacks.

McDonalds operates more than 500 restaurants in the Philippines and all of those restaurants will now be protected with TitanHQ’s anti-spam solution, SpamTitan. Under the terms of the agreement, TitanHQ has been tasked with keeping employee inboxes free from email spam and protecting its network from other email-borne threats such as malware and ransomware.

Email spam has declined in recent years following the take down of large botnets by international task forces, yet the threat from phishing has never been greater. The Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG) has recently released a report that shows phishing attacks in 2016 have spiked. In the first quarter of the year, APWG reported there were more phishing attacks “than at any other time in history”.

Phishing attacks have also become far more sophisticated, making it harder for employees to identify phishing emails. Unfortunately, all it takes is for one employee to fall for a single phishing email for a network to be compromised. Employing a robust and powerful anti-spam solution has never been more important.

SpamTitan was chosen to protect all McDonalds restaurants in the Philippines for the excellent level of protection offered, but also due to the simplicity of the solution. As McDonalds (Philippines) IT manager Ramon Rivera III explains, “SpamTitan’s best feature is that it simply works as promised with immediate results.  The product is incredibly powerful and yet simple to manage.”

The increase in phishing attacks and the rise in the use of ransomware has prompted many fast food chains to re-evaluate their cybersecurity defenses; however, it is not only employees that need to be protected.

McDonalds has recently announced that it will also be taking action to reduce the risk to customers who connect to its in-restaurant Wi-Fi networks. In order to protect minors, McDonalds will be implementing a web filtering solution to prevent users of its restaurant Wi-Fi networks from accessing pornography. All McDonalds restaurants are to be protected by a web filtering solution which will prevent inappropriate web content from being accessed by any of its customers.

McDonalds is setting an example which other fast food chains are following. After the decision to start offering family-friendly Wi-Fi was announced by McDonalds, Starbucks followed suit. The coffee shop chain is currently looking for a web filtering solution to ensure its coffee shop Wi-Fi networks are 100% family friendly.

by [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/titanhq-news/ "Posts by TitanHQ News") | Sep 29, 2014 | [Spam News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spam-news/), [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/)

**Galway, IE, Sept 29th 2014** – SpamTitan Technologies, a leading producer of business email and web security solutions, today announced the availability of ArcTitan, a powerful cloud based email archiving solution targeted at helping small and medium sized enterprises.  The solution integrates seamlessly with most existing corporate email mail servers in use today including including  MS Exchange 07/13,Lotus Domino, Kerio, MDeamon, Zimbra, Google Apps, Office 365.

In today’s corporate world, email remains the most critical business application. ArcTitan provides a simple yet powerful solution to offload email storage, streamline search and compliance needs, and give users permissions-based access to any email message. ArcTitan is simple to access and requires little administrative effort. These comprehensive features ensure ease of use and take the burden off of system administrators. With ArcTitan businesses have peace of mind that they have a secure copy of every email, even if deleted from servers”, said Ronan Kavanagh, CEO, SpamTitan Technologies.

With non-compliance regulations bringing fines and threats of imprisonment, businesses are looking to deploy systems that archive email communications in a compliant way. For many organisations, this can become an organisational and storage nightmare. ArcTitan helps organizations in highly regulated industries ensure compliance in the case of an audit. “Most archiving legislation now calls for a 7 year retention period, these regulations and penalties mean organisations are often under pressure to find a solution that allows them to comply but in the easiest and most affordable way”.

Outside of regulated industries, ArcTitan can help organizations comply with acts of legislation such as the Federal Rules for Civil Disclosure and the EU´s General Data Protection Regulation. Under the EU´s General Data Protection Regulation, organizations that collect, process or retain the personal data of EU citizens will be subject to privacy and security laws similar to those in regulated industries. Furthermore, with ArcTitan´s fast search and retrieval engine, data access requests allowed by the Regulation can be conducted quickly and more efficiently than with other data storage methods.

ArcTitan has been designed with both the flexibility and control organizations need to meet changing business requirements. The ArcTitan solution delivers the following benefits:

* Peace of mind –robust and redundant hosting as the Infrastructure is built on Amazons Virtual Private Cloud on AWS. We also do backups of our whole infrastructure.
* Complete Security
  1. Mail is fully encrypted, you can use TLS Encryption to send us your email, and when it is stored, it is stored encrypted using AES 128 encryption.
  2. We use passwords that are hashed and encrypted to control access with inbuilt certificate management and delegated management.
* Disaster Recovery – should it arise that any event destroys your on premises mail server with ArcTitan you have an off-site back up with a global enterprise level infrastructure
* Reduce IT Budget – ArcTitan removes the cost of provisioning, management and upgrading hardware. With ArcTitan all of these costs are removed.

**Highlighted features of ArcTitan include:**

* Unlimited cloud based email archiving including inbound/outbound/internal email, folders, calendar and contacts
* Comprehensive Policy based archiving, including customizable retention periods and policies based on user, content and attachments plus many more Email Discovery – Easy email, file, contact based search and retrieval.
* Full Email Audit Capabilities
* Outlook plug in – allow users search their archive from their Outlook clients.
* NTML based single sign on for Windows users Bulk email import from PST, EML, MBOX and MSG Bulk email export to EML, PST, MSG, PDF, TIFF format Restore, delete and print options
* Safe search and automated search options
* Active Directory, LDAP, IMAP and Google Authentication options

* SMTP, IMAP, Milter, POP Connectors

“Using the near limitless capacity of the cloud for email archiving and search makes perfect sense and with ArcTitan it just couldn’t be simpler, more secure or cost effective” said  Kavanagh. ArcTitan provides an extra layer of protection to the organisation. With ArcTitan Users can search, view and retrieve their email even from their own Outlook client. The solution also includes full email search functionality and legislative compatibilities for e-discovery, retention and audit compliance. The benefits far outweigh the low cost of setup (virtually nil) and ongoing costs.

## [SpamTitan Technologies will be releasing a new feature rich SpamTitan v6.01 in April.](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-technologies-will-be-releasing-a-new-feature-rich-spamtitan-v6-01-in-april-news-news-626/)

by [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/titanhq-news/ "Posts by TitanHQ News") | Mar 10, 2014 | [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/)

**Tampa, FL and Galway, Ireland – 10th March  2014.**SpamTitan Technologies  will release v6.01 in April, a feature rich release of the award winning spam filter  that offers considerable enhancements in usability, security and network management. With centralized management  and control, and flexible on-premises or cloud deployment options, SpamTitan continues to deliver incredibly  cost-effective and manageable capabilities.  SpamTitan 6.1 due to be release early April will offer businesses enhanced and even more powerful email security with additional outbound mail relaying features, improved Application controls, and multiple UI enhancements.

We're really excited here at SpamTitan Technologies," said Sean Doherty Senior Product Developer . "We've put a lot of time and effort into the creation and launch of SpamTitan 6.1 it will be so rewarding to see all that hard work come to fruition in delivering these new features to our customers."

As part of the release of SpamTitan 6.1 in April users will see the introduction of   advanced policy based rate controls which will allow the rejection or deferral of messages based on a number of criteria further protecting the system from spammers or spam-programs (also known as "spam-bots") that send large amounts of email to the server in a small amount of time.

SpamTitan 6.1 also sees the addition of support for sender based smarthosts. Sender dependent smarthosts provide the ability to relay mail outbound from a particular domain or email address through a specific relay or smarthost. This is used to ease the management of a single mail server with aliases, security, and Internet access rather than maintaining numerous local mail servers.

Another significant feature includes increased delegated administration functions and added support for outbound IP Delivery Pools providing increased protection for an organisations IP reputation and consequently increasing spam catch rate.

"Our mission here at SpamTitan Technologies is to provide secure, reliable and affordable email security solutions to our customers," said Eddie Monaghan, Channel Manager. "We're taking a very customer-centric approach to developing SpamTitan continually implementing customer feedback and feature requests into new product releases, I think that will really shine through in our feature-rich SpamTitan 6.1. Although the company hasn't specified an official launch date yet, we expect SpamTitan 6.1 will be available to all new and existing users within the next couple of weeks."

## [New Research on the Risks posed by Social Media in your Business](https://www.spamtitan.com/new-research-on-the-risks-posed-by-social-media-in-your-business-news-news-627/)

by [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/titanhq-news/ "Posts by TitanHQ News") | Mar 4, 2014 | [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/)

**Tampa, FL and Galway, Ireland –** **4****th Mar  2014.**  What are some of the threats to your network security from social media and should you cut off your employee’s access to social media sites? How can SMB owners or IT guys protect the network security of the company? [SpamTitan](https://www.spamtitan.com/solutions "SpamTitan") recently sponsored a survey by Osterman Research of 157 companies with an average of 1,470 employees as to perceptions about and experiences with malware.  Here we look at a couple of observationnewss drawn from that report related to social media.

### Perception of Social Media Threats

The survey shows that 14% of malware infections over the period November 2012-November 2013 were via social media and other interactive and collaborative type sites (i.e. Web 2.0).  The graph below presents the results.  As we can see, web surfing and social media are closely related in terms of the risks associated.  Web surfing is the number one method by which companies are infected, social media platforms draw victims in.

How do companies perceive the risk-versus-benefit of social media?

More than half of the companies surveyed regard the leading social media sites to be legitimate business applications.  This should mean they should not cut off access, because people might need those sites for their work.

Among the companies that consider these sites useful some have nonetheless written guidelines or implemented technology to these block these sites include:

* LinkedIn 21%
* YouTube 36%
* Facebook 40%
* Twitter 45%
* Skype 47%

As you can see, in the case of LinkedIn and Skype, some of these companies have cut off their access, yet they deem them useful.  This suggests that their security policies and business policies do not line up.  Contrast that with YouTube and Twitter where companies have not cut off when they should not.

### Network Security issues with Social Media in the workplace.

The major security threat with social media is the same as with spam email:  people’s curiosity, their sense of trust, and a lack of adequate security training. People have a tendency to trust these sites, because they are so well-known, considered reputable and people are not always aware of the dangers there. Plus there is the presumption to trust someone you know or someone who knows someone you know, which is how spammers gain access to post links on your wall. In security circles, the underlying issue is called “transitive trust.” The average popular website links to all sorts of sites and services, with the typical home page featuring lots of third-party links. Each of those links could potentially be used by hackers for malicious intent. Your website or service is only as secure as its weakest link – literally!. Transitive-trust hacking is not new. It occurs every time a banner ad running on an innocent website ends up linking to a malicious malware laden website.

The concept was considered in Clara Shih’s book ‘The Facebook era’  although a heavily business focused book it is very readable and supported by credible research.

She writes: *Consider this example of transitive trust: In trying to reach Graham, I discover that we both know Kelly. Because Kelly trusts me, and Graham trusts Kelly, Graham is more likely to “transitively” trust me if Kelly provides a warm introduction or I at least mention Kelly when reaching out to Graham. Not actually knowing me himself, Graham doesn’t trust me as much as he trusts Kelly, but … I don’t need him to trust me just yet. All I need is to get my foot in the door, and my product, service, or personality hopefully can do the rest. I just need a chance to be heard.*

Transitive trust is not a new concept; in fact, it is how human beings have been making important decisions since the dawn of civilization. The challenge in the past was about discovery. I might have had to ask a lot of people before I found someone who knew Graham well enough to provide an introduction. Social networking sites bring transparency and efficiency to discovering mutual ties.

Facebook and LinkedIn encourage you to friend or make contacts with people who you do not know directly.  They do this if you give them access to your email contacts plus they match you up with people who have a common contact with you on their site.  This way hackers can gain access to post message on your wall.  Twitter does not have this problem, as you cannot post tweets directly on someone else´s wall.  However anyone can post tweets and direct them to hashtags (#), which is where your employees would find them as they read about different topics.

LinkedIn and Twitter shorten the URLs you post there.  As they do this, they say they check for malware. For example, when they block a site, LinkedIn says: “This link has been reported as participating in malicious behaviour or abuse. Facebook also says they scan for malware, but that did not prevent the Zeus virus from infecting users on their site last year.  This virus waits until you visit a bank website and then steals your user id and password.  If that person is your company financial controller or bookkeeper, that could be a big problem.

### What about security issues relating to apps?

One of the inherent weaknesses with Facebook is that the apps that you install there can have access to post links on your wall.  So they can post seemingly harmless links to infected sites without the user knowing that. Your Facebook friends will then see that link.  Facebook has too many apps to scrutinize each carefully.

Finally, whatever defences you put in place, such as blocking sites completely or selectively blocking categories of sites – these are not going to work when people are using their own devices outside your network.  They can infect their tablet or smartphone and then send that out in company mail inadvertently with a web email client or when they attach via VPN and use their mobile device to send company.

Wrapping up, one can deploy technology and improve security training to help mitigate the risks of social media.   But it is probably not a good idea to cut off access to social media, as most business, news, and culture is or has moved online and people need to be able to gain access to that for work. Security is the most important focus area for business and IT decision makers in the context of their email and web solutions. Because of the significant potential for malware and other threats to impact organizations as they enter through corporate email systems, web applications, and social media tools – and the enormous potential for financial and other damage they can cause – decision makers must focus heavily on the specific solutions that will be employed, whether these solutions will be part of an integrated suite of solutions or implemented on a best-of-breed basis, and the models that will be used to deliver them.

The new SpamTitan Cloud service gives companies all the benefits of the multi-award-winning SpamTitan solution, without the high costs associated with deploying and managing local or virtual resources. With SpamTitan Cloud small- to medium-sized businesses receive unbeatable spam protection, improved network performance, and fail-safe reliability in an affordable package.

”Uptake of cloud computing is set to increase further in 2013 with cost savings and flexibility being the key motivators,” said SpamTitan Technologies CEO Ronan Kavanagh. “Today’s announcement marks the next generation deployment phase for the SpamTitan suite of email security solutions offering even more flexibility to our customers as well as increased efficiency, affordability and ease of use. We have always been innovative in our offerings – this takes that innovation to the next level.”

By using the SpamTitan Cloud service SMBs can configure SpamTitan to their exact requirements and be ready to block spam in minutes. Requiring no on-premises software or end user client software, set up is extraordinarily simple and quick. After account setup and MX record redirection to SpamTitan Cloud servers, email is automatically cleaned of 99.98% of spam, before any optional configuration changes.

Hosted e-mail services hold several advantages over their in-house counterparts but there are drawbacks as well. Each organisation needs to examine their individual requirement and circumstances before deciding on the best option. At SpamTitan Technologies we offer a full range of email security solutions including an appliance for in-house deployment as well as the cloud based service – both offering the same core functionality.

Leading on-line technology website *[Windows IT Pro](http://www.windowsitpro.com/article/messaging/Review-SpamTitan.aspx)*today announced the results of their recent SpamTitan review. The reviewer Nathan Winters found that SpamTitan was ‘ quick and easy to set up and works well with limited configuration. It has good granularity of policies and a simple UI for both administrators and end users.’.

Some of the key features of SpamTitan highlighted by the review included the granular nature by which policies can be applied. He noted that you can configure different spam- and virus-filtering settings for different email domains and systems.

## [SpamTitan announces support for 64-bit computing.](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-announces-support-for-64-bit-computing-news-news-408/)

****Galway , August 24th –**** SpamTitan Technologies now support running SpamTitan software on  64-bit machines. This introduction is as a result of growing requests from customers who have been seeing new servers coming to market with 64-bit processors as standard  as well as virtualisation software providers like VMware supporting 64-bit across their platforms.

Running SpamTitan on a  64bit processor allows for higher performance than is achievable with 32-bit processors, it also allows users to increase the memory above the 3.5GB limit set by 32-bit processors. The SpamTitan 64bit platform is ideally suited to ISPs who wish to extend their offerings e.g. to filter outbound mails to guard against customer’s being blacklisted due to spam attacks. The SpamTitan 64 bit platform can be easily clustered with the 32bit platform allowing so it can be rolled out as customers acquire 64bit hardware or 64bit virtual infrastructure without any disruption to their current installation.

SpamTitan has been designed from the ground up to meet the complex scaleability and management needs of ISPs and other managed email service providers. More and more this means operating in a virtualized environment as ISPs seek to optimize their server usage. “SpamTitan is one of the first vendors  to provide 64-bit support for virtual computing allowing ISPs the opportunity to extend their offerings.  There are few virtualized security solutions to offer such an extensive set of tools that are specifically tailored to the needs of ISPs,” said Kavanagh.

The flexibility offered by these tools along with the product’s reliability, capacity and tracking abilities is invaluable to dynamic environments such as ISPs where customers subscribe and unsubscribe on a continuous basis. Current users of SpamTitan can download a new installation from <https://www.spamtitan.com/download>, once SpamTitan has been set-up successfully 64-bit support is available. Support for 64-bit computing will be extended to the WebTitan solution very shortly.

Boston, MA and Galway, Ireland – 20 August 2010: Silicon Republic features analysis from SpamTitan Technologies in  this article which reports on recent legal and legistative developments and challenges  presented by social networking in the workplace and the continued blurring between work and personal.  [Read the full article here](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/careers-centre/item/17436-employers-struggle-with-the/)

Boston, Galway  15th June, 2010 : Failure by SMBs to adopt formal corporate social media policies, as highlighted by a survey by SpamTitan, could be storing up legal trouble for themselves in the not too distant future.

An audit of 200 SMBs worldwide revealed that while almost all allowed Internet access and some social networking applications in the workplace almost half (49 per cent) admitted they had not taken even basic steps towards a social media policy such as deploying a Web filter.

Many SMBs are now truly embracing social networking applications by adopted them within their overall marketing strategies. But it is almost impossible to track who owns this data as social data content is aggregated from site to site.

“As business embraces social networking as a way to propagate messages and build their brands the line dividing personal and company data is becoming increasingly blurred,” said Alastair Purdy, partner at Purdy FitzGerald Solicitors. “The important thing is to take steps to protect yourself or your company as much as possible in advance. Failure to do so will potentially leave the SMB sector with significant legal issues over data ownership.”

The legal position is at a very early stage of development. This is illustrated in a recent case involving the UK arm of a US business to business media publishing group (PennWell Publishing v Ornstein (2007 EWHC) ruled that the employer owned the outlook contacts of a former journalist employee even though this list contained both work and personal contacts some of which had been brought to the company by the employee.

This blurring between work and personal becomes even more problematic in the social networking sphere.  In another recent UK case a recruitment consultant moved confidential contact information to his LinkedIn account whilst employed at Hays Recruitment. This decision was one of the first to highlight the tension between businesses encouraging employees to use social networking websites for work but then claiming that the contacts and content remain confidential information at the end of their employment.

“We are in a new era and it is time for every company to include a corporate social media policy alongside internet usage guidelines as part of their employment terms,” said Ronan Kavanagh CEO SpamTitan Technologies ‘Without a clear internet policy many employees are unaware of the implications of sharing information on sites like Linkedin and if appropriate protection is absent many employers risk being drawn into costly legal wrangles with employees as time goes on.”

“Companies need to get to a point where they are managing employee behaviour at the individual level,” continued Kavanagh.  “Our WebTitan Internet filtering software for example is helping customers manage Internet usage in granular detail, thereby improving network security and reducing bandwidth demands in an easy-to-use, flexible and affordable way.”

WebTitan allows users to create and apply different policies to a limitless number of different workgroups.  It is possible to create flexible policies and permissions for different individuals, groups or departments within an organisation. WebTitan has a dynamic database that is updated daily with new blacklisted sites. The categorization database along with the anti-malware protection automatically update in the background at periodic intervals set by the administrator. Featuring extensive and customizable keyword filtering and comprehensive reporting, WebTitan has minimal impact on resources so as to help companies meet the challenge of staying secure in the fast changing world of social networking as cost effectively as possible.

## [SpamTitan ranked industry No.1 at blocking spam in Virus Bulletin’s January 2010 test](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-ranked-industry-no-1-at-blocking-spam-in-virus-bulletins-january-2010-test-news-news-388/)

by [TitanHQ News](https://www.spamtitan.com/author/titanhq-news/ "Posts by TitanHQ News") | Jan 11, 2010 | [SpamTitan News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/spamtitan-news/), [TitanHQ in the News](https://www.spamtitan.com/category/titanhq-in-the-news/)

Boston, MA and Galway, Ireland – 11 January 2010: SpamTitan Technologies, the makers of powerful yet easy-to-manage spam and web filtering software, today announced that it has again outperformed the leading industry brands in the latest Virus Bulletin Spam awards. In comparative tests featuring 15 of its nearest rivals, SpamTitan combined the highest spam catch rate with a very low false positive ratio.  This result earned SpamTitan the much coveted Virus Bulletin Award along with strong independent endorsement for its highly effective and easy to use spam filtering solution.

Virus Bulletin regularly conducts rigorous testing of anti-virus and anti-malware products to ensure the worldwide IT security industry stays equipped to protect users from the latest Internet threats.  SpamTitan, which runs as a virtual machine under VMware, was taking part in the Virus Bulletin test for only the second time.  In November 2009 SpamTitan picked up an award for the highest spam catch rate at the first attempt.  In January’s test SpamTitan again outperformed some of the industry’s best known brands including McAfee, MailMarshal, BitDefender, Fortinet and Symantec.

“In recent years, e-mail spam has grown from a mere nuisance into a multi-million dollar business for criminals and the business consequences of not blocking spam effectively can be very damaging,” said Ronan Kavanagh CEO. “Unlike many of our rivals, SpamTitan does not require customers to choose between preventing large volumes of spam on the one hand or prescribing a low rate of false positives on the other – with SpamTitan they get both.

“We are seeing a growing number of new customers moving away from other solutions,” he added.  “These independent test results prove that our hard work to ensure our customers receive the best possible protection from spam and viruses at an extremely competitive price is paying off.”

Two new categories of spam were added to the January test: those of ‘image spam’ and ‘large spam’. The former consisted of spam emails that contained at least one embedded image while the latter consisted of spam emails comprising a body size of at least 50,000 bytes. Both types of emails are notoriously difficult to filter, especially using traditional content scanning methods.

Martijn Grooten, author of the Virus Bulletin Anti-spam comparitive review stated that:  ‘the detailed results show that neither large spam nor spam containing images are a problem for (SpamTitan) and, as there were few false positives it earns a Virus Bulletin Spam award with the second highest final score’.

## [SpamTitan wins Gold in Virus Bulletin Anti-spam awards](https://www.spamtitan.com/spamtitan-wins-gold-in-virus-bulletin-anti-spam-awards-news-news-380/)

SpamTitan has achieved a Gold award on its first time to participate in the Virus Bulletin Anti-Spam Test. The Virus Bulletin is an independent global publication specific to the field of viruses and related malware. SpamTitan is the first anti-spam solution that runs on a virtual machine to take part in the Virus Bulletin test – demonstrating that SpamTitan is both an innovative and high quality product.

Virus Bulletin’s Anti-spam Test Director Martijn Grooten said in relation to SpamTitan  “I was particularly charmed by the simple, yet accurate explanations of the various [anti-spam](https://www.spamtitan.com/anti-spam-software/) rules.  **The fact that this approach worked well to block spam can be seen from the spam catch rate – which was among the highest in this test.  At the same time, the product had a very low false positive rate, missing out on a platinum award by just a single email; a VBSpam Gold award is more than deserved.”**

There was an increase in the number of products tested this month, and the benchmarks used for this test were stricter than in previous tests. To be the first virtual anti-spam solution tested in the Virus Bulletin anti-spam test and to come away with a gold award and a glowing recommendation is a testament to the quality of the SpamTitan anti-spam solution.
