**Root cause of vulnerability:** An input validation issue in a .dll file of RSLinx Classic where the data in a Forward Open service request is passed to a fixed-size buffer without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target device. This could lead to a complete compromise of the system, including the ability to modify control logic, cause denial of service, or exfiltrate sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted Forward Open service request over the network to the affected RSLinx Classic software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the target system running the vulnerable RSLinx Classic software. No specific privileges are required. The attack can be carried out remotely with low skill level.
