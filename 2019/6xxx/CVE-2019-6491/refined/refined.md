## CVE-2019-6491

- **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The RISI - Gestão de Horários (Schedule Management) software suffers from a SQL injection vulnerability in the login form. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: SQL Injection. Specifically, the txtUser parameter was found to be Union select (NULL) 4 columns and inline query injectable.
- **Impact of Exploitation**: Exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate the database and retrieve sensitive information, including potential LDAP connection details, possibly leading to privilege escalation on the domain if the authentication is badly configured. In the context of a Human Resources management software, this could expose sensitive employee data.
- **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the login form of the RISI - Gestão de Horários software. By manipulating the txtUser parameter with a crafted SQL injection payload, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs the ability to access the login form of the affected RISI - Gestão de Horários software. It's mentioned that the "Normal" authentication needs to be enabled to exploit this vector. Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques is required to craft the malicious payloads.
- **Details Beyond CVE Description**: The analyzed content provides specific details on the vulnerable parameter (txtUser), the type of SQL injection (Union select, inline query injectable), and the affected software version (3201.09.08 rev.23). It also highlights the potential impact on connected LDAP domains and mentions that the vulnerability has been patched by implementing input sanitization (int cast) on the server side and in the Javascript event.
