Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6973:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Sricam IP CCTV cameras' web server, based on gSOAP 2.8.x, is configured. It uses an iterative queuing approach (non-threaded operation) with a long timeout of 20 seconds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Non-Threaded Operation:** The web server processes requests iteratively instead of concurrently using threads.
-   **Long Timeout:**  The server has a timeout of 20 seconds for each incomplete request, which is significantly long. This is contrary to gSOAP's recommendation to use a threaded web server with a maximum timeout of 5 seconds.
-   **Queueing of Incoming Connections:** The server continues to accept and queue incoming connections even while waiting for the timeout on previous incomplete requests, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending multiple incomplete HTTP requests, an attacker can force the server to queue requests and wait for the long timeout, making the camera unresponsive. Each incomplete request adds 20 seconds of downtime. This effectively leads to a denial-of-service condition where the camera is inaccessible.
-   **Predictable Downtime:** The downtime is reliably predictable based on the number of incomplete requests sent.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   Sending multiple incomplete HTTP requests to the camera's web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Sricam IP CCTV camera.
-   The attacker does not need any credentials or prior authentication.

**Additional Information**
-   The vulnerability was reported to Sricam, but they stated that they do not provide support.
-   The maintainers of gSOAP were also informed and confirmed the misconfiguration.
-   A proof-of-concept exploit is available.
