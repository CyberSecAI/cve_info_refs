##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

[Sricam gSOAP2.8 DoS exploit proof of concept]

Proof of Concept code: Sricam\_gSOAP\_PoC\_exploit.sh

CVE-2019-6973

<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6973>

Thanks to the CVE Assignment Team for their help structuring the following:

[Description]

Sricam IP CCTV cameras are vulnerable to denial of service via multiple incomplete HTTP requests
because the web server (based on gSOAP 2.8.x) is configured for an iterative queueing approach (aka non-threaded operation)
with a timeout of several seconds.

---

[Additional Information]

Sricam IP CCTV Camera's are vulnerable to denial of service with
reliably predictable downtime, exploitable by sending multiple
incomplete HTTP requests.

I have spoken with Sricam who said they do not support this. I have
also spoken to gSOAP techs and the camera is vulnerable because
Sricam have configured their cameras to use an iterative webserver
with a long timeout of 20secs. gSOAP recommend to use a threaded web
server with a maximum timeout of 5 seconds.

---

[Vulnerability Type]

Denial of Service

---

[Vendor of Product]

Sricam

---

[Affected Product Code Base]

Sricam gSOAP 2.8 - 2.8

---

[Affected Component]

Sricam IP CCTV Camera gSOAP 2.8 webserver

---

[Attack Type]

Remote

---

[Impact Denial of Service]

True

---

[Attack Vectors]

Send an incomplete HTTP request. For each request the Sricam
implementation of the gSOAP web server will wait 20seconds before
responding - but the camera will still accept more incoming
connections and queue them. This condition can be exploited in order
to reliably cause denial of service.
