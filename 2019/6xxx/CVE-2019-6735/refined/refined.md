    "related_to_description": true,
    "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of PDF files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of the current process.",
     "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing PDF files, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
       "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can disclose sensitive information. This could be leveraged with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious PDF file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide malicious input to the application, either via a malicious webpage or a crafted PDF file.",
   "notes":"The advisory provides more information than the CVE description, specifying that user interaction is required and explaining the specific flaw."
