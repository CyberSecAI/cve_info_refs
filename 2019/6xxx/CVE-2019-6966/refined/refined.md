The provided content is related to CVE-2019-6966.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted MP4 file that causes the `mp42hls` tool in Bento4 to attempt to allocate an extremely large amount of memory using `LargeMmapAllocator`, leading to a failure and crash. Specifically, the issue occurs within the `AP4_Array::EnsureCapacity` function while parsing the 'elst' atom.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of crafted MP4 files leading to excessive memory allocation.
- Insufficient validation of the size of data within the MP4 file that is used for memory allocation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service due to the program crashing.

**Attack vectors:**
- Providing a malicious crafted MP4 file as input to the `mp42hls` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to the `mp42hls` tool. This would require a user to run the tool with a crafted file, potentially obtained by the attacker.
