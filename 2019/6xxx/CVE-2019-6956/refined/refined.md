Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-6956:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a global buffer overflow that occurs in the `ps_mix_phase` function within the `libfaad/ps_dec.c` file of the faad2 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Global Buffer Overflow:** The code attempts to access the `sf_iid` array using an index that can go out of bounds, leading to a buffer overflow. This happens because the `no_iid_steps + ps->iid_index[env][bk]` can result in a negative index.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:**  The vulnerability can cause a crash or abnormal termination of the application due to memory corruption.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As noted in the Gentoo Security Advisory, this vulnerability *could* lead to arbitrary code execution due to the buffer overflow, although this is not explicitly confirmed in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted MPEG AAC Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted MPEG AAC file to the faad2 decoder.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious MPEG AAC file to an application that uses the vulnerable faad2 library. This could be through a media player, a web service processing audio files, etc.

**Technical Details (from the github content):**

* The vulnerable code section is in `ps_dec.c`:
    ```c
    1512 c_1 = sf_iid[no_iid_steps + ps->iid_index[env][bk]];
    ```
*  The value `no_iid_steps` can be negative, leading to an out-of-bounds access on `sf_iid` array. The content shows a case where `no_iid_steps` is 7 and `ps->iid_index[env][bk]` is -9, leading to an access at `sf_iid[-2]`.
* The ASAN report confirms the global buffer overflow, showing that the access happens 8 bytes to the left of `sf_iid_normal`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in faad2 versions prior to 2.9.0, according to the Gentoo Security Advisory.
*   Debian LTS advisories also mention this CVE as part of several vulnerabilities fixed in faad2.

In summary, CVE-2019-6956 is a global buffer overflow vulnerability in faad2 that can be exploited with a crafted audio file, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
