Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a flaw in GitLab's notification system. Users are receiving email notifications about project activities (specifically, a project move in this case) even if they do not have permission to access the project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability exposes information about project activity (project move) to users who should not have access to this information, potentially revealing the existence of projects they are not authorized to see.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Unauthorized users learn about internal project activities and existence, violating project privacy and potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Potential Reconnaissance:** An attacker could use this to gather information about the structure and activity of an organization's projects. This could be a first step for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Notification System Flaw:** The primary attack vector is the faulty notification system. The attacker doesn't need to directly interact with the project. The vulnerability stems from GitLab sending out notifications to users who lack project access permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker doesn't need special access or privileges. The attacker needs to be an existing user of GitLab (or be included on some notification list), and the vulnerability is triggered by an event within GitLab, specifically a project move.

**Additional Notes:**

* The issue was reported and is being tracked under issue number 2777 on the dev.gitlab.org instance.
* The issue was reported in March 2018 and edited in January 2019, suggesting it is an older issue and that it's being addressed.
*   The user who reported the issue was sent an email notification about a project move, which led to a 404 error when they tried to view the project.

This information aligns with a vulnerability where GitLab inappropriately sends out notifications to users lacking the necessary permissions.
