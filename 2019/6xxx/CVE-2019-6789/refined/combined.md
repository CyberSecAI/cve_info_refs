# Receiving notification emails regarding projects for which I have no access permissions

Addressed by security (not merged yet) issue on dev.gitlab: <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlabhq/issues/2777>

I recently received an email notification about a moved project, one which I do not have permission to view.

I am unsure why this was sent to me, as I don't believe I was a member of the project. Accessing the link produces a 404, which tells me either it has since been deleted, or I am no longer a member (if I ever was in the first place).
