- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists due to a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it during the parsing of CXP files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by enticing the target to open a malicious CXP file or visit a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious CXP file or a malicious web page that the user interacts with. User interaction is required.
