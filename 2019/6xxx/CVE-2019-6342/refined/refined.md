Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-6342:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an access bypass condition that exists when the experimental Workspaces module is enabled in Drupal 8.7.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Access Bypass: The core vulnerability is that the Workspaces module, when enabled in the specified version, creates a condition where access controls can be bypassed. This means that users might be able to access content or perform actions that they should not have permissions for.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: Successful exploitation could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive information or perform actions that they are not permitted to.
- Integrity Impact: The vulnerability is also listed as having a potential "Some data can be modified" impact. This would mean that attackers could not only access, but change data within the system

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the Drupal web interface when the Workspaces module is enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special attacker capabilities or positions are listed in the advisory. It is suggested that all/anonymous users can exploit the vulnerability, which implies the attacker can be unauthenticated and not need a privileged position to carry out an attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is specific to Drupal 8.7.4 and the experimental Workspaces module.
- It does not affect earlier versions of Drupal (8.7.3 and earlier, 8.6.x and earlier, and 7.x).
- Mitigation: Disabling the Workspaces module.
- Solution: Upgrading to Drupal 8.7.5.
- Manual steps are needed after the upgrade for sites with the Workspaces module enabled.
- A cache clear is required on the site itself, as well as on any reverse proxy or CDN.
