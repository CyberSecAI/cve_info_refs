# macOS < 10.14.3 / iOS < 12.1.3 - Sandbox Escapes due to Type Confusions and Memory Safety Issues in iohideventsystem

#### EDB-ID:

**Vulnerable App:**

```
/*
It's possible that this should be two separate issues but I'm filing it as one as I'm still understanding
this service.

com.apple.iohideventsystem is hosted in hidd on MacOS and backboardd on iOS. You can talk to it from the app
sandbox on iOS.

It uses an IOMIGMachPortCache to translate between ports on which messages were received and CF objects
on which actions should be performed. There is insufficient checking that the types are correct; so far as
I can tell all the io_hideventsystem_* methods apart from io_hideventsystem_open expect to be called on
a "connection" port, but that's not enforced. Specifically, the service port is put in the cache mapped to
an IOHIDEventServer object, and each connection is put in mapped to IOHIDEventSystemConnection objects. Note that
the service IOMIG port can demux the whole hideventsystem service (all the methods.) This seems to lead to a lot
of type confusion issues (eg places where the code is trying to read a bitmap of entitlements possessed by the connection
but is in fact reading out of bounds.)

There's also what looks like a regular memory safety issue in
_io_hideventsystem_unregister_record_service_changed_notification.

This converts the port its called on to an object via IOMIGMachPortCacheCopy then passes that to
_IOHIDEventSystemConnectionUnregisterRecordServiceChanged.

This reads an object pointer from +0x10, which for both an IOHIDEventServer and IOHIDEventSystemConnection is an IOHIDEventSystem,
passes that to _IOHIDEventSystemUnregisterRecordServiceChanged and then calls CFRelease on it.

The problem is that this CFRelease call isn't balanced by a CFRetain, so each call to this just lets us arbitrarily drop references
on that object...

The PoC for this issue is trivial, just connect to the service and call io_hideventsystem_unregister_record_service_changed_notification twice.

You should enable guard malloc for the service to more easily see what's going on.

Tested on MacOS 10.14.1 (18B75)

// ianbeer
// build: clang -o hidcrasher hidcrasher.c -framework IOKit
// repro: enable guard malloc for hidd: sudo launchctl debug system/com.apple.hidd --guard-malloc
//        then either manually kill hidd or run the PoC twice so that the second time you can more clearly observe the UaF

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
