- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows users to comment on locked project issues by replying to notification emails, bypassing the intended access restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent access control, where the restriction of commenting on a locked issue is not enforced when users reply to email notifications related to the issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can comment on issues that are intended to be locked for specific team members, potentially leading to disruption, information disclosure, or other unintended consequences.
- **Attack vectors:** Replying to email notifications of comments made before an issue was locked.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have previously commented on the issue before it was locked and still have access to the notification email.
