# User can comment on locked project issues

**[HackerOne report #463938](https://hackerone.com/reports/463938)** by flashdisk on 2018-12-17:

Hi,

**Description:**
when project owner locks an issue on the project the commenting will be enabled only for project members but if a user commented on an issue before locking it, he can still comment on the issue through the notification email he got simply by replying to it.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. create a public project with a public issue
2. from another account comment on that issue and make sure you enabled the notification for that issue before commenting , in your email inbox you will see the comments
3. from the project owner account lock the issue to team members only which from any other account that is not a project member you will see this:
   [![locked.PNG](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/211de8689477271c57f30d8c46dabb214cede53d/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3436333933382f3339313634382f6c6f636b65642e504e47)
4. go back to the account user in step `2` and reply from your email inbox and you will see that your comment was added although you don't have the permessions to do so!

thanks!
