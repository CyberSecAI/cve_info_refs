Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-6539:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The software has a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability that can lead to arbitrary code execution. The specific weakness is the lack of proper bounds checking when handling user-supplied data, resulting in a buffer overflow when writing to a heap-allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some form of access to the system in order to trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing project files within LeviStudioU, where insufficient validation on the length of user-supplied data can be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable software.
- The attacker also needs to be able to provide a malicious project file to the vulnerable software.
- User interaction is required to open the malicious file, which is indicated by the "UI:R" flag in the CVSS vector string.
