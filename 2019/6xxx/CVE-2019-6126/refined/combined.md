Anyone can participate in the Peer to Peer MLM there is not restriction, many number of people will get into the system will get more earning to the system. In our Peer to Peer MLM where the user all are placed automatically (**Spill over**). User need get in to the system the user should **donation** 20 USD into the upline users after the registration the user will be in the basic **Level 1 Rank (JADE).** If the user needs to upgrade the **Level 2** user need to **donate** for their earning from he/she downline member’s **donation**. The position of the user in system will be conformed after the **48 hrs** of registration

**Feature and functionality**

We are here provided the main feature to P2P MLM,

**Peer to Peer Earning**

Peer to Peer (P2P) MLM system the user needs to donate to upline member or whomever the system instructed member, to get upgrade LEVELS. It will allow the user to give donation and get donation.

**Ranking System**

It is 3 X 4 Peer to Peer MLM systems, each individual user need to start into the system with the **LEVEL 1(ONE)** with the rank of JADE. This how the system is design so there is not illicit to get in to the system

* **LEVEL ONE (1) – JADE (Rank)**
* **LEVEL TWO (2) – SAPPHIRE (Rank)**
* **LEVEL THREE (3) – EMERALD (Rank)**
* **LEVEL FOUR (4) – DIAMOND (Rank)**

**Number of downline member**

As we have said it a 3 X 4 Matrix the every user need to completed the level to get the number of downline member.

* **1ST Generation – 3 (Maximum Downline member)**
* **2nd Generation -9 (Maximum Downline member)**
* **3rd Generation -27(Maximum Downline member)**
* **4th Generation – 81 (Maximum Downline member)**

**Time Frame**

Every user in the system need to donate them to the upline member or system give member with the time frame, which was managed by the admin.

* After registration with 20 USD users have **12 hrs** time frame to upgrade in to **LEVEL 1 (JADE)**
* After upgrading to **LEVEL 1** users have **72 hrs** time frame to upgrade in to **LEVEL 2 (JADE)**
* After upgrading to **LEVEL 2** users have **96 hrs** time frame to upgrade in to **LEVEL 3 (JADE)**

So the user in the system need to finish the level within the time line, otherwise the user will be blocked or deactivated his/her account in the system

### **Core concept:**

Let us consider the **user (A)** is new join person in to system. In registration user need to pick the package for the **donation** of **20 USD** to the upline user. The system will place the user automatically in to the system **(spillover) form left to right.** If the user is a first user in the system he will donate the amount to the system for upgrading else for upline members. After getting in to the system here are steps follows,

**Step 1:** **User (A)** needs to get in to system by donation 20 USD**. User (A)** is now upgraded to the level 1and rank is **JADE. 20 UDS** will be donated to the upline member.

**Step 2:** It is 3 X 4 matrix MLM system every user in the **level 1** will have the three **(3) downline partner.**

**Step 3:**  Each downline member for the **user (A)** will be donate the 20 USD to the **user (A)** it will make **60 USD** earning to **user (A).**

**Step 4:** After earning to the 60 USD, user (A) need to upgrade to **Level 2** Rank **SAPPHIRE. 40 USD** will be taking for the upgrade fee remaining 20 USD will be withdrawn by the user.

**Setp5:** After the upgrading to the **Level 2 to the Rank SAPPHIRE,** user will get the **(9)** **downline partner.**

**Step 6:** In Level 2 the **user (A)** can earn **360 USD** from their downline members, that means the user (A) downline member need to **upgrade their level** so they will give **donate earning money** to their upline member to **user (A). 40 x 9 = 360 (thrice the amount of investment)**

**Step 7:** After earning the 360 USD, user (A) need to upgrade to **Level 3** Rank **EMERALD. 160 USD** will be taking for the upgrade fee.

**Step 8:** After the upgrading to the **Level 3 to the Rank EMERALD,** user will get the **(27)** **downline partner.**

**Step 9:** User (A) will in the **Level 3 can** earn **4,320** **USD** from their downline members. Same like in the step 6 the downline user need to upgrade their levels so they will donate the 160 to **user (A). 160 x 27 = 4,320**

**Step 10:** Again the user (A) need to upgrade to the last **Level 4 to the Rank DIAMOND** to the user (A). From earning user need to donate **1,000 USD.**

**Step 11:** After the upgrading to the **Level 4 to the Rank DIAMOND,** user will get the **(81)** **downline partner.** From them the user will earn **81,000 USD**

**Step 12:** After completion of all the Levels the user need to donate **10,000 USD to the system,** after donation user can able to withdraw the earning amount.

Here are the 12 steps need to followed by the every user, how is get in to the system.
