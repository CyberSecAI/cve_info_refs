- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect permission handling in `MergeRequestsController` allowing Guest users to access merge request lists at the group level, despite documented restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control; Guest users are granted read access to merge request lists which they should not have based on documented permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Guest users can view the titles and creators of merge requests within a group, information which should be restricted to higher-level users.
- **Attack vectors**: Direct navigation to the group's merge request list URL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a Guest user within the GitLab group.
