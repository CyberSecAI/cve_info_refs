# Guests can see list of merge requests

The following issue was reported via [HackerOne](/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues?label_name=HackerOne).

It appears that `MergeRequestsController` is using similar permissions to issues that should not be granted to `Guest` users.

---

Details:
**Summary:**
Hello,

As per this document <https://gitlab.com/help/user/permissions> , A user with `Guest` role in a group can not see list of merge requests. However, it is still visible to them if they navigate to root of Group merge requests which i think is a bug!

**Description:**
When user is assigned with `Guest` Role in a group, they can not see list of merge request as per documentation. It is true that they can not see the list of merge request if they navigate to projects.

But it is still visible to them at the root url of group's merge requests list

`https://gitlab.com/groups/<GroupName>/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all`

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. A user with `Guest` roles can directly navigate to `https://gitlab.com/groups/<GroupName>/-/merge_requests?scope=all&utf8=%E2%9C%93&state=all`
2. They shall see list of merge requests names and created by names which should not be visible to them

Regards,
Ashish
