- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the ASN.1 parser of the Samsung Galaxy S9. When parsing ASN.1 strings, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow due to insufficient length validation of user-supplied data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by tricking the user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious page or file to the user. User interaction is required for exploitation.
