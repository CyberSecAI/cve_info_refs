**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')" (CWE-77). This is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Command Injection:** The software fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before incorporating it into commands, allowing for the injection of malicious commands.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation of this command injection vulnerability can lead to **remote code execution**. This means an attacker could potentially gain full control over the affected system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is **remote** and requires **low skill level** to exploit. The vulnerability can be triggered over the network.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
