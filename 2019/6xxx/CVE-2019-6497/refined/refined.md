Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing the SQL query in `controller/fetchpwd.php`. Specifically, the `username` parameter is directly concatenated into the SQL query string within the `find` function, without using prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability is present due to the direct concatenation of the `username` parameter into the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the SQL query through the `username` parameter, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database)
    - Data modification (altering or deleting data)
    - Authentication bypass (gaining unauthorized access)
    - Other database manipulation or server-side attacks (depending on database privileges)

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is via the `username` parameter sent to `controller/fetchpwd.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint and control the value of the `username` parameter. No prior authentication or specific position is explicitly required, suggesting the attack is possible on publicly accessible endpoints.
