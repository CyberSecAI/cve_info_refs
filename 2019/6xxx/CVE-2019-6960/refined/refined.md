- **Root cause of vulnerability:** GitLab does not properly disable the internal wiki when an external wiki service is enabled or when the wiki feature is disabled in project settings.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inconsistent access control: The internal wiki remains accessible through various methods (web interface, API, Git) even when an external wiki is configured or the wiki is disabled.
    - Inadequate feature disabling: Disabling the wiki via project settings does not fully prevent access to the internal wiki data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized access to internal wiki content.
    - Potential exposure of private information stored in the internal wiki.
    - Ability to create, modify, or delete wiki pages, even when the feature is intended to be disabled.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Web interface: Accessing the wiki through a direct URL (`https://mygitlab.com/<namespace>/<project-name>/wikis/home`).
    - API: Using API requests to retrieve and manipulate wiki data.
    - Git: Cloning the wiki repository via Git.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to have access to the GitLab project. This includes users with project access and potentially users with lower level access based on the project permissions.
