Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6224:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A buffer overflow issue occurs when processing a malformed RTP video stream in FaceTime, specifically related to processing textures. The overflow may be triggered during the splitting of RED packets within the `VCAudioReceiver_SplitRedPacket` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer Overflow
- Memory corruption

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution. A remote attacker can initiate a FaceTime call that could lead to arbitrary code execution on the target device.
- Denial of service. The overflow can lead to a crash in the `CoreVideo` process due to an `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` exception.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote, by initiating a FaceTime call with a malicious payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to initiate a FaceTime call to a target device.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a malformed RTP video stream as part of the call.

**Additional details:**
- The issue affects FaceTime on iOS, macOS and watchOS.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of textures from the malicious RTP stream.
- The provided exploit-db entry includes a detailed stack trace showing the crash point, and instructions for reproducing the issue on a macOS device using a custom library to modify AVConference and IDSFoundation framework.
- The patch involves improved memory handling.
- The crash occurs in `CVMetalTextureBacking::releaseBackingUsage()` after various calls within the `CoreVideo`, `VideoToolbox`, and `CMIOUnits` frameworks when a malformed video stream is being processed.
- The exploit-db entry suggests the root cause might be an overflow in splitting RED packets in the `VCAudioReceiver_UpdateAudioPacketWithRedPayload` function.
