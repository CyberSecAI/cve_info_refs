Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The Android application "NTV News24" fails to properly verify SSL server certificates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Certificate Validation (CWE-295):** The application does not adequately check the validity of SSL/TLS certificates presented by the server. This means it might accept invalid or forged certificates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker positioned between the application and the legitimate server can intercept and potentially modify encrypted communication.
*   **Eavesdropping:** The attacker can decrypt and read the communication between the app and the server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attack is conducted over a network.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the application and the server. A common scenario is the attacker setting up a malicious wireless access point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network path as the device running the vulnerable app.
*   **Interception Capability:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate network traffic (e.g., by setting up a rogue Wi-Fi access point).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects versions of the NTV News24 Android app prior to version 3.0.0.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.8 (Medium), and the CVSS v2 base score is 4.0 (Medium).
*   The vulnerability was reported by Shinnosuke Tokusho of Cryptography Laboratory,Department of Information and Communication Engineering,Tokyo Denki University to IPA.
