Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6131:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of a recursion depth check within the `svg_run_element`, `svg_run_use_symbol`, and `svg_run_use` functions in the `svg_run.c` file of MuPDF. This allows for the possibility of infinite recursion when processing a crafted SVG file with nested `<use>` elements or symbols, leading to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability: The absence of a check on recursion depth allows an attacker to trigger a stack overflow by creating an SVG file with recursively nested `<use>` tags or symbols.
- Infinite recursion: The lack of a mechanism to prevent cyclic calls to `svg_run_element`, `svg_run_use_symbol`, and `svg_run_use` functions, due to nested use tags and symbols, results in excessive stack consumption and ultimately the stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a stack overflow, causing the application (e.g., `mutool`) to crash, thus resulting in a denial of service.
- Application crash: The stack overflow results in a segmentation fault, causing the application to terminate abruptly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious SVG file: The attacker can craft a malicious SVG file containing nested or recursive `<use>` tags that trigger the infinite recursion during parsing, which causes a stack overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted SVG file to be processed by the vulnerable MuPDF application. This can be through various means such as opening a malicious SVG file locally, serving it through a website, or including it in another document format (e.g., a PDF).
- No specific position is needed other than having the ability to supply the malicious input.

**Additional Technical Details**
- The bug is triggered within the `svg_run_element` function of `svg-run.c`.
- The vulnerability was identified via AddressSanitizer (ASan) which detected a stack-overflow while running `mutool`.
- The fix involves adding a recursion depth check with a `MAX_USE_DEPTH` limit within the `svg_run_use` function. The counter is incremented before the call to `svg_parse_common` and if the limit is reached a warning is produced and the function returns. The state variable is initialized to zero in `svg_run_document`.
