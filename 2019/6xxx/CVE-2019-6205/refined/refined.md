  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-6205",
    "description": "A memory corruption issue was addressed with improved lock state checking.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Kernel"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a race condition in the `vm_map_copyin_internal` function. Specifically, an optimization intended to move memory entries from a source map to a copy is not atomic. This occurs due to the locking strategy of the function: the lock on the source map is dropped and reacquired during the copy process. This allows another thread to modify the source map concurrently, potentially leading to an entry being 'moved' multiple times, resulting in the same entry appearing in different memory copies.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Race Condition",
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU)"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious application may cause unexpected changes in memory shared between processes. This could lead to a TOCTOU vulnerability where one process writes to memory while another process is reading it, without the expected copy-on-write behavior.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious application can exploit the race condition by sending multiple mach messages in parallel, each with out-of-line memory regions that overlap. The overlap should include an anonymous memory entry. This causes the vulnerable code to attempt to move the shared entry multiple times via the optimization.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to execute a malicious application on the system. They would also need to manipulate mach messages to trigger the vulnerable code path. "
