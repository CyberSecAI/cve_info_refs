  "summary": "The vulnerability in Foxit Reader and Foxit PDF Editor is due to the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing XFA Template objects. This allows for out-of-bounds writes, potentially enabling arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process. Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious PDF file or visiting a malicious webpage."
