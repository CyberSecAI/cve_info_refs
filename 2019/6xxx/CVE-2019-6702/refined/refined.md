Based on the provided content, here's the information about CVE-2019-6702:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Qkr! with MasterPass iOS application (versions 5.0.6 and below) does not properly validate the SSL certificate it receives when connecting to the application login server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient SSL certificate validation. The application fails to verify the authenticity of the SSL certificate presented by the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks: An attacker can intercept communication between the app and the server by presenting a bogus SSL certificate.
- Sensitive data exposure: The attacker can capture sensitive information transmitted through the connection without the user's knowledge.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle (MITM): An attacker needs to position themselves between the client (iOS app) and the server to intercept network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the iOS device running the vulnerable application and the application's server. This could be achieved by being on the same network (e.g., public Wi-Fi) or by compromising network infrastructure.

The vulnerability is fixed in version 5.0.8 and later of the Qkr! with MasterPass iOS application.
