### CVE-2019-6015

The content is related to CVE-2019-6015.

**Root Cause:** FON routers are configured as open resolvers. An open resolver is a DNS resolver that answers recursive DNS queries from any source on the internet.

**Vulnerability:** The FON routers behave as open resolvers.

**Impact:** The routers can be leveraged for DNS amplification attacks against other entities.

**Attack Vector:** Attackers can send DNS queries to the vulnerable FON routers, which will then forward the amplified requests to a target, causing a denial-of-service.

**Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable FON routers. No authentication is required.
