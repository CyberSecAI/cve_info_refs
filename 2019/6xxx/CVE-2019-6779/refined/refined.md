The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF protection in the `links/save` endpoint of the application. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated admin user, can submit a forged request to modify friend links without the admin's knowledge or consent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability. The application does not validate the origin of the requests sent to the `links/save` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can add, modify, or delete friend links on the website. This could lead to:
    - Injecting malicious URLs in the friend links section of the web page.
    - Defacing the website by altering its friend links.
    - Phishing attacks by redirecting users to attacker-controlled websites through modified links.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious HTML page that can be hosted on a third party website. The malicious HTML contains a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. This page is sent to the authenticated admin user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick an authenticated admin user into visiting a webpage that contains the malicious CSRF exploit.
- The attacker does not need to be logged into the application.
