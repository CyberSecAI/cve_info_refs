_xpc_serializer_unpack in libxpc parses mach messages which contain xpc messages.

There are two reasons for an xpc mach message to contain descriptors: if the message body is large, then it's sent as
a MACH_MSG_OOL_DESCRIPTOR. Also if the message contains other port resources (eg memory entry ports) then
they're also transfered as MACH_PORT_OOL_PORT descriptors.

Whilst looking through a dump of system mach message traffic gathered via a dtrace script I noticed something odd:
It's possible for a message to have the MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX bit set and also have a msgh_descriptor_count of 0.

Looking at ipc_kmsg_copyin_body you can see that this is in fact the case.

This is a kinda surprising fact, and I think there are likely to be multiple places where developers are going to
have assumed that there must be at least one descriptor if MACH_MSGH_BITS_COMPLEX is set.

It turns out that libxpc does exactly that in _xpc_serializer_unpack:

__text:0000000000007016                 cmp     dword ptr [rbx], 0        ; rbx points to the start of the mach message

The code the goes on to read up to 0xffffffff port descriptors, storing the names and dispositions in two arrays.

By specifying an invalid disposition we can stop the loop, the serializer will then return an error and be destructed
which will cause names read from our fake descriptors to be passed to mach_port_deallocate().

You can test this PoC by attached lldb to the chosen target, setting a breakpoint on mach_port_deallocate and waiting
for the port name 0x414141 to be passed in rsi.

There is one mitigating factor which might prevent this from being exploitable on iOS: the underflowed value is used for two memory allocations
so you need to be able to reserve around 32G of RAM, on MacOS this is no problem but doesn't seem to be so easy on my XS.

Still, it would be a nice sandbox escape on MacOS.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
