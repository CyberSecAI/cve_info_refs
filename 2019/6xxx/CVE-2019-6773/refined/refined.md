    "CVE": "CVE-2019-6773",
    "content": "The provided content primarily describes various security updates and vulnerabilities addressed in different versions of Foxit products, along with some general product and company information from both Trend Micro and Foxit. However, within the Foxit security bulletins, several vulnerabilities are detailed, and they do contain information relevant to CVE-2019-6773 based on the ZDI advisory. Specifically the content from 'www.zerodayinitiative.com_639849f3_20250120_232513.html' directly relates to the CVE.\n\n- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in the way Foxit Reader handles the `richValue` property of a Field object within AcroForms. The application fails to validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it, leading to a use-after-free condition.\n\n- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-After-Free vulnerability. Specifically, the lack of validating the existence of an object before operations on it. Improper handling of the `richValue` property of a Field object in AcroForms.\n\n- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers could potentially disclose sensitive information from the target system. Additionally, in conjunction with other vulnerabilities, an attacker could achieve remote code execution.\n\n- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers could exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is needed to exploit this vulnerability (e.g., opening a malicious file).\n\n- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to convince the user to open a malicious file or visit a malicious page. No special network position is necessary."
