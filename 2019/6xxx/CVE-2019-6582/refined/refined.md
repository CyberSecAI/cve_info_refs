- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper authorization checks for modifying user-defined event properties.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing or insufficient authorization controls allow an authenticated attacker to modify event properties.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation compromises the integrity of user-defined event properties and the availability of corresponding functionality. Specifically, the attacker can change user-defined event properties without proper authorization, leading to a loss of data integrity and potential disruption of features relying on these properties.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to port 80/TCP.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An authenticated attacker with network access to the affected service.
