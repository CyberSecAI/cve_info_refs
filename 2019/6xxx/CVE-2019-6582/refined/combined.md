PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siveillance VMS is a powerful IP VMS (Video Management Station) platform family scaling from smaller
to large complex deployments. The Siveillance VMS portfolio consists of four versions, Siveillance VMS
50, 100, 200 and 300, addressing the speciﬁc needs of small and medium size solutions up to large
complex deployments.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6580

An attacker with network access to port 80/TCP could change device properties without authorization.
No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Successful exploitation compromises
conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the targeted system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6582

An attacker with network access to port 80/TCP can change user-deﬁned event properties without
proper authorization.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated attacker with network access to
the affected service. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. Success-
ful exploitation compromises integrity of the user-deﬁned event properties and the availability of
corresponding functionality.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
