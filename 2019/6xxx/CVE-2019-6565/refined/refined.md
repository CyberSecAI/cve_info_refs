Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6565:

**CVE-2019-6565** is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting Moxa IKS and EDS series industrial switches.

*   **Root Cause:** The device fails to properly validate user input. This lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

*   **Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser when they interact with the vulnerable web interface of the device.

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to execute malicious scripts. This can lead to various impacts, including:
    *   Stealing user session cookies
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Potentially gaining further access to the device or the network it resides on.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack is performed remotely via the web interface of the Moxa switches.
    *   The attacker injects malicious script into user input fields/parameters.
    *   The malicious script is then executed when a user interacts with the affected part of the web interface.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker can be either unauthenticated or authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted input to the vulnerable web interface of the device.
    *   User interaction is required to trigger the XSS payload. The attacker needs to trick a user into accessing a crafted URL or web page containing malicious content.
