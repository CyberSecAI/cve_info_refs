Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the PHPSHE V1.7 shopping system's admin panel. Specifically, the `state` parameter in the `admin.php` file is vulnerable when processing order lists.
*   The `_dowhere` function in `db.class.php` is responsible for constructing the SQL query but fails to sanitize user-provided input, allowing malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, where user-supplied input is directly incorporated into a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize the `state` parameter before using it in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to read sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers might be able to modify or delete data in the database
*   **Potential Full System Compromise:** In some instances, attackers might gain deeper access to the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter:** The vulnerability is triggered via an HTTP GET request to `admin.php` by manipulating the `state` parameter. For example: `admin.php?mod=order&state=wtuan' AND 3809=(SELECT (CASE WHEN (3809=3809) THEN 3809 ELSE (SELECT 6050 UNION SELECT 8971) END))-- LULI`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application, typically by targeting the website.
*   **Knowledge of the Application:** The attacker would need knowledge of the vulnerable parameter (`state`).
*   **Basic SQL knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of SQL to construct a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability using `sqlmap`.
*   The exploit involves using a boolean-based blind SQL injection technique.
*   The vulnerable code is traced through `admin.php`, `order.php`, and `db.class.php` where the SQL query is built.
