- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of user input validation when processing project files in Delta Industrial Automation CNCSoft. This can lead to an out-of-bounds read condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125). The software does not properly validate user input when processing project files, allowing an attacker to cause the software to read memory outside of allocated buffers.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause a buffer overflow, leading to information disclosure or a crash of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious project file to the CNCSoft application. The attack vector is considered local, requiring a user to open a malicious file. The attacker does not need special privileges, but user interaction is required to open the crafted file.
