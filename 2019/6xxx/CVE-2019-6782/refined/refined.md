- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The GitLab API endpoint for retrieving contributed projects (`/users/:username/contributed.json`) was not respecting user privacy settings, specifically the "private profile" setting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inconsistent enforcement of privacy settings across the user interface and API. The user interface would hide the contributed projects as expected but the API endpoint was still exposing the data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could use the API to view the contributed projects of a user who had enabled a private profile, revealing their involvement in those projects. This would allow an attacker to see the projects that a user had contributed to, even though the user intended for this information to be private.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending an API request to the vulnerable endpoint, `/users/:username/contributed.json`, with a targeted user's username.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know a target user's username and be able to send API requests to GitLab. They do not need to be authenticated to GitLab to exploit this vulnerability.
