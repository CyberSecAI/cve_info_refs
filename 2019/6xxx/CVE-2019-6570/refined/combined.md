VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-14618

The libcurl library versions 7.15.4 to and including 7.61.0 are vulnerable to a buffer overrun. The ﬂaw
is caused by an improper calculation of the required buffer size in the Curl_ntlm_core_mk_nt_hash
function of libcurl.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker providing a malicious HTTP server.
