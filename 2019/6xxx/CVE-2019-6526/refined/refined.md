Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-6526:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of encryption for sensitive data transmitted by the affected devices. Specifically, the devices use plaintext transmission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data (CWE-311): Sensitive data, such as administrative passwords, is transmitted in plaintext.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can capture sensitive data, such as administrative passwords.
- This captured data can be used for further malicious activities, such as unauthorized access and control over the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network sniffing/eavesdropping: An attacker intercepts network traffic to capture the plaintext sensitive data being transmitted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path to intercept communications between the device and other network entities.
- No authentication is required; an attacker can passively capture the data in transit.

**CVSS v3 Base Score:** 9.8
**CVSS Vector:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
