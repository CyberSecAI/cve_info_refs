The provided content relates to CVE-2019-6257.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the `get_remote_contents()` function of the elFinder file manager. This function fetches remote content based on a provided URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The `get_remote_contents()` function lacked sufficient validation and sanitization of the provided URL. Specifically, it failed to properly block requests to internal or private network addresses, allowing an attacker to potentially bypass network security controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks. This includes:
- Scanning internal network ports and services that are not exposed to the public internet.
- Reading or interacting with internal services or resources.
- Potentially leveraging internal systems to further compromise the network.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `get_remote_contents()` function, specifically by providing a crafted URL when fetching remote resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to control the URL passed to the `get_remote_contents()` function, which typically occurs during file upload operations from a URL. The attacker also needs access to the elFinder instance.

**Details from the provided diff:**
The commit addresses the vulnerability by adding additional checks to the URL being processed by `get_remote_contents()`. These checks include:

- Disallowing IPv6 addresses.
- Disallowing URLs without a dot in the host part.
- Disallowing including "localhost" or "localdomain".
- Checking for IPv4 local loopback, private network, and link-local addresses.

The commit also adds a new option `urlUploadFilter` to allow further filtering of URLs. This option, if enabled, calls a user-defined function to validate the requested URL.
