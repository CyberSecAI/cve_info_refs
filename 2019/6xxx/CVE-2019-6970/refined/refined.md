{
  "CVE-2019-6970": {
    "status": "relevant",
    "details": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The \"edit_blog.php\" script in Moodle CMS allows a registered user to add external RSS feed resources. This feature can be abused to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SSRF vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied URLs.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to target internal networks or internet-hosted servers, potentially bypassing firewall rules and IP filtering. Additionally, the attacker could perform GET requests with parameters, which could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if an exploitable vulnerability is present on the targeted server.",
       "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this via a malicious URL/TCP port in the external RSS feed resource settings.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a registered user on the Moodle platform to add external RSS feed resources. No special privileges or advanced knowledge are explicitly required"
