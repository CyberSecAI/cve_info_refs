- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is related to the potential for an attacker to obtain a TLS session key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is categorized as "Cryptographic Issues" (CWE-310).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to decrypt TLS traffic between a legitimate user and the device, potentially compromising the confidentiality of the communication.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have access to the web interface of the affected device and the ability to observe TLS traffic between legitimate users and the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the device and the ability to passively monitor or capture TLS traffic between the device and legitimate users. The attacker does not require any system privileges or user interaction to achieve this.
