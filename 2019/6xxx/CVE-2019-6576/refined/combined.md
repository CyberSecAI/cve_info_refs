WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the web interface of the affected devices

• Restrict access to port 161/udp to trusted devices

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and
monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and
monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC HMI Panels are used for operator control and monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) is an engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC Panels,
SIMATIC Industrial PCs, and Standard PCs running WinCC Runtime Advanced or SCADA System WinCC
Runtime Professional visualization software.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6572

The affected device offered SNMP read and write capacities with a publicly know hardcoded community
string.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected device.
Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use
the vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality and integrity of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6576

An attacker with network access to affected devices could potentially obtain a TLS session key. If the
attacker is able to observe TLS trafﬁc between a legitimate user and the device, then the attacker
could decrypt the TLS trafﬁc.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the web
interface of the device and who is able to observe TLS trafﬁc between legitimate users and the web
interface of the affected device. The vulnerability could impact the conﬁdentiality of the communication
between the affected device and a legitimate user.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of the security vulnerability was known.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6577

The integrated web server could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if an attacker is able to
modify particular parts of the device conﬁguration via SNMP.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the affected system.
Successful exploitation requires system privileges and user interaction. An attacker could use the
vulnerability to compromise conﬁdentiality and the integrity of the affected system.

At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known.
