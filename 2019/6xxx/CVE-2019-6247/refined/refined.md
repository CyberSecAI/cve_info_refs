Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6247:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `agg::cell_aa::not_equal` function within the Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) library, which is used by svgpp. The function uses recursion based on the difference between x-coordinates (`dx = x2 - x1`). If this difference (`dx`) is greater or equal to a limit (`dx_limit = 16384 << poly_subpixel_shift`), the function calls itself recursively with new coordinates derived from the original ones.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core vulnerability is a stack overflow. The recursive calls of `agg::cell_aa::not_equal` lack proper termination condition, leading to an unbounded recursion. When `(x2 - x1)` remains greater than the `dx_limit` during the recursive calls, it can lead to a stack overflow due to excessive stack usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A stack overflow can lead to a denial of service. It might also be possible to overwrite return addresses and achieve arbitrary code execution. The provided description suggests this as a potential consequence.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can craft a malicious SVG file that, when parsed by `svgpp`, triggers the vulnerable code path in the AGG library, causing a stack overflow. Specifically, the SVG file should contain elements that cause the  `agg::cell_aa::not_equal`  function to be called with parameters that will lead to infinite recursion.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious SVG file to an application that uses the vulnerable `svgpp` library with the AGG component. This could be through a web interface, file upload, or any other mechanism where SVG files are processed using this library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information clarifies that svgpp is a header-only library, making the vulnerability transitive. The issue exists in the AGG library, which svgpp includes.
- The provided content includes additional vulnerabilities beyond the scope of CVE-2019-6247. These are CVE-2019-6245 (also related to AGG), CVE-2021-44960 (svgpp specific), and two other bugs that are not associated with a CVE ID.
