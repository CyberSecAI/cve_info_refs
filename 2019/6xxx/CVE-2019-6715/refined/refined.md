Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6715:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `pub/sns.php` file of the W3 Total Cache plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin improperly handles the `SubscribeURL` field within the `SubscriptionConfirmation` JSON data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Arbitrary file read:** The plugin allows a remote attacker to specify a `file://` URI in the `SubscribeURL` field. This bypasses intended input validation and allows the attacker to read any file accessible to the webserver.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server, potentially exposing configuration files, database credentials, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP PUT request:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP PUT request to the vulnerable `pub/sns.php` endpoint.
*   **JSON payload:** The request includes a JSON payload with the `Type` set to `SubscriptionConfirmation` and a crafted `SubscribeURL` field that uses the `file://` scheme followed by the path of the desired file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be located anywhere with network access to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   **No authentication required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any prior authentication.
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the path to the vulnerable `pub/sns.php` file (`/wp-content/plugins/w3-total-cache/pub/sns.php`).
* **Ability to send HTTP PUT requests:** The attacker must be capable of crafting and sending HTTP PUT requests.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects W3 Total Cache plugin versions between 0.9.2.6 and 0.9.3, and was fixed in version 0.9.4.
