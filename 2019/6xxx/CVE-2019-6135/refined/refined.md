**CVE-2019-6135 Analysis**

The provided content describes multiple memory leaks within the `libiec61850` library. Although a CVE is not mentioned, the information aligns with a potential memory leak vulnerability that could be assigned a CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the memory leaks is the improper handling of memory allocation and deallocation within the `libiec61850` library. Specifically, the issues stem from:
   - Failing to free allocated memory for `MmsValue` structures (strings, structures, integers, etc.) in `mms_value.c` and `goose_publisher_example.c`.
   - Failing to free allocated memory in `mms_mapping.c` during the creation of the MMS data model when using `GLOBAL_MALLOC` and `GLOBAL_CALLOC`.
   - Leaks within `LIBIEC61850_SV_createSVControlBlocks` during creation of SV control blocks related structures.
   - Usage of `StringUtils_copyString` where copied strings are not deallocated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Memory Leaks:** The code allocates memory using `GLOBAL_MALLOC`, `GLOBAL_CALLOC`, and `StringUtils_copyString` but fails to release it in various code paths. This leads to a gradual consumption of memory over time.
   - **Unfreed Structures:** The memory allocated for various data structures within `MmsValue` and `mms_mapping` is not released after use, resulting in memory leaks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is a denial-of-service condition. Over time, the accumulation of memory leaks can lead to excessive memory consumption, causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
   - **Resource Exhaustion:** The continuous allocation of memory without deallocation can exhaust available system resources. This will likely affect other processes running in the same system.

**Attack Vectors:**

   - **Normal Operation:** The memory leaks manifest during the normal operation of the library, particularly during the creation of the MMS data model or handling of GOOSE messages in the examples. An attacker does not need to be in an adjacent or privileged position in the network, the problem is inherent in the library code.
   - **Prolonged Usage:** An attacker could exacerbate the issue by simply using the library for an extended period, triggering more memory allocations.
   - **Specific Function Calls:** By making use of the specific functions with memory leaks, an attacker could more rapidly exhaust the available memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - No special privileges or access is required. The memory leak occurs during normal library usage.
   - No network access is needed for local exploitation. Remote exploitation could be achieved by an attacker able to influence server behavior using a protocol implemented by the vulnerable library.
   - The attacker only needs to use the library in a way that triggers the vulnerable code paths or prolong the execution of the affected code (e.g., create connections, send and receive messages using the GOOSE publisher).

**Additional Notes:**

   - The provided issue reports contain detailed call stacks showing the exact locations of the memory leaks and can help with the development of patches to fix the issue.
   - The analysis shows the `Memory_malloc` and `Memory_calloc` functions as the root allocation routines, which are used in the custom memory management implementation in the `libiec61850` project, suggesting the library might not be using the standard `malloc` and `calloc`.

In summary, the content reveals a critical memory leak issue within `libiec61850`. This can cause a DoS due to memory exhaustion under normal use. No special attacker capabilities or position is required as it is a vulnerability present in the code itself.
