The provided content relates to CVE-2019-6992.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-supplied data within the `controlcaps.php` view of ZoneMinder. Specifically, the `Protocol` field is displayed without adequate filtration, which allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application stores the attacker's malicious payload into the database and reflects it back to the victim when the page is loaded.
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
- Session hijacking
- Stealing user credentials
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Defacing the web page
- Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have privileges to modify the "Name" and "Protocol" fields via a web interface
- A malicious payload is injected into the `Protocol` field when creating or editing a control.
- When the `controlcaps` view is accessed, the injected JavaScript payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to modify control settings or have the ability to inject data into the application.
- The attacker does not need to be a system administrator; basic user privileges are sufficient for this specific vulnerability.
