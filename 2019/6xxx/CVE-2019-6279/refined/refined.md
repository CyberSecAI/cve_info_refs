Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **Incorrect Access Control** vulnerability within the web interface of the ChinaMobile PLC Wireless Router GPN2.4P21-C-CN. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how the router handles requests to the `cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html` with the subpage `wlsecurity`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is that the router does not properly authenticate or authorize requests to change the wireless security password via the specified URI. This allows unauthenticated users to change the WPA/WPA2 key without logging in.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Password Change:** An attacker can change the wireless security password (WPA/WPA2 key) of the router.
*   **Denial of Service:** By changing the password, the attacker can effectively deny legitimate users access to the wireless network.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** An attacker controlling the wireless network can perform further malicious activities (e.g., man-in-the-middle attacks).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Web Page:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTML page that sends a specially crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. This HTML page contains the necessary parameters to change the Wi-Fi password.
*   **Social Engineering or Access Point Proximity:** The attacker can trick victims into visiting this page using social engineering. Alternatively, any attacker connected to the same Access Point as the victim can trigger this exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network (either wired or wireless) as the vulnerable router, or be able to induce a victim on the same network to visit a malicious webpage.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URI (`cgi-bin/webproc?getpage=html/index.html` with subpage `wlsecurity`).
*   **Ability to Craft HTML:** The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious HTML page with the correct parameters to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary of Exploit Steps:**
    1. Create a malicious HTML page that makes a POST request to the router's vulnerable endpoint with necessary parameters for changing the Wi-Fi password.
    2. Lure a victim on the same network to visit the malicious HTML page or have the attacker trigger it directly.
    3. The router processes the malicious request, allowing the attacker to change the wireless password without prior authentication.
