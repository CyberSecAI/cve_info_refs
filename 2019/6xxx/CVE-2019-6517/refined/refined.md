- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized administrative level privileges on the workstation, leading to arbitrary command execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the affected BD FACSLyric systems. The advisory explicitly states the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
