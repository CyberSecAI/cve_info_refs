        }
      }
    ],
    "summary": "The vulnerability is present in the exportValues method within an AcroForm in Foxit Reader. It occurs because the application does not validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it, potentially leading to a Use-After-Free condition. This can be exploited by an attacker by enticing a user to open a malicious PDF or visit a malicious web page, allowing for arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process."
