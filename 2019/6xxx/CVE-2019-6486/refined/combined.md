| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1123013#c0)  Karol Babioch   2019-01-24 10:16:36 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-6486  ---  This DoS vulnerability in the crypto/elliptic implementations of the P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves may let an attacker craft inputs that consume excessive amounts of CPU.  These inputs might be delivered via TLS handshakes, X.509 certificates, JWT tokens, ECDH shares or ECDSA signatures. In some cases, if an ECDH private key is reused more than once, the attack can also lead to key recovery.  The issue is CVE-2019-6486 and Go issue golang.org/issue/29903. See the Go issue for more details.  ---  References: <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-6486> <https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!topic/golang-announce/mVeX35iXuSw> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1123013#c2)  Jordi Massaguer   2019-01-29 11:57:07 UTC  ``` Assigning to containers team so the bug squad leader can plan for this one. @Florian, is there anything we need to do to have this in our backlog? ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1123013#c4)  Karol Babioch   2019-01-30 11:03:02 UTC  ``` Scanning Factory for packages that import this Go packages, yielded the following result:  caasp-dex is importing crypto/elliptic chartmuseum is importing crypto/elliptic coredns is importing crypto/elliptic dex-oidc is importing crypto/elliptic etcd is importing crypto/elliptic golang-org-x-crypto is importing crypto/elliptic heapster is importing crypto/elliptic helm is importing crypto/elliptic kbfs is importing crypto/elliptic kubernetes-dashboard is importing crypto/elliptic kubernetes is importing crypto/elliptic kured is importing crypto/elliptic sonobuoy is importing crypto/elliptic syncthing is importing crypto/elliptic  We should at least fix/rebuild those packages that are also used in our SLE products. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1123013#c5)  Flavio Castelli   2019-01-30 11:29:13 UTC  ``` Adding Jeff to CC, he's the maintainer of Go at SUSE.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c0)  Aleksa Sarai   2018-10-31 15:38:30 UTC  ``` Within OBS, if you have more than one option of a package to use for a build, the build will be considered unresolveable. In this case, the problem is that both "go1.11" and "go" provide "golang(API) = 1.11". We should avoid having the API provides in "go" -- since the point of the API provides is to allow for version pinning (and "go" is always the latest so it doesn't make sense to use it for pinning). ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c1)  Jeff Kowalczyk   2018-11-05 04:52:02 UTC  ``` Thanks for this Aleksa, accepted associated OBS request  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/645772>, factory request <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/646282> is in review.  Can you provide a syntax example of declaring dependency on a specific version of golang(API)? We are seeing the issue now with the upstream release versions of some packages having soft (gofmt) or hard (GoPkg.lock -> go.mod) dependency on go1.10 or go1.11.  Use of golang(API) is not mentioned in [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Go](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3APackaging_Go), and I'll document the example there. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c3)  Jeff Kowalczyk   2018-11-05 23:55:15 UTC  ``` What sequence of events will happen before OBS builds of the updated go metapackage start clearing the 'unresolvable' error?  Does each affected SUSE/openSUSE distribution make and accept request(s) to update a package in preparation for a release milestone, then when the next full release lands (date TBD) OBS updates its repositories?  Or, do the distributions have configured repositories of in-development packages that will be seen by OBS during builds? ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c5)  Aleksa Sarai   2018-11-08 01:59:43 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeff Kowalczyk from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c3)) > What sequence of events will happen before OBS builds of the updated go > metapackage start clearing the 'unresolvable' error? >  > Does each affected SUSE/openSUSE distribution make and accept > request(s) to update a package in preparation for a release milestone, then > when the next full release lands (date TBD) OBS updates its repositories? >  > Or, do the distributions have configured repositories of in-development > packages that will be seen by OBS during builds?  For the main distributions, they'd need to be accepted everywhere. However, practically speaking, by submitting to Factory and SLE it will get auto-forwarded to Leap (in most cases -- @Jordi, is this true of the Go packages?).  But individual projects can add the repository to OBS so that it's built on top of devel:languages:go -- this is what we do for Virtualization:containers (from memory).  But I've already included the devel:languages:go change into SLE, because we needed it for Docker (we should probably have a discussion over how the hand-off to you for maintaining Go within SLE should work -- historically the container team has done this). ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c6)  Aleksa Sarai   2018-11-08 02:05:03 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeff Kowalczyk from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c1)) > Can you provide a syntax example of declaring dependency on a specific > version of golang(API)? We are seeing the issue now with the upstream > release versions of some packages having soft (gofmt) or hard (GoPkg.lock -> > go.mod) dependency on go1.10 or go1.11.  Basically, you would do:    BuildRequires: golang(API) = 1.10 % hard  or    BuildRequires: golang(API) >= 1.9 % soft  Historically this was actually a not-very-good decision, but now that we have actually designed the packaging around pinning the "API" version it makes more sense.  The problem is that having golang(API) provided by both go and go1.10 causes OBS to get confused (depending on what repos its using, the prjconf  and so on).  > Use of golang(API) is not mentioned in > [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Packaging_Go](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3APackaging_Go), > and I'll document the example there.  Yeah that needs to be rewritten basically, though I would really like us to first have a discussion on how golang-packaging should be reworked to actually be useful. There was a bug about this opened recently -- let me see if I can find the bug number. ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1114209#c7)  Dominique Leuenberger   2018-11-13 09:03:53 UTC  ``` imho, that change done to the 'go' package was bogus:  Wed Oct 31 15:35:57 UTC 2018 - Aleksa Sarai <asarai@suse.com>  - Remove golang(API) provides, since the go<ver> packages now provide this and   providing it here causes issues when building under SLE12 (not to mention   being confusing -- since golang(API) is used to pin versions).

I was aware of the Prefer trick, but it's not clear to me how well it works when you have a project that has a Prefer but is then copypac'd, submit-requested, maintainence-requested, copypac'd between OBS and IBS, etc. Does Prefer really stick like this -- because it was my understanding that you define it in a project and not in a package. Does it stick to the package sufficiently, or will we have to deal with build failures all over the place while we figure out which projects use Go packages and don't have Prefer?  As for the >= comment -- a large number of BuildRequires are not for >=, they use BuildRequires: golang(API) = 1.x (which is what Docker has right now -- and the original idea behind having golang(API) was version pinning IIRC).  But also, as far as I can tell, my packages that use >= aren't broken by the change (umoci has >=1.6 and it's building okay as far as I can tell). You no longer get the package "go" when you build -- but that would just pull the latest-version package anyway.  The problem that this change fixed was that BuildRequires: golang(API) = 1.10 would resolve to 2 different packages if the go package happened to be the same version, and would thus require setting Prefer in every project that contains a go-built package. If you really need "go" you can BuildRequires: go...  > Since you now again dropped the golang(API) provides, this has now again > been broken (see for example > [https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE:Factory/verilator](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/openSUSE%3AFactory/verilator) which > build just fine before breaking it  I'm confused -- the unresolvable error is for "perl-SystemPerl-devel"?

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Description

![@julieqiu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5943521?u=b7766f1296014718a62fed3c8b2017587e51bd5e&v=4&size=48)[julieqiu](https://github.com/julieqiu)opened [on Jan 23, 2019](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/29903#issue-402444291)

A DoS vulnerability in the crypto/elliptic implementations of the P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves may let an attacker craft inputs that consume excessive amounts of CPU.

These inputs might be delivered via TLS handshakes, X.509 certificates, JWT tokens, ECDH shares or ECDSA signatures. In some cases, if an ECDH private key is reused more than once, the attack can also lead to key recovery.

This issue is [CVE-2019-6486](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vj2x-6gjj-jvh2 "CVE-2019-6486"). It was found and reported by [the Wycheproof project](https://github.com/google/wycheproof).

# Project Wycheproof

<https://github.com/c2sp/wycheproof>

*Project Wycheproof is named after
[Mount Wycheproof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wycheproof), the smallest
mountain in the world. The main motivation for the project is to have a goal
that is achievable. The smaller the mountain the more likely it is to be able to
climb it.*

Note

Hello RWC 2024 attendees and others! Wycheproof recently moved to community
maintenance thanks to the shared efforts of Google and C2SP.
We are still working to update the README and documentation,
but we welcome your feedback and look forward to your contributions!

## Introduction

Project Wycheproof tests crypto libraries against known attacks.

Unfortunately, in cryptography, subtle mistakes can have catastrophic
consequences, and we found that libraries fall into such implementation
pitfalls much too often and for much too long. Good implementation guidelines,
however, are hard to come by: understanding how to implement cryptography
securely requires digesting decades' worth of academic literature. We recognize
that software engineers fix and prevent bugs with unit testing, and we found
that cryptographic loopholes can be resolved by the same means.

These observations have prompted us to develop Project Wycheproof, a collection
of unit tests that detect known weaknesses or check for expected behaviors of
some cryptographic algorithm. Project Wycheproof provides tests for most
cryptographic algorithms, including RSA, elliptic curve crypto and
authenticated encryption. Our cryptographers have systematically surveyed the
literature and implemented most known attacks. We have over 80 test cases which
have uncovered more than [40 bugs](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc/bugs.md). For
example, we found that we could recover the private key of widely-used DSA and
ECDHC implementations.

While we are committed to develop as many attacks as possible, Project
Wycheproof is by no means complete. Passing the tests does not imply that the
library is secure, it just means that it is not vulnerable to the attacks that
Project Wycheproof tests for. Cryptographers are also constantly discovering
new attacks. Nevertheless, with Project Wycheproof developers and users now can
check their libraries against a large number of known attacks, without having
to spend years reading academic papers or become cryptographers themselves.

For more information on the goals and strategies of Project Wycheproof, please
check out our [documentation](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc).

### Coverage

Project Wycheproof has tests for the most popular crypto algorithms, including

* AES-EAX
* AES-GCM
* ChaCha20-Poly1305
* [DH](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc/dh.md)
* DHIES
* [DSA](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc/dsa.md)
* [ECDH](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc/ecdh.md)
* ECDSA
* EdDSA
* ECIES
* HKDF
* HMAC
* [RSA](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc/rsa.md)
* X25519, X448

The tests detect whether a library is vulnerable to many attacks, including

* Invalid curve attacks
* Biased nonces in digital signature schemes
* Of course, all Bleichenbacher’s attacks
* And many more -- we have over 80 test cases

Our first set of tests are written in Java, because Java has a common
cryptographic interface. This allowed us to test multiple providers with a
single test suite. While this interface is somewhat low level, and should not
be used directly, we still apply a "defense in depth" argument and expect that
the implementations are as robust as possible. For example, we consider weak
default values to be a significant security flaw. We are converting as many
tests into sets of test vectors to simplify porting the tests to other
languages. We provide ready-to-use test runners for Java Cryptography
Architecture providers such as [Bouncy Castle](http://bouncycastle.org),
[Spongy Castle](https://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/), the
[Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider)
and the default
providers in [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/).

### Usage

#### Setup

* Install [Bazel](https://bazel.build/).
* Install [Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction
  Policy Files](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6481627/java-security-illegal-key-size-or-default-parameters). This enables tests with large key
  sizes. Otherwise you'll see a lot of "illegal key size" exceptions.
* Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/google/wycheproof.git

```

#### Execute tests

* To test latest stable version of Bouncy Castle:

```
bazel test BouncyCastleAllTests

```

* To test other versions, e.g., v1.52:

```
bazel test BouncyCastleAllTests_1_52

```

* To test all known versions (warning, will take a long time):

```
bazel test BouncyCastleAllTests_*

```

* To test a local jar, set the `WYCHEPROOF_BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR` environment
  variable:

```
$ WYCHEPROOF_BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR=/path/to/bouncycastle
$ bazel test BouncyCastleTestLocal
$ bazel test BouncyCastleAllTestsLocal
```

Note: Bazel does not currently invalidate the build on environment changes. If
you change the `WYCHEPROOF_BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR` environment variable, run `bazel clean` to force a rebuild:

```
$ WYCHEPROOF_BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR=/path/to/bouncycastle
$ bazel test BouncyCastleTestLocal
$ WYCHEPROOF_BOUNCYCASTLE_JAR=/path/to/other/jar
$ bazel clean
$ bazel test BouncyCastleTestLocal
```

* To test [Spongy Castle](https://rtyley.github.io/spongycastle/), replace
  `BouncyCastle` with `SpongyCastle` in your commands, for example:

```
bazel test SpongyCastleAllTests

```

* To test the [Amazon Corretto Crypto
  Provider](https://github.com/corretto/amazon-corretto-crypto-provider),
  replace `BouncyCastle` with `Accp` in your commands, for example:

```
bazel test AccpAllTests

```

* To test a local jar for the Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider, set the
  `WYCHEPROOF_ACCP_JAR` environment variable:

```
$ WYCHEPROOF_ACCP_JAR=/path/to/accp
$ bazel test AccpTestLocal
$ bazel test AccpAllTestsLocal
```

Note: bazel does not currently invalidate the build on environment changes. If
you change the `WYCHEPROOF_ACCP_JAR` environment variable, run `bazel clean` to force a rebuild:

```
$ WYCHEPROOF_ACCP_JAR=/path/to/accp
$ bazel test AccpTestLocal
$ WYCHEPROOF_ACCP_JAR=/path/to/other/jar
$ bazel clean
$ bazel test AccpTestLocal
```

* To test your current installation of [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/):

```
bazel test OpenJDKAllTests

```

Note that OpenJDKAllTests expects that OpenJDK is your default JDK, so it might
refuse to run or its results might be incorrect if you are using some other JDK.
If you downloaded your JDK from Oracle or <https://java.com>, you're probably
using Oracle JDK, which should be compatible with OpenJDK, thus the tests should
run correctly.

Some tests take a very long time to finish. If you want to exclude them, use
`BouncyCastleTest`, `SpongyCastleTest` or `OpenJDKTest` -- these targets exclude
all slow tests (which are annotated with `@SlowTest`).

Most test targets are failing, and each failure might be a security issue. To
learn more about what a failed test means, you might want to check out [our
documentation](/C2SP/wycheproof/blob/master/doc/bugs.md) or the comments on top of the corresponding test
function and test class.

### Hall of Bugs

Here are some of the notable vulnerabilities that are uncovered by
Project Wycheproof:

* OpenJDK's SHA1withDSA leaks private keys > 1024 bits

  + Test: testBiasSha1WithDSA in [DsaTest](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/java/com/google/security/wycheproof/testcases/DsaTest.java).
  + This bug is the same as [CVE-2003-0971](https://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2003-0971) ("GnuPG generated
    ElGamal signatures that leaked the private key").
* Bouncy Castle's ECDHC leaks private keys

  + Test: testModifiedPublic and testWrongOrderEcdhc in
    [EcdhTest](https://github.com/google/wycheproof/blob/master/java/com/google/security/wycheproof/testcases/EcdhTest.java).

The release is still in progress, but we are moving it to Thursday, December 13 at approximately 8 pm UTC. You can see an updated pre-announcement at <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-announce/D4sE5tGvhe8/sVJSIEtFCAAJ>.  I will send a follow-up email when the release is complete and the embargo on the details of the security descriptions is lifted.

Package        : golang-1.7
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-7187 CVE-2019-6486

A vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the P-521 and
P-384 elliptic curves, which could result in denial of service and in
some cases key recovery.

In addition this update fixes a vulnerability in "go get", which could
result in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.4-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.7>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

The release is still in progress, but we are moving it to Thursday, December 13 at approximately 8 pm UTC. You can see an updated pre-announcement at <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-announce/D4sE5tGvhe8/sVJSIEtFCAAJ>.  I will send a follow-up email when the release is complete and the embargo on the details of the security descriptions is lifted.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVE-2019-5736

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-5721.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-5737.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-5736 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5736)

#### Description

runc through 1.0-rc6, as used in Docker before 18.09.2 and other products, allows attackers to overwrite the host runc binary (and consequently obtain host root access) by leveraging the ability to execute a command as root within one of these types of containers: (1) a new container with an attacker-controlled image, or (2) an existing container, to which the attacker previously had write access, that can be attached with docker exec. This occurs because of file-descriptor mishandling, related to /proc/self/exe.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-4380-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : golang-1.8
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-6574 CVE-2018-7187 CVE-2019-6486

A vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the P-521 and
P-384 elliptic curves, which could result in denial of service and in
some cases key recovery.

In addition this update fixes two vulnerabilities in "go get", which
could result in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.8 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.8 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.8>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

…term to prevent long busy loop

If beta8 is unusually large, the addition loop might take a very long
time to bring x3-beta8 back positive.

This would lead to a DoS vulnerability in the implementation of the
P-521 and P-384 elliptic curves that may let an attacker craft inputs
to ScalarMult that consume excessive amounts of CPU.

This fixes [CVE-2019-6486](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vj2x-6gjj-jvh2 "CVE-2019-6486").
