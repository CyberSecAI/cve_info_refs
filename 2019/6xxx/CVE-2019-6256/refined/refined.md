Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6256:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when handling RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling. Specifically, the issue occurs during error handling when processing a sequence of HTTP GET and POST requests within the same TCP session, where both requests share an identical `x-sessioncookie` value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Invalid Function Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is an invalid function pointer dereference. This occurs within the `readSocket` function (likely in `GroupsockHepler.cpp`), where an error in handling the sequence of HTTP requests leads to dereferencing a corrupted or attacker-controlled function pointer.
*   **RTSP-over-HTTP Tunneling:** The vulnerability is specific to setups where RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling is enabled.
*  **Improper Session Handling:** The server incorrectly handles or reuses session data when processing the two HTTP requests with the same `x-sessioncookie`, leading to the invalid function pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. Triggering the invalid function pointer dereference leads to a server crash, rendering the service unavailable.
*  **Potential Remote Code Execution:** The provided GitHub issue mentions a "potential remote command execution" in version 0.93. This suggests the possibility that under certain circumstances, an attacker could potentially control the corrupted function pointer to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack is network-based, requiring the attacker to send specially crafted HTTP GET and POST requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **RTSP-over-HTTP:** The attack requires that the server has RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **RTSP-over-HTTP Tunneling Awareness:** The attacker needs to know if the target server is using RTSP-over-HTTP tunneling.
*   **Ability to send HTTP GET/POST requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send custom HTTP requests, which could be achieved by using tools such as `curl` or `netcat`, or by programming an attack script.

**Additional Details**

*   The issue was reported to affect versions up to at least 0.93 of LIVE555 Media Server, with claims of impact on earlier versions though this was not verified.
*   The exploit is triggered by sending a GET request with a specific `x-sessioncookie` header, immediately followed by a POST request using the same `x-sessioncookie` in the same TCP session.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) Python script is provided in the GitHub issue report which demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
