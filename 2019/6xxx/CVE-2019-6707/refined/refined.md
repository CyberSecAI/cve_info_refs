The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in PHPSHE CMS system V1.7.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `_dowhere` function in `product.php`, which is used to construct SQL queries. The function improperly handles user-supplied `product_id` and `product_order` parameters, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability through the `product_id` and `product_order` parameters.
- The `_dowhere` function concatenates user-supplied data directly into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
- Vulnerable parameters are processed via POST request.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to:
    - Data exfiltration
    - Data manipulation or deletion
    - Complete database takeover
    - Privilege escalation by adding/modifying administrative users
- The provided example shows an attacker is able to obtain the current database user by using a time based blind sql injection.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted POST request to the `/admin.php` endpoint with specific parameters that are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when updating product state via `admin.php?mod=product&act=state&state=1`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server running the vulnerable PHPSHE CMS instance.
- The attacker should be authenticated as an administrator or have access to the vulnerable endpoint since it is within admin panel.
