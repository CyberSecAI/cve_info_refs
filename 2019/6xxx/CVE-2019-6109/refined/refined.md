Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2019-6109**

*   **Root Cause:** Missing character encoding in the progress display of the `scp` client, specifically within the `refresh_progress_meter()` function in `progressmeter.c`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Improper handling of object names, allowing for manipulation of the client output through the use of ANSI control codes.
*   **Impact:** A malicious server or man-in-the-middle attacker can manipulate the `scp` client output, potentially hiding additional files being transferred, or spoofing output.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious or compromised server, or a man-in-the-middle attacker.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to control the SSH server the client connects to or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the connection, and needs to be able to provide specially crafted object names. User interaction is required because the client has to initiate the `scp` connection.

**CVE-2019-6110**

*   **Root Cause:** The `scp` client accepts and displays arbitrary stderr output from the server.
*   **Weaknesses:** The client does not properly sanitize stderr output from the server.
*  **Impact:** A malicious server or man-in-the-middle attacker can manipulate the client output, for example by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious or compromised server, or a man-in-the-middle attacker.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to control the SSH server the client connects to, or perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the connection.

**CVE-2019-6111**

*   **Root Cause:** The `scp` client does not sufficiently validate object names received from the server, since it's derived from the old `rcp` implementation. It only checks for directory traversal attacks.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient validation of object names received from the server, allowing for arbitrary file overwrites.
*   **Impact:** A malicious or compromised `scp` server, or a man-in-the-middle attacker, can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory, including sensitive files like `.ssh/authorized_keys`.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious or compromised server, or a man-in-the-middle attacker.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to control the SSH server the client connects to or perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and needs to be able to return crafted object names. Exploitation can be simplified if the recursive operation (-r) is used in the client's scp command.

**CVE-2018-20685**
*   **Root Cause:** Missing checks of filename in `scp.c` of the `scp` client.
*   **Weaknesses:**  The `scp` client allows remote SSH servers to bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename.
*   **Impact:** The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A malicious or compromised server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to control the SSH server the client connects to, and needs to be able to send filenames of . or an empty filename.

It's worth noting that the provided content also includes information on fixes and affected products from various vendors such as SUSE, Ubuntu, Red Hat, and Gentoo, along with links to their respective bug trackers and security advisories. OpenBSD's commit logs are also provided, offering a granular view of the code changes related to these vulnerabilities. Also included are other CVEs which have fixes related to these openssh flaws, specifically:
* CVE-2018-20684 - WinSCP vulnerability
* Several CVEs related to OpenSSL and other components affected by fixes for CVE-2019-6111.

The content from `sintonen.fi` also provides a good overview of the `scp` client vulnerabilities and a potential mitigation, by using sftp instead of scp.

The content also indicates that for CVE-2019-6110, upstream does not consider it a vulnerability and there is no fix for this in Ubuntu stable releases.

In summary, the core issue stems from the `scp` client's historical design, which trusts the server too much in the file transfer process. This lack of client-side validation and sanitization opens the door to various attacks, including arbitrary file overwrites and client output manipulation.
