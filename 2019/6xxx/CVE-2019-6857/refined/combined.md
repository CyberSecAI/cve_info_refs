Schneider Electric strongly recommends following industry cybersecurity best practices such as:

* Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* Physical controls should be in place so that no unauthorized person would have access to the ICS and safety controllers, peripheral equipment, or the ICS and safety networks.
* All controllers should reside in locked cabinets and never be left in the “Program” mode.
* All programming software should be kept in locked cabinets and should never be connected to any network other than the network for which the devices are intended.
* All methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network, such as CDs, USB drives, etc., should be scanned before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
* Laptops that have connected to any other network besides the intended network should never be allowed to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are not accessible from the Internet.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

For more information on this vulnerability and the associated upgrade, please see [Schneider Electric’s SEVD-2019-344-01](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/download/document/SEVD-2019-344-01/)

For more details and assistance on how to protect during installation, please contact a [Schneider Electric representative](http://www2.schneider-electric.com/sites/corporate/en/support/cybersecurity/cybersecurity.page) and/or [Schneider Electric Industrial Cybersecurity Services](https://www.schneider-electric.com/en/work/services/field-services/industrial-automation/industrial-cybersecurity/industrial-cybersecurity.jsp). These organizations are aware of this situation and can support you through the process.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
