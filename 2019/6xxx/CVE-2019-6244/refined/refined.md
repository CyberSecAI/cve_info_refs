The provided content is related to CVE-2019-6244.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of CSRF protection in `a_sqlbackx.php`, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries by tricking an authenticated admin user into submitting a crafted form.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The `a_sqlbackx.php` script lacks CSRF protection, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Arbitrary SQL Injection:** Although not a direct SQL injection vulnerability, the lack of CSRF protection enables attackers to inject and execute arbitrary SQL queries through the vulnerable `a_sqlbackx.php` script

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server by inserting malicious PHP code into the database via SQL queries and then exporting the injected code to a PHP file in the web server's root directory, leading to a webshell.
*   **Complete system compromise**: By gaining a shell, the attacker could take full control over the target system.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted by a logged-in admin, executes arbitrary SQL queries on the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage, which triggers the crafted CSRF requests.
* The attacker also needs MySQL operation rights.
