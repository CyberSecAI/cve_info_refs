{
  "CVE-2019-6133": {
    "Description": "In PolicyKit (aka polkit) 0.115, the \"start time\" protection mechanism can be bypassed because fork() is not atomic, and therefore authorization decisions are improperly cached. This is related to lack of uid checking in polkitbackend/polkitbackendinteractiveauthority.c.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from PolicyKit's improper reliance on the fork() system call being atomic. Specifically, the authorization cache mechanism used by PolicyKit was vulnerable to a race condition due to the non-atomic nature of fork().",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Non-atomic fork() operation",
      "Improper caching of authorization decisions",
      "Lack of uid checking for temporary authorizations",
       "PID reuse"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain access to services that have cached authorizations, potentially escalating their privileges by impersonating an authorized process.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Exploiting non-atomic fork() race condition",
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "Ability to execute code locally",
       "Ability to create processes with the same start time and process ID as an older authenticated process."

    ],
        "Affected Products":[
      "Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7",
        "Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04, 16.04, 18.04 and 18.10",
