- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Frog CMS forgot password page does not properly sanitize user-supplied input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, a reflected XSS vulnerability is present in the forgot password functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirecting the user to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious link containing the XSS payload. When a victim clicks the link, the payload is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing the malicious payload and trick a user into accessing the malicious link. The attacker is not required to have any prior access to the system.
