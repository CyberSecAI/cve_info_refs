Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6566:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Improper Access Controls: A non-administrative user can replace the uninstaller with a malicious version.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control, allowing a non-privileged user to overwrite the uninstaller component.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker who successfully replaces the uninstaller with a malicious version can gain administrator privileges on the system when the uninstaller is executed. This can lead to full system compromise, including the ability to execute arbitrary code with system-level permissions, modify system configurations and steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have a non-administrative user account on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have a local, non-administrative user account on the system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to place their malicious uninstaller in the directory where the original uninstaller resides
*   The attacker must also trick the user to run the modified uninstaller
