**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A logic issue in the 802.1X implementation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is described as a logic error, specifically related to state management within the 802.1X protocol. This suggests an issue in how the system handles the different states of the 802.1X authentication process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
