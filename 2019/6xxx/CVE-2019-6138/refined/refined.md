Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is memory leaks within the `libiec61850` library, specifically in `mms_mapping.c` and `mms_value.c` files. The code allocates memory using `GLOBAL_MALLOC` and `GLOBAL_CALLOC` but does not free it in all cases, leading to memory leaks during runtime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unfreed memory allocations: Several functions allocate memory for various data structures but fail to free it when the allocated memory is no longer needed, leading to memory leaks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Memory exhaustion: Continued memory leaks can lead to a gradual increase in memory usage, which could eventually exhaust available memory and cause the application to crash or become unstable.
- Denial of service: In a long running server application, this memory leak could be exploited to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Triggering specific functions: The vulnerability is triggered by creating an `IedServer` object using a config file with data, that is then mapped to MMS.
- Normal usage: The leaks seem to be triggered during the normal usage of the library, so exploitation wouldn't necessarily require a specific attack vector beyond normal usage of the library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No special privileges are required, a normal user that uses the library is sufficient.
- Knowledge of the library's API and usage patterns is needed to trigger the vulnerable code paths.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content includes detailed stack traces and specific code snippets that demonstrate the memory leaks. The issue is identified by AddressSanitizer, which flags memory leaks. These stack traces are valuable for developers to quickly pinpoint the exact locations where memory leaks occur.
