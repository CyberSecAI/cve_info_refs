{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Memory leaks in `Ap4String.cpp` due to improper memory management when assigning strings.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leaks due to missing deallocations of dynamically allocated memory within `AP4_String::Assign`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Memory exhaustion leading to potential denial-of-service.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a crafted MP4 file using `mp42aac` or other tools that utilize the vulnerable `AP4_String` class.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted input file that triggers the memory leak. No specific position is needed."
