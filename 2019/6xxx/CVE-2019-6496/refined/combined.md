## Marvell Avastar wireless SoCs have multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#730261

Original Release Date: 2019-02-05 | Last Revised: 2019-04-19

---

### Overview

Some Marvell Avastar wireless system on chip (SoC) models have multiple vulnerabilities, including a block pool overflow during Wi-Fi network scan.

### Description

| A presentation at the ZeroNights 2018 conference [describes](https://2018.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/materials/19-Researching-Marvell-Avastar-Wi-Fi.pdf) multiple security issues with Marvell Avastar SoCs (models 88W8787, 88W8797, 88W8801, 88W8897, and 88W8997). The presentation provides some detail about a block pool memory overflow. During Wi-Fi network scans, an overflow condition can be triggered, overwriting certain block pool data structures. Because many devices conduct automatic background network scans, this vulnerability could be exploited regardless of whether the target is connected to a Wi-Fi network and without user interaction. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker within Wi-Fi radio range may be able to use a specially-crafted series of Wi-Fi frames execute arbitrary code on a system with a vulnerable Marvell SoC. Depending on implementation, the compromised SoC may then be used to intercept network traffic or achieve code execution on the host system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Marvell issued a [statement](https://www.scribd.com/document/398350818/WiFi-CVE-2019-6496-Marvell-s-Statement) and encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support. Microsoft issued an update to multiple Surface devices. See also the  Vendor Information section below. |
| --- |

| **Restrict physical access**An attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi radio range of the target to exploit the block pool overflow. Restricting access to the area around vulnerable devices may limit an attacker's ability to exploit this vulnerability.**Disable Wi-Fi**For systems that have other connectivity options like wired ethernet, it may be possible and practical to disable Wi-Fi. |

### [Marvell Semiconductor](#NALN-B84SXU) Affected

Notified:  January 04, 2019  Updated: March 18, 2019

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Marvell was made aware of a potential vulnerability (CVE-2019-6496), which was presented at the ZeroNights conference on November 21-22, 2018, with regard to our 88W8897 device. As Marvell places the highest priority on addressing security concerns, we immediately acted to understand the issue and implemented a fix.

In the presentation, detail was provided to manipulate the open-source Valve Steamlink platform to exploit a memory buffer overflow issue in the device firmware. Unlike this nonsecure
Valve Steamlink platform, the other systems mentioned in the presentation are all closed systems with high-level security protections in place such as DRM. As noted in the presenter’s blog, this would eliminate the ability for an individual to compromise the system
security:

“You may notice, that the majority of devices which use Marvell Wi-Fi are gaming devices, like PS 4 (maybe because of high-performance 802.11ac and Bluetooth COMBO). It’s difficult to research them because of the DRM protection.”

Marvell is not aware of any real world exploitation of this vulnerability outside of a controlled environment. Marvell deployed a fix to address this issue which we have made available in our standard driver and firmware. We have communicated to our direct customers to update to Marvell’s latest firmware and driver to get the most recent security enhancements, including support for WPA3.

Marvell encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support.

### Vendor Information

Marvell issued a [statement](https://www.scribd.com/document/398350818/WiFi-CVE-2019-6496-Marvell-s-Statement) and encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support.

## Marvell Avastar wireless SoCs have multiple vulnerabilities

#### Vulnerability Note VU#730261

Original Release Date: 2019-02-05 | Last Revised: 2019-04-19

---

### Overview

Some Marvell Avastar wireless system on chip (SoC) models have multiple vulnerabilities, including a block pool overflow during Wi-Fi network scan.

### Description

| A presentation at the ZeroNights 2018 conference [describes](https://2018.zeronights.ru/wp-content/uploads/materials/19-Researching-Marvell-Avastar-Wi-Fi.pdf) multiple security issues with Marvell Avastar SoCs (models 88W8787, 88W8797, 88W8801, 88W8897, and 88W8997). The presentation provides some detail about a block pool memory overflow. During Wi-Fi network scans, an overflow condition can be triggered, overwriting certain block pool data structures. Because many devices conduct automatic background network scans, this vulnerability could be exploited regardless of whether the target is connected to a Wi-Fi network and without user interaction. |
| --- |

### Impact

| An unauthenticated attacker within Wi-Fi radio range may be able to use a specially-crafted series of Wi-Fi frames execute arbitrary code on a system with a vulnerable Marvell SoC. Depending on implementation, the compromised SoC may then be used to intercept network traffic or achieve code execution on the host system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| Marvell issued a [statement](https://www.scribd.com/document/398350818/WiFi-CVE-2019-6496-Marvell-s-Statement) and encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support. Microsoft issued an update to multiple Surface devices. See also the  Vendor Information section below. |
| --- |

| **Restrict physical access**An attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi radio range of the target to exploit the block pool overflow. Restricting access to the area around vulnerable devices may limit an attacker's ability to exploit this vulnerability.**Disable Wi-Fi**For systems that have other connectivity options like wired ethernet, it may be possible and practical to disable Wi-Fi. |

### [Marvell Semiconductor](#NALN-B84SXU) Affected

Notified:  January 04, 2019  Updated: March 18, 2019

### Status

Affected

### Vendor Statement

Marvell was made aware of a potential vulnerability (CVE-2019-6496), which was presented at the ZeroNights conference on November 21-22, 2018, with regard to our 88W8897 device. As Marvell places the highest priority on addressing security concerns, we immediately acted to understand the issue and implemented a fix.

In the presentation, detail was provided to manipulate the open-source Valve Steamlink platform to exploit a memory buffer overflow issue in the device firmware. Unlike this nonsecure
Valve Steamlink platform, the other systems mentioned in the presentation are all closed systems with high-level security protections in place such as DRM. As noted in the presenter’s blog, this would eliminate the ability for an individual to compromise the system
security:

“You may notice, that the majority of devices which use Marvell Wi-Fi are gaming devices, like PS 4 (maybe because of high-performance 802.11ac and Bluetooth COMBO). It’s difficult to research them because of the DRM protection.”

Marvell is not aware of any real world exploitation of this vulnerability outside of a controlled environment. Marvell deployed a fix to address this issue which we have made available in our standard driver and firmware. We have communicated to our direct customers to update to Marvell’s latest firmware and driver to get the most recent security enhancements, including support for WPA3.

Marvell encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support.

### Vendor Information

Marvell issued a [statement](https://www.scribd.com/document/398350818/WiFi-CVE-2019-6496-Marvell-s-Statement) and encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support.

## Document Information

click to expand document informationMarvell was made aware of a potential vulnerability in their 88W8897 device that was presented at a security conference in November 2018. The vulnerability allowed memory buffer overflow in the device firmware when used with the open-source Valve Steamlink platform. Unlike Steamlink, other closed gaming systems that use Marvell Wi-Fi have security protections like DRM that would prevent exploitation. Marvell deployed a fix in their standard driver and firmware and communicated it to customers.

Discovered by Embedi researcher Denis Selianin, the vulnerability impacts the firmware of [Marvell Avastar 88W8897](https://www.marvell.com/wireless/88w8897/), one of the most popular WiFi chipsets on the market, currently deployed with devices such as Sony PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Microsoft Surface laptops, Samsung Chromebooks, Samsung Galaxy J1 smartphones, and Valve SteamLink cast devices, just to name a few.

In a report published today, Selianin described how someone could exploit the Avastar firmware (based on a custom implementation of the ThreadX real-time operating system) to execute malicious code without any user interaction.

"I've managed to identify ~4 total memory corruption issues in some parts of the firmware," said Selianin. "One of the discovered vulnerabilities was a special case of ThreadX block pool overflow. This vulnerability can be triggered without user interaction during the scanning for available networks."

The researcher says the firmware function to scan for new WiFi networks launches automatically every five minutes, making exploitation trivial. All an attacker has to do is send malformed WiFi packets to any device with a Marvell Avastar WiFi chipset and wait until the function launches, to execute malicious code and take over the device.

"That's why this bug is so cool and provides an opportunity to exploit devices literally with zero-click interaction at any state of wireless connection (even when a device isn't connected to any network)," Selianin said.

Furthermore, the researcher says he also identified two methods of exploiting this technique, one that is specific to Marvell's own implementation running on top of the ThreadX firmware, and one that is generic and could be applied to other devices using firmware based on the ThreadX RTOS.

Selianin's [report](https://embedi.org/blog/remotely-compromise-devices-by-using-bugs-in-marvell-avastar-wi-fi-from-zero-knowledge-to-zero-click-rce/) contains the technical details on exploiting the vulnerability and a demo video (embedded below). Proof-of-concept code has not been released, for obvious reasons. Patches are in the works [*UPDATE: Patches have been released, check update at the end of the article*].

*The article's text has been updated on January 22 to highlight that the security issue resides solely in Avastar's own implementation running on top of the ThreadX RTOS, and not ThreadX itself. The update was made based on an official statement received by ZDNet from Express Logic, the company behind the ThreadX RTOS. The most relevant part of the statement has been embedded below, for the clarity and transparency of our reporting:*

> After analyzing the report and media statements regarding the ThreadX-related aspect, we consulted with the author of the initial security analysis who suggested that some of the media reports may have misunderstood the angle and that the security issues described in the original article were not rooted in ThreadX itself. The bottom line is that this vulnerability is not a systemic problem in the ThreadX RTOS. The application firmware and drivers running on the Avastar 88W8897 SoC are solely responsible for and have complete control over the memory corruption cited in this report. In fact, the problem as described could occur on any RTOS, OS, or even without an RTOS. In summary, the vulnerability cited by the author lies with the application firmware, and has absolutely nothing to do with the ThreadX RTOS itself. Hence, none of the extensive 6.2 billion deployments using the ThreadX RTOS are in any way compromised by the ThreadX RTOS code or behavior. This is entirely an application firmware issue.

*In a statement sent to ZDNet on January 26, Marvell said it started rolling out a fix for the vulnerability discovered and reported by the Embedi team. The statement, in full, is available* [*here*](https://www.scribd.com/document/398350818/WiFi-CVE-2019-6496-Marvell-s-Statement)*.*
