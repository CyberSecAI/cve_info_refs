The provided content relates to CVE-2019-6292.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by recursive stack frames in `YAML::SingleDocParser` when handling specific YAML structures. The functions `HandleCompactMap`, `HandleMap`, `HandleFlowSequence`, `HandleSequence`, and `HandleNode` call each other recursively, leading to stack exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Recursive function calls without proper limits or handling of depth.
- Inadequate parsing logic for complex YAML structures.
- Stack overflow vulnerability

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Stack exhaustion, leading to program termination or denial-of-service (DoS).
- Program crash

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation is triggered by providing a specially crafted YAML file to be parsed.
- The attack occurs during the parsing phase when the vulnerable functions are called recursively.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted YAML file, i.e., control over input data.
