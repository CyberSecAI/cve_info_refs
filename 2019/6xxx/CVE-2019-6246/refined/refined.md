The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the `svgpp` library, but does not provide a CVE number for them. Therefore, it is unrelated to the specified CVE.

The following vulnerabilities are described:
**bug1: an oob-read bug**
- **Root cause:** Type confusion. `buffer.pixfmt()` returns a struct that is not `pixfmt_alpha_blend_rgba`, leading to incorrect member access.
- **Weakness:** Type confusion, out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact:** Information leak.
- **Attack vector:**  Specific input to `svgpp` that triggers the type confusion and out-of-bounds read.
- **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to provide crafted input to trigger the vulnerability.

**bug2: a heap-buffer-overflow bug**
- **Root cause:** Repeated calls to `blend_hline` in `render_scanlines_aa_solid` without proper bounds checking leads to heap overflow.
- **Weakness:** Heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact:** Code execution.
- **Attack vector:** Crafted input to `svgpp` that causes multiple calls to `blend_hline` exceeding buffer limits.
- **Required capabilities:** Ability to craft input for `svgpp`.

**bug3: a stack overflow bug**
- **Root cause:** Recursive calls to `agg::cell_aa::not_equal` without a proper exit condition can lead to stack exhaustion.
- **Weakness:** Stack overflow.
- **Impact:** Code execution.
- **Attack vector:** Input to `svgpp` resulting in recursive calls to `agg::cell_aa::not_equal` with specific values.
- **Required capabilities:** Ability to craft input for `svgpp`.

**bug4: a oob-read bug**
- **Root cause:** The return value of `gil::get_color` from the boost library is used as an address, leading to a violation access.
- **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact:** Information leak.
- **Attack vector:**  Specific input to `svgpp` that triggers usage of the return of `gil::get_color` as an address.
- **Required capabilities:** Attacker needs to provide crafted input to trigger the vulnerability.
