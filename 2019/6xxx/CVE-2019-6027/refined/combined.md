**Works Perfectly Amazing**

It helped us to find a lot of hidden content on the site that was hurting us with **SEO**. A lot of lorem ipsum here and there and multi-language details we didn’t see. The template had many small things which we didn’t use and they are all discovered. I like this plugin a lot. Thank you

No idea why there are so many poor reviews but this plugin works great. WordPress lacks tools for spelling check and correction and this particular plugin has done the job while I work on new blog posts. No complaints so far.

I hit the max number of free pages and so paid for upgrade and uploaded and activated upgrade. It sent me in a circle where it said I only have the base version so I don’t need an API key, it wouldn’t recognize the API key and told me to click to their website to upgrade. But that didn’t do anything. I circled between my website a few times and their website locked me out. There was no way to click through to support without logging in. When I finally reached support they told me they could go into my site to try to fix it or just give me a refund if I prefer. They seemed too quick to want access to my site and too fly by night for me to trust them with access so I chose refund. At which point they said i didn’t meet the requirements for a refund and refused to give one. I feel scammed frankly. Whether they are inept, dishonest or both I would not recommend dealing with them or using their glitchy app.

Great idea, was surprised it seemed to be the only plugin of it’s kind. Disappointed to find it does not work and just spins in circles.
