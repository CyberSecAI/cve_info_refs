Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-6111:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `scp` client implementation in OpenSSH, inherited from the older `rcp` protocol, relies on the server to provide the list of files and directories during file transfer operations. The client does not perform adequate validation of object names returned by the server, only preventing directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary vulnerability stems from the `scp` client's lack of proper validation of object names received from the server. Specifically, it does not verify if the filenames sent from the server match those requested by the client.
- **Outdated Protocol:** The `scp` protocol, based on the outdated `rcp`, is inherently flawed in its design, giving the server control over what files/directories are sent to the client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** A malicious or compromised `scp` server, or a Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) attacker, can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files within the target directory on the `scp` client.
- **Subdirectory Manipulation:** With a recursive transfer using the `-r` option, the server can manipulate files and directories in subdirectories on the client. This can potentially be used to overwrite critical configuration files like `.ssh/authorized_keys`, allowing unauthorized access.
- **Client Output Spoofing**: Although not directly related to CVE-2019-6111, the provided content mentions that a related CVE, CVE-2019-6110, allows a malicious server to manipulate client output using ANSI control codes, hiding additional files that are being transferred

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Server:** An attacker controls an `scp` server, which then sends malicious responses to the client.
- **Man-in-The-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts and modifies the communication between a legitimate `scp` server and client. A user accepting an unknown host key is a precondition in this scenario.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs control over the `scp` server or the network connection between the client and server.
- The attacker does not need to compromise the SSH channel directly; the vulnerability is in the SCP protocol implementation.
- For successful exploitation, the user must execute an `scp` command against a malicious or MITM server.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
-  The vulnerability is present in the `scp.c` file, particularly in how it processes the object names from the server.
-  Patches have been developed to address the issue, involving validating the received filenames against the requested ones on the client side.
-  A new `-T` option was added to `scp` which disables the check, for use with known good servers where the wildcard interpretations might differ, but use is at-risk of the original exploit.
- Several vendors of software that include OpenSSH are mentioned in the content as having released fixes including SUSE, Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu and FreeBSD.
- The content also refers to other related CVEs which involve manipulation of the progress meter display and stderr (CVE-2019-6109 and CVE-2019-6110, respectively).
- Some content discusses the outdated nature of the SCP protocol and suggests using more modern protocols like SFTP and rsync.
- It was noted that some fixes for scp were reverted due to incompatibilities and regressions.
