- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A rare issue that, under specific circumstances, can corrupt the internal configuration database of the Forcepoint NGFW Security Management Center (SMC).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Database corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The SMC might produce an incorrect IPsec configuration for the Forcepoint Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), possibly resulting in settings that are weaker than expected.
- **Attack vectors**: Not explicitly described. The circumstances are described as "specific".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Not explicitly described, but it is stated that the attack complexity is high, and no user interaction or privileges are required.
