- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory leak occurs in the `png_create_info_struct` function within `png.c`
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory leak
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Memory exhaustion due to the unreleased memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by running `pngcp poc /dev/null`. The provided poc file `libpng_poc.zip` is needed to reproduce.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker needs to be able to execute the vulnerable code with crafted input (poc file)

The provided information is more detailed than a simple description. It includes a proof of concept, affected file and line number, and the ASAN output detailing the memory leak.
