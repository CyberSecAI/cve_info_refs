Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-6537:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input validation when parsing strings within project files in WECON LeviStudioU. Specifically, the software does not validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** This is the primary vulnerability.  The program attempts to copy user-controlled data to a stack buffer without checking if the data will exceed the buffer size, leading to an overflow if the input is too large.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through maliciously crafted project files. An attacker would need to create a specially crafted project file that, when opened in LeviStudioU, causes a buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes that exploiting this vulnerability requires a low skill level.
*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely; the attacker would need to have access to a system where LeviStudioU is installed and be able to open the malicious project file.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires a user to open a malicious project file, so user interaction is necessary.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected software is WECON LeviStudioU versions 1.8.69 and prior.
*   The vulnerability is associated with CVE-2019-6537, and it has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8.
*   The report mentions that even with the fix in version 1.8.69, exploits are still successful against this updated version.
*   The vulnerability is also described with the CVSS vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), which means:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is easy to execute.
    *   **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No specific privileges are needed.
    *   **UI:R (User Interaction: Required):** Requires user interaction to exploit.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability only affects the exploited component.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality Impact: High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:H (Integrity Impact: High):** There is a high impact on integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability Impact: High):** There is a high impact on availability.

The document also references other related CVEs (CVE-2019-6539 and CVE-2019-6541) which are heap-based buffer overflow and memory corruption respectively, both also having a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 with the same vector string as CVE-2019-6537.
