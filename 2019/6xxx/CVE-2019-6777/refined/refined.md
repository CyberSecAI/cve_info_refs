The provided content relates to CVE-2019-6777.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflective XSS vulnerability in ZoneMinder's plugin.php file. The application accepts user-provided parameters via the 'pl' parameter in the request and outputs them on the page without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `plugin.php` file takes the 'pl' parameter from the request and includes it in the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflective XSS: The application reflects unsanitized user input back to the user, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- Insufficient input validation: The application only filters out characters that are not alphanumeric or hyphens, allowing for other potentially malicious characters.
- Lack of output encoding: The application does not perform HTML escaping/encoding on the 'pl' parameter before rendering it in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- User information leakage: An attacker can potentially steal sensitive information like session cookies by executing malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
- Unauthorized operations: An attacker can perform unauthorized actions by injecting malicious scripts that can manipulate the web page on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET requests: The 'pl' parameter is passed in the request, likely via the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `pl` parameter and convince a user to visit that URL.
- The attacker needs no special access to the server.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided commit log shows a fix for the XSS and directory traversal vulnerabilities. The fix uses `validHtmlStr()` function to sanitize the user input before outputting it on the HTML page, thereby preventing XSS.
- The original issue report indicates that `plugin.php` line 106 is vulnerable.
- The issue report also includes screenshots that demonstrate how a malicious payload passed through the 'pl' parameter is reflected in the HTML output.
