- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. The web application interprets user-supplied input as active HTML, JavaScript, or VBScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the web application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable through the web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device and the ability to send crafted requests to the web application. A low skill level is required to exploit. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L).
