Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6009:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation in the `sns/login_filter.rb` file of SHIRASAGI. Specifically, the application was not properly validating the `ref` parameter used in the login redirection process, allowing for an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect (CWE-601):** The application was accepting an arbitrary URL in the `ref` parameter and redirecting the user to it without proper validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `ref` parameter, an attacker could redirect users to a phishing site, potentially stealing their credentials or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network (AV:N):**  The attacker exploits this vulnerability via a specially crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** The attacker does not need any special privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The user must click on a malicious link or be otherwise redirected to the vulnerable URL in order for the attack to be successful.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability exists in the `login_success` method of `app/controllers/concerns/sns/login_filter.rb`. The original code snippet shows that the application was redirecting based on the `ref` parameter if it started with `/`:

```ruby
if params[:ref].blank?
  redirect_to default_logged_in_path
elsif params[:ref] =~ /^\//
  redirect_to params[:ref]
else
  render "sns/login/redirect"
end
```
The fix implemented in commit `6016948ea535e51b16535888af13df064a1a15d3` changes the regular expression to `/^\/[^\/]/`. This ensures that the `ref` parameter starts with a forward slash followed by at least one character that is not a forward slash, thus only allowing relative paths.

```ruby
if params[:ref].blank?
  redirect_to default_logged_in_path
elsif params[:ref] =~ /^\/[^\/]/
  redirect_to params[:ref]
else
  render "sns/login/redirect"
end
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects SHIRASAGI v1.7.0 and earlier.
- The fix was introduced in v1.8.0.
- The CVSS v3 score is 4.7 (Medium), and the CVSS v2 score is 4.3 (Medium)

In summary, CVE-2019-6009 is an open redirect vulnerability in SHIRASAGI that could be exploited by an attacker to redirect users to malicious websites via a specially crafted URL, which could lead to phishing attacks. The fix implemented checks if the parameter is a relative path before redirecting.
