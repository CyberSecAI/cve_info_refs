- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An unspecified authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Forcepoint NGFW when using LDAP for authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass password authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows unauthorized access to services protected by the NGFW engine, potentially leading to unauthorized access to internal networks and systems.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability affects IPsec VPN, SSL VPN, and browser-based user authentication when LDAP authentication is used.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any specific privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability. They must be able to target one of the affected features (IPsec VPN, SSL VPN, browser-based user authentication) using the LDAP authentication method.
