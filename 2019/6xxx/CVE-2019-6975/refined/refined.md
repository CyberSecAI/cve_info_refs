Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a memory exhaustion issue in the `django.utils.numberformat.format()` function. This function is used by Django's admin interface and several template filters (`floatformat`, `filesizeformat`, and `intcomma`).
- When `format()` receives a `Decimal` object with a large number of digits or a very large exponent, it leads to high memory consumption because of the underlying `'{:f}'.format()` call.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Memory exhaustion:** The primary vulnerability is the potential for memory exhaustion due to the way `format()` handles large `Decimal` objects.
-   **Denial-of-Service (DoS):**  The excessive memory consumption can lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the application unresponsive.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can send requests that include large `Decimal` objects to trigger the vulnerability, causing the server to exhaust memory and become unavailable. This can disrupt normal services for legitimate users.
-   **Resource Consumption:** Successful exploitation will lead to increased memory usage on the server, potentially impacting other services running on the same machine.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Network requests:** Attackers can send crafted requests to the server containing malicious `Decimal` objects as part of form input or URL parameters, or by triggering other code paths that eventually call the `format()` function, e.g., when an admin user is working with data that may contain specially crafted `Decimal` objects, which may be read from the database.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs the ability to send network requests to the server that will cause the vulnerable code to be executed, which means they can be unauthenticated.
-   They need to be able to provide input that leads to large `Decimal` objects being processed by the `django.utils.numberformat.format()` function.

**Additional details:**

- The fix involves limiting the formatting of Decimal objects with more than 200 digits using scientific notation instead of the usual format. This avoids memory exhaustion.
- Patches were applied to Django's main branch, along with release branches 2.2, 2.1, 2.0, and 1.11. New releases (1.11.19, 2.0.11, and 2.1.6) were created to address this.
- A packaging error affected the initial releases, and subsequently, versions 1.11.20, 2.0.13 and 2.1.7 were released as a replacement.
- The vulnerability is present in Django versions before these fixes.
- The issue was reported by Sjoerd Job Postmus.
