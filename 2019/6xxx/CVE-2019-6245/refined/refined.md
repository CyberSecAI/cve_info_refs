CVE-2019-6245 is mentioned in the context of a stack overflow bug within the Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) library, specifically in the function `agg::cell_aa::not_equal`.

Root cause: Infinite recursion due to the condition `dx >= dx_limit` (where `dx = x2 - x1` and `dx_limit = 16384 << poly_subpixel_shift`) remaining true during recursive calls.

Vulnerability: Stack overflow.

Impact of exploitation: Potential code execution.

Attack vector: Processing a malformed file that triggers the recursive calls in `agg::cell_aa::not_equal`.

Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to provide a crafted input file that leads to the described scenario.
