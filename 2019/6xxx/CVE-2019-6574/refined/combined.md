SUMMARY

SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives NXG I and NXG II control contains a denial-of-service
vulnerability within the Parameter Read/Write over Fieldbus network functionality. An attacker with access
to the ﬁeld bus network could cause a Denial-of-Service condition by sending specially crafted packets.
By default, Parameter Read/Write over Fieldbus network is disabled, and this functionality must be
speciﬁcally enabled to expose this vulnerability.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SINAMICS Perfect Harmony GH180 medium voltage converter family is used to control a wide variety
of medium voltage converters or inverters in different applications.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6574

An improperly conﬁgured Parameter Read/Write execution via Field bus network may cause the
controller to restart.

The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the device. Successful
exploitation requires no privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to
compromise the availability of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
