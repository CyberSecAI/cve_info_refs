- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improperly configured Parameter Read/Write execution via the Fieldbus network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives due to the way the Parameter Read/Write functionality over the Fieldbus network is handled. Sending specially crafted packets can cause the controller to restart.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack results in a denial-of-service condition, causing the controller to restart and compromising the availability of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with network access to the device via the fieldbus network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs network access to the device. No privileges or user interaction are required to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker also needs to be able to send crafted packets over the fieldbus network.
