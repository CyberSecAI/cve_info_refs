## Description

You can use this plugin to add a unique CSS class to your pages or posts.

#### Demo

[TasteWP](https://tastewp.com/) has prepared a quick WordPress instance with this plugin, so you can give it a try [in this demo](https://demo.tastewp.com/wp-custom-body-class)

#### Responsiveness

There’s a way to add a class to appear only on mobile devices. You can do that by simply adding `mobile-` on the front of

the class. For example, if you want to have the class “car” for mobile side, you need to use “mobile-car”.

You should be able to enter any valid class-name, including characters like % (percentage) etc. They are useful for some purposes.
