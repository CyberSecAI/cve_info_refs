  "cve": "CVE-2019-6260",
  "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate ASPEED Baseband Management Controller (BMC) hardware and firmware. ASPEED BMC firmware through 2.6 is susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "affected_products": [
    "FAS/AFF Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A320/C190/A220/FAS2720/FAS2750/A800",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H300E/H500E/H700E/H410S",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610C",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H610S",
    "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H615C",
   "NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The ASPEED ast2400 and ast2500 Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) hardware and firmware implement Advanced High-performance Bus (AHB) bridges, which allow arbitrary read and write access to the BMC's physical address space from the host, or from the network if the BMC console uart is attached to a serial concentrator.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "iLPC2AHB bridge Pt I",
    "iLPC2AHB bridge Pt II",
    "PCIe VGA P2A bridge",
      "DMA from/to arbitrary BMC memory via X-DMA",
    "UART-based SoC Debug interface",
    "LPC2AHB bridge",
    "PCIe BMC P2A bridge",
      "Watchdog setup"
  ],
  "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "attack_vectors": [
    "The host processor via AHB bridges on the LPC and PCIe buses",
    "The BMC console UART (hardware password protected)",
    "The ability of the X-DMA engine to address all of the BMCâ€™s M-Bus (memory bus)"
  ],
  "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need either root privileges on the host system or normal user privilege on a remote system with access to the debug UART interface to exploit the vulnerability.",
