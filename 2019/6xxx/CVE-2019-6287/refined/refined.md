Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Rancher not properly removing all roleBindings associated with a user or group when they are removed from a project. Specifically, roleBindings controlling access to namespaces within the project were not being cleaned up.
- This was caused by two logic flaws in how Rancher determines which roleBindings should be deleted upon removal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incomplete Role Revocation:** Rancher failed to fully revoke the privileges of users or groups when they were removed from a project, specifically regarding namespace manipulation.
- **Orphaned RoleBindings:** RoleBindings granting namespace access were not deleted, leaving them active even after a user was removed from the project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Continued Namespace Manipulation:**  Users who have been removed from a project could still create, update, read, and delete namespaces within that project, even though they should no longer have access.
- **Privilege Retention:** Although they could not access resources inside the namespaces (like pods or services), they still had control over the namespace resources themselves.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Rancher UI/API:** While users removed from the project would no longer see the cluster in the UI/API and cannot directly exploit the issue in this manner.
- **kubectl with Kubeconfig:**  If a user had previously created and saved a kubeconfig for the cluster from the Rancher UI, they could use `kubectl` to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Previous Project Membership:** The attacker must have been a member of the project in question and subsequently removed.
- **Retained Kubeconfig (for kubectl attack):**  To exploit the issue via `kubectl`, the attacker must have previously downloaded a kubeconfig file for the affected cluster when they were still a member.
