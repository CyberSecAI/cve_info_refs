Security Advisory: Improper Access Control
Software vulnerability for Video Systems, PSIM and Access
Control Systems – April 3 2019
BOSCH-2019-0404-BT
CVE-2019-6958 (CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.8)

1  Overview and management summary
A recently discovered security vulnerability affects all Bosch Video Management System (BVMS) versions 9.0 and below,
DIVAR IP 2000, 3000, 5000 and 7000, Configuration Manager, Building Integration System (BIS) with Video Engine,
Access Professional Edition (APE), Access Easy Controller (AEC), Bosch Video Client (BVC) and Video SDK (VSDK). The
exact list of affected software versions is available in appendix A of this document.

The vulnerability allows unauthorized read and write access data to the system by injection of RCP+ commands.

In cases where a software update is not possible, a reduction in the system’s network exposure is advised. Internet-
accessible installations should be firewalled, whilst additional steps like network isolation by VLAN, IP filtering features of
the devices and other technologies should be used to decrease the exposure of vulnerable systems. In addition the firewall
on the hosts shall be activated and set according to BVMS and BIS configuration manual. See section 4.2 Firewall on host.

2  Technical details

2.1  Vulnerability classification and solution approach

This vulnerability is classified as ‘Improper Access Control’. The RCP+ network port allows access without authentication.
Adding authentication feature to the respective library fixes the issue. The issue is classified as “CWE-284: Improper
Access Control.”

2.2  CVSS rating

►  The CVSS v3 Base Scores are rated at: 9.8 (Critical) CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

3  Vulnerability fix

3.1  Software updates

The recommended approach is to update the software to a fixed version as soon as possible. Until a fixed software version
is installed, the mitigation approaches firewalling, and IP filtering can be utilized. A list of affected software versions is
available in appendix A of this document.

Patch and installation procedure for the latest BIS versions is available on the Bosch Download Area (Link).

4  Mitigations and workarounds
In case the referenced software patches cannot be applied, e.g. for BVMS versions 7.0 and earlier, before updating to the
latest version, the following measures could mitigate the associated risk.

4.1  Firewalling (network)

It is advised that the system should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes port-
forwarding, which would not protect systems adequately. Firewalling a device significantly reduces its attack surface.

Disable IP-port forwards on the external / internet router for the following services: Video Recording Manager (VRM), Video
Streaming Gateway (VSG) and Mobile Video Service (MVS).

SSH can still be used. (SSH: Secure Shell, a secure communication protocol enabling encryption and mutual
authentication.)

4.2  Firewall on host

For BVMS, DIVAR IP, BIS, APE, AEC and BIS, block port: 40080 TCP

Firewalling should be applied to limit the communication to known devices.

Please see Microsoft TechNet for firewall settings: https://technet.microsoft.com

In general we recommend to open required ports only.

Configure BVMS according the following guidelines. (see configuration manual):

►  https://resource.boschsecurity.com/documents/BVMS_8.0_Configuration_Manual_enUS_35168523659.pdf

►  https://resource.boschsecurity.com/documents/BoschVMS_Configuration_Manual_enUS_28154357131.pdf

4.3  Building Integration System (BIS) without Video Engine

BIS installations without Video Engine are not affected.

In case Video Engine (VSDK) was installed earlier and is not needed any more, e.g. BVMS is used instead of Video
Engine, uninstall VSDK from BIS Client and delete Video Engine folder from BIS Server:
C:\Mgts\ClientDeploy\Packages\Video_Engine
