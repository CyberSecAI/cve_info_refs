Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in relation to CVE-2019-6452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Kyocera printers handle the "Test" button functionality within the machine's address book. When a user configures an entry in the address book with FTP or SMB settings, the printer stores the credentials. However, when the "Test" button is used, instead of using a secure method, it attempts to connect to the configured server using the stored credentials and transmit them in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Transmission:** The primary weakness is the transmission of FTP or SMB passwords in cleartext. This makes the credentials vulnerable to interception by an attacker on the network.
*   **Lack of Secure Test Mechanism:** The printer lacks a secure method for testing network connections, using cleartext credentials instead of more robust methods for credential verification and connection testing.
*  **Abuse of legitimate feature:** The test button, a legitimate function, is abused to extract the password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker can easily intercept the cleartext passwords, gaining unauthorized access to the FTP or SMB server.
*  **Data Breach:** If the compromised FTP/SMB server contains sensitive information, it could lead to a significant data breach.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Once the attacker has the passwords, they can perform malicious actions within the targeted FTP/SMB servers, which could include data manipulation, deletion or malware deployment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** An attacker on the same network as the printer can capture the cleartext credentials.
*   **Rogue Server:** An attacker can configure a rogue server and modify the printer settings (specifically, the server address in the address book) to point to this rogue server. When the user presses the 'Test' button, the printer will transmit credentials to the attacker-controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable printer, or be able to intercept network traffic between the printer and server.
*   **Ability to set up a rogue server:** If exploiting the vulnerability by changing the address book setting, the attacker will need to setup a server to receive the credentials
*   **Basic knowledge of network protocols:** The attacker needs understanding of FTP or SMB protocols, and be able to configure a server to receive the cleartext credentials.
*   **Access to Printer Settings:** While not explicitly stated, changing printer address book settings would require some level of access to the printer's configuration settings.

**Additional Technical Details (from the provided text):**

*   The attacker needs to change the host address in the printer's address book to point to their "rouge" server.
*   The 'Test' button is used to trigger the cleartext password transmission.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by the National Center for Cyber Security Technology.
