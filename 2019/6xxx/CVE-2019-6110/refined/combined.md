```

the sftp code was one of my first contributions to OpenSSH and it
shows - the function names are terrible.

Rename do_blah() to sftp_blah() to make them less so.

Completely mechanical except for sftp_stat() and sftp_lstat() which
change from returning a pointer to a static variable (error-prone) to
taking a pointer to a caller-provided receiver.

add a -X option to both [scp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/scp.1) and [sftp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/sftp.1) to allow control over
some SFTP protocol knobs: the copy buffer length and the number of
inflight requests, both of which are used during upload/download.

Previously these could be controlled in [sftp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/sftp.1) using the -b/-R options.
This makes them available in both SFTP protocol clients using the same
option character sequence.

when [scp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/scp.1) is using the SFTP protocol for transport (the default),

characters but do match literally (e.g. trying to transfer "foo.[1]").

Previously [scp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/scp.1) in SFTP mode would not match these pathnames but
legacy scp/rcp mode would.

```

For open/openat, if the flags parameter does not contain O_CREAT, the
3rd (variadic) mode_t parameter is irrelevant.  Many developers in the past
have passed mode_t (0, 044, 0644, or such), which might lead future people
to copy this broken idiom, and perhaps even believe this parameter has some
meaning or implication or application. Delete them all.
This comes out of a conversation where tb@ noticed that a strange (but
intentional) pledge behaviour is to always knock-out high-bits from
mode_t on a number of system calls as a safety factor, and his bewilderment
that this appeared to be happening against valid modes (at least visually),
but no sorry, they are all irrelevant junk.  They could all be 0xdeafbeef.

Allow for different (but POSIX compliant) behaviour of [basename(3)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/basename.3) and
prevent a use-after-free in that case in the new sftp-compat code.

POSIX allows [basename(3)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/basename.3) to either return a pointer to static storage
or modify the passed string and return a pointer to that.  OpenBSD does
the former and works as is, but on other platforms "filename" points
into "tmp" which was just freed.  This makes the freeing of tmp
consistent with the other variable in the loop.

Pinpointed by the -portable Valgrind regress test.  ok djm@ deraadt@

files due to differences between client and server wildcard expansion rules.

For this reason, this also adds a new -T flag to disable the check.

```

To prevent screwing up terminal settings when printing to the
terminal, for ASCII and UTF-8, escape bytes not forming characters
and bytes forming non-printable characters with [vis(3)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/vis.3) VIS_OCTAL.
For other character sets, abort printing of the current string in
these cases.  In particular,
* let [scp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/scp.1) respect the local user's LC_CTYPE [locale(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/locale.1);
* sanitize data received from the remote host;
* sanitize filenames, usernames, and similar data even locally;
* take character display widths into account for the progressmeter.

This is believed to be sufficient to keep the local terminal safe
on OpenBSD, but bad things can still happen on other systems with
state-dependent locales because many places in the code print
unencoded ASCII characters into the output stream.

Using feedback from djm@ and martijn@,
various aspects discussed with many others.

deraadt@ says it should go in now, i probably already hesitated too long

Replace <sys/param.h> with <limits.h> and other less dirty headers where
possible.  Annotate <sys/param.h> lines with their current reasons.  Switch
to PATH_MAX, NGROUPS_MAX, HOST_NAME_MAX+1, LOGIN_NAME_MAX, etc.  Change
MIN() and MAX() to local definitions of MINIMUM() and MAXIMUM() where
sensible to avoid pulling in the pollution.  These are the files confirmed

```

When passing user-controlled options with arguments to other programs,
pass the option and option argument as separate argv entries and
not smashed into one (e.g., as -l foo and not -lfoo).  Also, always
pass a "--" argument to stop option parsing, so that a positional
argument that starts with a '-' isn't treated as an option.  This
fixes some error cases as well as the handling of hostnames and
filenames that start with a '-'.

change OpenSSH's xrealloc() function from being xrealloc(p, new_size) to

realloc is particularly prone to integer overflows because it is almost
always allocating "n * size" bytes, so this is a far safer API;

Add support for [tun(4)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/tun.4) forwarding over OpenSSH, based on an idea and
initial channel code bits by markus@. This is a simple and easy way to
use OpenSSH for ad hoc virtual private network connections, e.g.
administrative tunnels or secure wireless access. It's based on a new
ssh channel and works similar to the existing TCP forwarding support,
except that it depends on the [tun(4)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/tun.4) network interface on both ends of
the connection for layer 2 or layer 3 tunneling. This diff also adds
support for LocalCommand in the [ssh(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/ssh.1) client.

If copying multiple files to a target file (which normally fails, as it
must be a target directory), kill the spawned ssh child before exiting.
This stops it trying to authenticate and spewing lots of output.

Switch atomicio to use a simpler interface; it now returns a size_t
(containing number of bytes read/written), and indicates error by
returning 0.  EOF is signalled by errno==EPIPE.
Typical use now becomes:

if (atomicio(read, ..., len) != len)
        err(1,"read");

Have scp and sftp wait for the spawned ssh to exit before they exit
themselves.  This prevents ssh from being unable to restore terminal

```

i bet a lot of people didn't know what ssh 1.2.16 had a nice license.
well, except for the patent issues.  someone in sweden (forget their
name at the moment) cleaned out most of the patented code, and now
this code removes rsa code.  when this is done, it will link against
libssl, but the work isn't completely done yet.  then we need to bring
this up to modern days, featurewise.

# CVE-2019-6109

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-5953.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-6110.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-6109 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-6109)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This affects refresh\_progress\_meter() in progressmeter.c.

Title:     SSHtranger Things
Author:    Mark E. Haase <mhaase@hyperiongray.com>
Homepage:  https://www.hyperiongray.com
Date:      2019-01-17
CVE:       CVE-2019-6111, CVE-2019-6110
Advisory:  https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-client-multiple-vulnerabilities.txt
Tested on: Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS, OpenSSH client 7.6p1

We have nicknamed this "SSHtranger Things" because the bug is so old it could be
exploited by an 8-bit Demogorgon. Tested on Python 3.6.7 and requires `paramiko`
package.

The server listens on port 2222. It accepts any username and password, and it
generates a new host key every time you run it.

    $ python3 sshtranger_things.py

Download a file using a vulnerable client. The local path must be a dot:

    $ scp -P 2222 foo@localhost:test.txt .
    The authenticity of host '[localhost]:2222 ([127.0.0.1]:2222)' can't be established.
    RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:C7FhMqqiMpkqG9j+11S2Wv9lQYlN1jkDiipdeFMZT1w.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:2222' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    foo@localhost's password:
    test.txt                                       100%   32     0.7KB/s   00:00

The file you requested (e.g. test.txt) will be saved in your current directory.
If your client is vulnerable, you will have an additional file "exploit.txt"
created in your current directory.

    $ cat test.txt
    This is the file you requested.
    $ cat exploit.txt
    SSHtranger Things

The interesting code is in ScpServer.send_file().

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

scp client multiple vulnerabilities
===================================
The latest version of this advisory is available at:
https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-client-multiple-vulnerabilities.txt
Overview
--------
SCP clients from multiple vendors are susceptible to a malicious scp server performing
unauthorized changes to target directory and/or client output manipulation.
Description
-----------
Many scp clients fail to verify if the objects returned by the scp server match those
it asked for. This issue dates back to 1983 and rcp, on which scp is based. A separate
flaw in the client allows the target directory attributes to be changed arbitrarily.
Finally, two vulnerabilities in clients may allow server to spoof the client output.
Impact
------
Malicious scp server can write arbitrary files to scp target directory, change the
target directory permissions and to spoof the client output.
Details
-------
The discovered vulnerabilities, described in more detail below, enables the attack
described here in brief.
1. The attacker controlled server or Man-in-the-Middle(\*) attack drops .bash\_aliases
file to victim's home directory when the victim performs scp operation from the
server. The transfer of extra files is hidden by sending ANSI control sequences
via stderr. For example:
user@local:~$ scp user@remote:readme.txt .
readme.txt 100% 494 1.6KB/s 00:00
user@local:~$
2. Once the victim launches a new shell, the malicious commands in .bash\_aliases get
executed.
\*) Man-in-the-Middle attack does require the victim to accept the wrong host
fingerprint.
Vulnerabilities
---------------
1. CWE-20: scp client improper directory name validation [CVE-2018-20685]
The scp client allows server to modify permissions of the target directory by using empty
("D0777 0 \n") or dot ("D0777 0 .\n") directory name.
2. CWE-20: scp client missing received object name validation [CVE-2019-6111]
Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp [1], the server chooses which
files/directories are sent to the client. However, scp client only perform cursory
validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented).
A malicious scp server can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory.
If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories
as well (for example overwrite .ssh/authorized\_keys).
The same vulnerability in WinSCP is known as CVE-2018-20684.
3. CWE-451: scp client spoofing via object name [CVE-2019-6109]
Due to missing character encoding in the progress display, the object name can be used
to manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes to hide additional
files being transferred.
4. CWE-451: scp client spoofing via stderr [CVE-2019-6110]
Due to accepting and displaying arbitrary stderr output from the scp server, a
malicious server can manipulate the client output, for example to employ ANSI codes
to hide additional files being transferred.
Proof-of-Concept
----------------
Proof of concept malicious scp server will be released at a later date.
Vulnerable versions
-------------------
The following software packages have some or all vulnerabilities:
ver #1 #2 #3 #4
OpenSSH scp <=7.9 x x x x
PuTTY PSCP ? - - x x
WinSCP scp mode <=5.13 - x - -
Tectia SSH scpg3 is not affected since it exclusively uses sftp protocol.
Mitigation
----------
1. OpenSSH
1.1 Switch to sftp if possible
1.2 Apply the following patches to scp:
CVE-2018-20685: https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=6010c0303a422a9c5fa8860c061bf7105eb7f8b2
CVE-2019-6109: https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=8976f1c4b2721c26e878151f52bdf346dfe2d54c
CVE-2019-6111: https://anongit.mindrot.org/openssh.git/commit/?id=391ffc4b9d31fa1f4ad566499fef9176ff8a07dc
1.3 Alternatively apply the following patch to harden scp against most server-side
manipulation attempts: https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-name-validator.patch
NOTE: This unofficial patch may cause problems if the the remote and local shells
don't agree on the way glob() pattern matching works. YMMV.
2. PuTTY
2.1 No fix is available yet
3. WinSCP
3.1. Upgrade to WinSCP 5.14 or later
Similar or prior work
---------------------
1. CVE-2000-0992 - scp overwrites arbitrary files

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being
derived from 1983 rcp, the server chooses which files/directories are sent
to the client. However, the scp client only performs cursory validation of
the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented).
A malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite
arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation
(-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for
example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized\_keys file).

## Notes

---

### [seth-arnold](https://launchpad.net/~seth-arnold)

openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
sftp instead of scp.
The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.
The initial USN was incomplete and did not include the second
commit.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Restrict access to the affected systems, especially to ports 22/tcp and 443/tcp to trusted IP

addresses only

• Deactivate the webserver if not required, and if deactivation is supported by the product

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE X-204RNA Industrial Ethernet network access points enable the cost-effective connection
of non-PRP terminal devices to separate parallel networks, where a high availability is required.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2003-0190

OpenSSH-portable (OpenSSH) 3.6.1p1 and earlier with PAM support enabled immediately sends
an error message when a user does not exist, which allows remote attackers to determine valid
usernames via a timing attack.

5.3
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
CWE-208: Observable Timing Discrepancy

Vulnerability CVE-2003-1562

sshd in OpenSSH 3.6.1p2 and earlier, when PermitRootLogin is disabled and using PAM keyboard-
interactive authentication, does not insert a delay after a root login attempt with the correct password,
which makes it easier for remote attackers to use timing differences to determine if the password step
of a multi-step authentication is successful, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0190.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-1552

OpenSSL has internal defaults for a directory tree where it can ﬁnd a conﬁguration ﬁle as well as
certiﬁcates used for veriﬁcation in TLS. This directory is most commonly referred to as OPENSSLDIR,
and is conﬁgurable with the –preﬁx / –openssldir conﬁguration options. For OpenSSL versions 1.1.0
and 1.1.1, the mingw conﬁguration targets assume that resulting programs and libraries are installed
in a Unix-like environment and the default preﬁx for program installation as well as for OPENSSLDIR
should be ‘/usr/local’. However, mingw programs are Windows programs, and as such, ﬁnd themselves
looking at sub-directories of ‘C:/usr/local’, which may be world writable, which enables untrusted users
to modify OpenSSL’s default conﬁguration, insert CA certiﬁcates, modify (or even replace) existing
engine modules, etc. For OpenSSL 1.0.2, ‘/usr/local/ssl’ is used as default for OPENSSLDIR on
all Unix and Windows targets, including Visual C builds. However, some build instructions for the
diverse Windows targets on 1.0.2 encourage you to specify your own –preﬁx. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1, 1.1.0 and 1.0.2 are affected by this issue. Due to the limited scope of affected deployments this

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6109

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding in the progress display,
a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can employ crafted object names to manipulate
the client output, e.g., by using ANSI control codes to hide additional ﬁles being transferred. This
affects refresh_progress_meter() in progressmeter.c.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-6111

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp,
the server chooses which ﬁles/directories are sent to the client. However, the scp client only performs
cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A
malicious scp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary ﬁles in the scp client
target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as
well (for example, to overwrite the .ssh/authorized_keys ﬁle).

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2019-16905

OpenSSH 7.7 through 7.9 and 8.x before 8.1, when compiled with an experimental key type, has a
pre-authentication integer overﬂow if a client or server is conﬁgured to use a crafted XMSS key. This
leads to memory corruption and local code execution because of an error in the XMSS key parsing
algorithm. NOTE: the XMSS implementation is considered experimental in all released OpenSSH
versions, and there is no supported way to enable it when building portable OpenSSH.

## Notes

---

### [seth-arnold](https://launchpad.net/~seth-arnold)

openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
sftp instead of scp.
Per https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-dev/2019-January/037475.html
upstream doesn't consider this to be a vulnerability, and as of
2020-07-07, there is no upstream fix. We will not be fixing
this issue in Ubuntu stable releases.

An issue was discovered in OpenSSH 7.9. Due to missing character encoding
in the progress display, a malicious server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker)
can employ crafted object names to manipulate the client output, e.g., by
using ANSI control codes to hide additional files being transferred. This
affects refresh\_progress\_meter() in progressmeter.c.

## Notes

---

### [seth-arnold](https://launchpad.net/~seth-arnold)

openssh-ssh1 is provided for compatibility with old devices that
cannot be upgraded to modern protocols. Thus we may not provide security
support for this package if doing so would prevent access to equipment.

---

### [mdeslaur](https://launchpad.net/~mdeslaur)

The recommended workaround for this issue is to switch to using
sftp instead of scp.
The updates in USN-3885-1 inverted two CVE numbers by accident.

## [OpenSSH]

[OpenSSH 9.9](releasenotes.html#9.9p1) released September 20, 2024

OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login with the SSH protocol.
It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking,
and other attacks.
In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure tunneling capabilities,
several authentication methods, and sophisticated configuration options.

The OpenSSH suite consists of the following tools:

* Remote operations are done using
  [ssh](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1),
  [scp](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1),
  and
  [sftp](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1).* Key management with
    [ssh-add](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1),
    [ssh-keysign](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8),
    [ssh-keyscan](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1), and
    [ssh-keygen](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1).* The service side consists of
      [sshd](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8),
      [sftp-server](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8), and
      [ssh-agent](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1).

OpenSSH is developed by a few developers of the
[OpenBSD Project](https://www.openbsd.org) and made available
under a BSD-style license.

OpenSSH is incorporated into many commercial products, but very few of those
companies assist OpenSSH with funding.

Contributions towards OpenSSH can be sent to the
[OpenBSD Foundation](https://www.openbsd.org/donations.html).

#### Computer Forensics / Chain of Custody / Legal Expertise

When Hyperion Gray took up with some of the best in counter cyber crime, and they were cops, we were a little taken aback and wary. After working some ideas and talking shop with Major Perera and his crew - we were blown away. These aren't just any old computer forensics experts, they're the best. Who would know better about chain of custody and forensics than counter cyber crime cops? Yeah, pretty much no one.

```

Replace all calls to [signal(2)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/signal.2) with a wrapper around [sigaction(2)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/sigaction.2).
This wrapper blocks all other signals during the handler preventing
races between handlers, and sets SA_RESTART which should reduce the
potential for short read/write operations.

Backout rev. 1.43 for now.

The function update_progress_meter() calls refresh_progress_meter()
which calls snmprintf() which calls malloc(); but update_progress_meter()
acts as the SIGALRM signal handler.

"malloc(): error: recursive call" reported by sobrado@.

```

To prevent screwing up terminal settings when printing to the
terminal, for ASCII and UTF-8, escape bytes not forming characters
and bytes forming non-printable characters with [vis(3)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/vis.3) VIS_OCTAL.
For other character sets, abort printing of the current string in
these cases.  In particular,
* let [scp(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/scp.1) respect the local user's LC_CTYPE [locale(1)](http://man.OpenBSD.org/locale.1);
* sanitize data received from the remote host;
* sanitize filenames, usernames, and similar data even locally;
* take character display widths into account for the progressmeter.

This is believed to be sufficient to keep the local terminal safe
on OpenBSD, but bad things can still happen on other systems with
state-dependent locales because many places in the code print
unencoded ASCII characters into the output stream.

Using feedback from djm@ and martijn@,
various aspects discussed with many others.

deraadt@ says it should go in now, i probably already hesitated too long
