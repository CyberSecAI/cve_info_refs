- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The monitor barrier feature in affected SCALANCE X switches does not sufficiently block data from being forwarded over the mirror port into the mirrored network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient data blocking by the monitor barrier.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can transmit malicious packets to systems within the mirrored network, potentially influencing their configuration and runtime behavior. This could result in limited impact to confidentiality and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can send packets through the mirror port that are forwarded into the mirrored network, thus injecting packets into the monitored network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send traffic to the mirror port.
