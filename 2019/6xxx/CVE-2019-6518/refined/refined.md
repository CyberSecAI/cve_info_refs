Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the devices storing user passwords in plaintext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected Storage of Credentials (CWE-256):** The core issue is the lack of proper encryption or hashing of stored passwords. Instead, they are stored in a readable, plaintext format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the device's storage can directly read the plaintext passwords. This access could lead to further compromise of the device and potentially other systems or accounts that use the same credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** An attacker with physical access to the device could potentially retrieve the stored plaintext passwords from device storage.
*   **Remote Access:** If an attacker can gain access through other vulnerabilities on the device or via network access (e.g., by exploiting a different vulnerability or gaining unauthorized network access), they could potentially access the storage where the plaintext credentials are kept.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be in a position to access the device's storage. This could be achieved through:
    *   Physical access to the device.
    *   Remote access via exploitation of other vulnerabilities on the device
    *   Unauthorized network access

**Additional Information:**

*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5, with the vector string (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). This indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable with no user interaction required. The confidentiality impact is rated high, while integrity and availability impacts are none.

*   **Affected Devices:** The affected Moxa industrial switches include the IKS-G6824A series, EDS-405A series, EDS-408A series, and EDS-510A series, with specific firmware version numbers detailed in the advisory.
