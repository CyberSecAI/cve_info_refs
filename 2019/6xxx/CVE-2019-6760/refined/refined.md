    "summary": "Foxit Reader ConvertToPDF JPG File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability",
    "details": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Foxit Reader. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within ConvertToPDF_x86.dll. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated object.
