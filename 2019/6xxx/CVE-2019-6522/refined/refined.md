Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6522:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly check array bounds within the affected Moxa industrial switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** The primary vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to improper array boundary checks. This allows an attacker to potentially read device memory at arbitrary locations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could read sensitive data stored in the device's memory.
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability may cause the device to reboot or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, implying that attackers can target the affected device through the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory mentions "low skill level to exploit," suggesting that exploiting this vulnerability doesn't require extensive technical expertise.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The CVSS vector string indicates no privileges are required (PR:N).

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Specific Moxa IKS and EDS series industrial switches, with firmware versions prior to the patched ones, are affected.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.1. The vector string is AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H, further specifying the characteristics of the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation:** The primary mitigation is to update the firmware of the affected devices to a patched version. Setting the EDS series web configuration to "https only" is mentioned as a mitigation for other vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory, but not this specific one.
