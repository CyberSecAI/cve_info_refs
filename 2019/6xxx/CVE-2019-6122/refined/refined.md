Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-6122:

**Verification:**

The content directly mentions CVE-2019-6122 and provides context on how it was discovered in NiceHash Miner software, aligning with the description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper authorization checks in NiceHash Miner software. Specifically, when adding a cryptocurrency wallet to a user's account, the software did not verify that the email address entered belonged to the user initiating the action. This allowed attackers to input any email and retrieve associated user data if the email address was registered with NiceHash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Username Enumeration:** The NiceHash software revealed whether a provided email address was valid or invalid, providing a way for attackers to enumerate user accounts.
2.  **Missing Rate Limit:**  There was no rate limiting on how many times an attacker could attempt to add a wallet, allowing them to test multiple email addresses quickly.
3. **Missing Authorization Check:** The software did not verify that the email address was entered by the legitimate owner when a wallet was added using their email address, or when an attacker tried to view someone else's information by inputting their email.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could access a NiceHash miner's recent payment history, BTC wallet address, mining history, and associated worker information if they knew the miner's email.
*   **Privacy Violation:**  This was a GDPR violation and resulted in unintended exposure of sensitive user data, including their financial transactions and mining activities.
*   **Potential Real-World Risks:** As the article points out, the knowledge of a user's crypto-mining activities could lead to issues like legal trouble, employer issues, or in extreme scenarios, kidnapping and ransom.

**Attack Vectors:**

The attack vector was through the NiceHash Miner software for Windows. The attacker would use the "add wallet" functionality in the application using any email address, then use the "view online stats" to retrieve the associated data for that email address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needed to have knowledge of the victim's email address registered with NiceHash. This email was used as the identifier in the vulnerability.
*   The attacker needed to use the vulnerable NiceHash Miner software v2.0.2.8 or earlier to exploit it.
*  The attacker needs a network connection to contact the NiceHash server and retrieve the data, or in the case of enumeration, needs to see the responses from the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in the NiceHash miner for Windows (v2.0.2.8) before a fix in v2.0.3.0, which removed email address support for adding BTC wallets and introduced authorization checks.
*   The vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to gather large amounts of information on NiceHash users.
*   The article details a specific scenario where an attacker used OSINT (Twitter, LinkedIn) to find a miner's email address.
*   NiceHash acknowledged the vulnerability and fixed it but did not reimburse or provide T-shirts for the security researcher.
