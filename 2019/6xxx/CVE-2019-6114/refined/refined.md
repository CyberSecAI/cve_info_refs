- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An integer overflow occurs in the jp2 parsing library of Corel PaintShop Pro 2019 during the parsing of a jp2 file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can lead to a buffer overflow that overwrites adjacent memory (including heap-allocated classes), which can result in arbitrary code execution. The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) causes a large memory corruption and program crash.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious jp2 file, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow when the file is parsed by Corel PaintShop Pro 2019.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious jp2 file to the vulnerable software.
