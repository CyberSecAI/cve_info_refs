### Contribution description

The receive thread of the MQTT-SN implementation emcute returns from the packet receive loop if `sock_udp_recv` returns an error. This is, for instance, the case when a given packet doesn't fit into the supplied buffer. This condition can be triggered by anyone able to send large packets (> 512 byte) to the UDP socket. If so, this will stop the MQTT client from working until the device is restarted, i.e. `emcute_run` is invoked again.

[RIOT/sys/net/application\_layer/emcute/emcute.c](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/blob/89afc378a92bf198246335fd2fa64a76dfe6e00e/sys/net/application_layer/emcute/emcute.c#L515-L521)

in
[89afc37](/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/89afc378a92bf198246335fd2fa64a76dfe6e00e)

|  | while (1) { |
| --- | --- |
|  | ssize\_t len = sock\_udp\_recv(&sock, rbuf, sizeof(rbuf), t\_out, &remote); |
|  |  |
|  | if ((len < 0) && (len != -ETIMEDOUT)) { |
|  | LOG\_ERROR("[emcute] error while receiving UDP packet\n"); |
|  | return; |
|  | } |

### Testing procedure

My tap configuration is as follows:

```
4: tap0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc pfifo_fast state UP group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 32:e2:ba:2b:07:d1 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
    inet6 fe80::30e2:baff:fe2b:7d1/64 scope link
       valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever

```

1. Enable debug in `sys/net/application_layer/emcute/emcute.c`.
2. Compile and run `examples/emcute_mqttsn`.
3. Connect to a bugos MQTT server address.
4. Spoof a server reply with a packet exceeding the default buffer size (512 byte). This causes `sock_udp_recv` to return `-ENOBUFS`.
5. Attempt to connect to a real working MQTT server (will fail).

```
MQTT-SN example application

Type 'help' to get started. Have a look at the README.md for more information.
> con fe80::30e2:baff:fe2b:7d1 2342

```

Spoof the reply, e.g. using:

```
head -c 525 < /dev/urandom  | busybox nc -p 2342 -u 'fe80::30e2:baff:fe2b:7d2%tap0' 1883

```

This should cause `emcute_run` to return and output the message `[emcute] error while receiving UDP packet`. Afterwards, it should no longer be possible to connect to a working MQTT-SN server since emcute will nerver receive the CONNACK reply from it since it doesn't read from the socket anymore.

### Impact

Denial of service, a spoofed server message will cause the emcute client to stop working until `emcute_run` is invoked again which is usually the case when the device is restarted.

Sorry, something went wrong.

The change makes sense, the emcute server thread should not exit on client error.

| Ok, wasn't that hard...: [edae2c2](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/edae2c268abc7fd69d784b8b8f67d1aa98b3fb03). I was able to confirm this bug fix using that patch and cherry-picking [74e19d4](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/74e19d451cfa4397b58745a1efcfce81d2eb6426) and [10a3f3e](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/commit/10a3f3e8ed7f94596379b2edc0ac2a86a2699cbd) on top (and without of course). |
