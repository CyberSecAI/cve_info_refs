The provided content is related to CVE-2019-17551.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied data. Specifically, the "mainForm:loanNotesnotes:0:rich_text_editor_note_text" parameter, within the "WFS/agreementView.faces" page in the Notes section of the Wholesale Finance Floorplanning System, is not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The main weakness is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). User-provided data is not properly neutralized before being used to generate a web page.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary HTML and script code within a user's browser, in the context of the vulnerable website. This can lead to:
    - Stealing potentially sensitive information.
    - Changing the appearance of the web page.
    - Performing phishing attacks.
    - Drive-by-download attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
   - A remote attacker can create a specially crafted link.
   - They then trick a victim into clicking this link.
   - The malicious code embedded in the link is executed in the user's browser when the page is loaded.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker can be remote (i.e., no need for local access to the system).
    - The attacker needs to trick a user to interact with a specially crafted link (user interaction required).
    - No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability

**Vulnerable Software:** Wholesale Finance Floorplanning System versions 6.31.8.3 - 6.31.8.5
