The provided content relates to CVE-2019-17445.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the agent executable's failure to properly set its working directory upon startup when installed for non-root operations (scanning). This allows the agent to be tricked into following symbolic links to copy files from the filesystem to unintended locations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Symbolic Link Following vulnerability. The agent does not properly handle symbolic links, leading to potential file manipulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- File content exposure: Sensitive files could be accessed by unauthorized users through the copy operation
- File corruption: Files could be overwritten or corrupted.
- Denial-of-service: The vulnerability could potentially lead to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local login to non-privileged account on the Linux system where an affected agent version is installed for non-root operations.
- Manipulation of symbolic links.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user access to a non-privileged account.
- Ability to create or modify symbolic links on the filesystem.
