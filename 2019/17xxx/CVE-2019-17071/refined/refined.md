Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-17071:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the "Client Dash" plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the `input name` attribute in the plugin's code accepts HTML tags without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin fails to sanitize user-supplied input in the `name` attribute of an input field allowing injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to actions like:
   - Stealing cookies, which can be used to impersonate the user.
   - Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
   - Modifying the content of the page.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker (likely an authenticated user with sufficient privileges to modify plugin settings or configuration) can inject malicious HTML into the `name` attribute of the input field within the Client Dash plugin settings.
- The specific payload example provided is: `<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" onload="alert(document.domain)"/>`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate input fields handled by the vulnerable plugin on the affected WordPress instance. This would typically require administrative or editor-level access to the WordPress site.

**Additional notes:**
- The provided information notes that the "Client Dash" plugin is vulnerable to XSS. The `input name` attribute in the `render()` function was the vulnerability point. This function allows HTML tag injections, such as the SVG payload.
- The WordPress plugin page confirms the plugin has been closed due to a security issue.
