# 74cms v5.2.8 SQLI

### Detail

The vulnerability is generated by the `_list` method in the `Common/Controller/BackendController.class.php` file, using the `I()` in the `_list` method to receive the `sort` and `order` parameters, and the splicing assignment to `$order_by`.

[![](/Ers4tz/vuln/raw/master/img/1.png)](/Ers4tz/vuln/blob/master/img/1.png)

`$order_by` enters the `SQL` query by splicing, resulting in `SQL` injection.

[![](/Ers4tz/vuln/raw/master/img/3.png)](/Ers4tz/vuln/blob/master/img/3.png)

The `_list` method is called in the `index` method.

[![](/Ers4tz/vuln/raw/master/img/4.png)](/Ers4tz/vuln/blob/master/img/4.png)

Taking `Admin/Controller/AdController.class.php` as an example, the `AdController` class inherits the `BackendController` class and calls `index()` in the `category` method.
