Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17000:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that an `<object>` tag with a `data:` URI did not correctly inherit the document's Content Security Policy (CSP). Specifically, if a document's CSP allowed `data:` URIs, a cross-origin frame could bypass the CSP by using an object tag.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSP Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is a bypass of the Content Security Policy. The intended security mechanism designed to control the resources a browser is allowed to load was not being properly enforced for `<object>` tags with `data:` URIs.
- **Incorrect Policy Inheritance:** The vulnerability highlights that the CSP was not being inherited by the content loaded via the `data:` URI within the object tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** An attacker could inject malicious code by embedding it within the `data:` URI.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  While the `data:` URI content itself was in a unique-origin frame, this CSP bypass could allow an attacker to potentially execute scripts that could have access to resources depending on how the site's CSP was configured. This is a potential XSS attack vector.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious `<object>` Tag:** The primary attack vector is the use of a crafted `<object>` tag with a `data:` URI containing malicious script.
- **Cross-Origin Frame:** The bypass occurs specifically within a cross-origin frame, if the parent frame's CSP allows `data:` URIs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject HTML:** An attacker needs to be able to inject arbitrary HTML into a web page. This could be through a separate vulnerability or if the attacker controls some part of a site.
- **Target site with data: URI allowed in CSP:** The target website needs to have a CSP that explicitly allows data: URIs for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- This vulnerability is related to bug [1441096](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441096)
- The issue was fixed by bug [1555043](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1555043).
- The vulnerability affects Firefox versions before 70.
- The fix for this issue also addressed another similar issue, CVE-2019-17001, which was a different bypass, this time with `script-src 'none'`.
- The bug report notes that while the content from `data:` URI doesn't inherit the parent's CSP, the loaded content runs in a unique-origin frame and does not have access to the parent's data, though scripts may still run.
- The bug is classified as "sec-moderate" which indicates a significant, but not critical, security flaw.
- This is a public vulnerability.
- The fix landed in Firefox 70.
