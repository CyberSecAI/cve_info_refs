## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 70

**Note:** We have updated this advisory on June 26, 2020 to include CVE-2020-12412 and on March 20, 2023 to include CVE-2019-25136, which were fixed in Firefox 70 but not recognized or acknowledged immediately.

#### [#CVE-2018-6156: Heap buffer overflow in FEC processing in WebRTC](#CVE-2018-6156)

Reporter
Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect derivation of a packet length in WebRTC caused heap corruption via a crafted video file. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1480088](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1480088)

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

* [Bug 1584907](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584907)

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When storing a value in IndexedDB, the value's prototype chain is followed and it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577107)

#### [#CVE-2019-25136: Invalid styles allowed from content processes](#CVE-2019-25136)

Reporter
Emilio Cobos Álvarez
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised child process could have injected XBL Bindings into privileged CSS rules, resulting in arbitrary code execution and a sandbox escape.

##### References

* [Bug 1530709](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530709)

#### [#CVE-2020-12412: Address bar spoof using history navigation and blocked ports](#CVE-2020-12412)

Reporter
Adrian Karolak from ING Tech Poland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By navigating a tab using the history API, an attacker could cause the address bar to display the incorrect domain (with the https:// scheme, a blocked port number such as '1', and without a lock icon) while controlling the page contents.

##### References

* [Bug 1528587](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528587)

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577953](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577953)

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1577719](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577719)

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

##### References

* [Bug 1561502](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502)

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

##### References

* [Bug 1582857](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857)

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters, enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

##### References

* [Bug 1584216](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584216)

#### [#CVE-2019-11765: Incorrect permissions could be granted to a website](#CVE-2019-11765)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process that would cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission.

* [Bug 1562582](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1562582)

#### [#CVE-2019-17000: CSP bypass using object tag with data: URI](#CVE-2019-17000)

Reporter
Yangzheng Li
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An object tag with a data URI did not correctly inherit the document's Content Security Policy. This allowed a CSP bypass in a cross-origin frame if the document's policy explicitly allowed `data:` URIs.

##### References

* [Bug 1441468](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441468)

#### [#CVE-2019-17001: CSP bypass using object tag when script-src 'none' is specified](#CVE-2019-17001)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Content-Security-Policy that blocks in-line scripts could be bypassed using an object tag to execute JavaScript in the protected document (cross-site scripting). This is a separate bypass from CVE-2019-17000.
*Note: This flaw only affected Firefox 69 and was not present in earlier versions.*

#### [#CVE-2019-17002: upgrade-insecure-requests was not being honored for links dragged and dropped](#CVE-2019-17002)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
low
##### Description

If `upgrade-insecure-requests` was specified in the Content Security Policy, and a link was dragged and dropped from that page, the link was not upgraded to https.

#### [#CVE-2019-11764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2](#CVE-2019-11764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

## Bugzilla Field Descriptions

Alias
A short, unique name assigned to a bug in order to assist with looking it up and referring to it in other places in Bugzilla.Assignee
This is the person in charge of resolving the bug. Every time this field changes, the status changes to NEW to make it easy to see which new bugs have appeared on a person's list.Blocks
This bug must be resolved before the bugs listed in this field can be resolved.Bug ID
The numeric id of a bug, unique within this entire installation of Bugzilla.CC
Users who may not have a direct role to play on this bug, but who are interested in its progress.Changed
When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

[browser-plugins.js#44](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/browser-plugins.js#44) has a broken security model. One of the parameters that it `receiveMessage`s from the child is `message.data.plugin`. This includes information about the plug-in to show the "click-to-play" prompt. The problem is that it takes the permissions that is used in the call to `Services.perms.addFromPrincipal` from the child. In my testing it was possible to add "uitours" permission to an arbitrary host.

There is a mitigation in that it did actually require the user interaction to "click-to-play" but then it added the wrong permission. Because of the mitigation here, and because it's *only* permissions, which for the most part aren't that powerful, I'm rating this sec-moderate. That said, its a simple fix and we really should do something about it.

To see the code flow for that bad path, see the LGTM query [here](https://mozilla.demo.semmle.com/query/5493105358251619941/). Scroll to bottom and then click "Show Paths" to see the vulnerable data flows.

I confirmed this was a bug by testing in the debugger, and modifying the permissionString value at /browser-plugins.js#44.

This should be fixed on current tip now that [bug 1505913](/show_bug.cgi?id=1505913 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Fission] Make Plugin Click-to-Play Fission-aware") is fixed. Paul, can you confirm?

Harder to evaluate without permalinks in the first comment :)

Looking at the diff; the path I see that's vulnerable is receiving a message 'ShowClickToPlayNotification' that provides `msg.principal`. The principal - previously provided by the content process - is now obtained from `this.browsingContext.currentWindowGlobal.documentPrincipal`.

But Paul's initial comment seems like something different; so maybe I missed a flow. He seems to be talking about providing an alternate permission... Previously, that came from `aPluginInfo.permissionString`; now it comes from `aActivationInfo`. Previously the permissionString in aPluginInfo came from `plugins` and argument to showClickToPlayNotification where it came from the content process in `msg.data.plugins`. Now it comes from `gPluginHost.getPermissionStringForTag(pluginTag);` where `pluginTag` ultimately comes from an id provided from the content process.

Yeah okay, the first thing I saw was me looking with my Fission "we shouldn't be getting principals from the content process" hat on; but now I see what this bug is really about; which is the arbitrary permission thing. This looks fixed to me.

> Harder to evaluate without permalinks in the first comment :)

Oops. Sorry for lack of permalink.

But yes, your analysis is correct here, this looks fixed to me. The issue of was the arbitrary permission string which is now replaced by selection from an allowlist in [PluginParent.jsm#540](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/38c88cbf4be87dfa0636d15a5d3599a8ea0d1a72/browser/actors/PluginParent.jsm#540)

I originally just tested this by modifying the permission name in the Browser Toolbox. Its completely changed now so my PoC code obviously no longer works. But to verify i did confirm that we are only sending limited data from child to parent now. The parent only receives data like:

```
{
  "plugin": {
    "id": 0,
    "fallbackType": 8
  },
  "showNow": true
}

```

For posterity, the original code should have permalinked in the first comment was [here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/68ac43af8f846949e46d80d62db1758344c36df6/browser/base/content/browser-plugins.js#46). IE the part where we take the permssion string from the msg.data object.

Are we OK with this fix riding the trains since [bug 1505913](/show_bug.cgi?id=1505913 "RESOLVED FIXED - [Fission] Make Plugin Click-to-Play Fission-aware") doesn't look like something we can easily backport?

Yep, this is not an urgent fix. The impact is probably limited to things that are already a problem until we implement Fission anyways.

The Mozilla developer docs say that:

"The HTTP Content-Security-Policy (CSP) script-src directive specifies valid sources for JavaScript. This includes not only URLs loaded directly into <script> elements, but also things like inline script event handlers (onclick) and XSLT stylesheets which can trigger script execution."

and:

"'none' Refers to the empty set; that is, no URLs match. The single quotes are required.", according to <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src>

These days while I was playing a CTF, I was able to trigger arbitrary javascript in the page's context using the <object> tag and could even steal user cookies.

This wasn't the CTF expected solution and shouldn't have worked because of the script-src 'none' policy ( doesn't work on chrome and other browsers).

So I made a PoC page and the working payload is: [http://38.240.18.75/csp/index.php?payload=<object](http://38.240.18.75/csp/index.php?payload=%EF%BF%BDobject) data="javascript:alert(`${document.cookie}`)"></object>

Code like: [http://38.240.18.75/csp/index.php?payload=<object](http://38.240.18.75/csp/index.php?payload=%EF%BF%BDobject) data="data:text/html,<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"></object>

executes in a different context and doesn't affect the web page, but maybe should be blocked as well by the CSP policy. In the attachments I'm disposing the webpage source and some prints of a working PoC.

I think this is a dupe of [bug 1457100](/show_bug.cgi?id=1457100 "VERIFIED FIXED - CSP: embedding resource's policy does not affect data: URL documents loaded via OBJECT elements"), which has comments suggesting [bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client") might be fixing this, but that's in 69 and [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1587976#c0 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP script-src 'none'; allows <object> to execute javascript code in firefox (but firefox developer edition works fines)") suggests that the exploit works there (ie it's still broken). It definitely seems fixed (exploit not working) in 70 beta for me. Christoph/Dan, can you confirm what's going on here?

By commenting out the patch in [Bug 1555043](/show_bug.cgi?id=1555043 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out interaction of CSP and javascript: URLs") I was able to reproduce this on 70; so I believe that patch fixed this in 70.

Within [Bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client") we moved the CSP from the Principal into the Client, a new Data Structure which better reflects the security context for CSP within Firefox. Besides the benefits of doing so it seems this refactoring effort has caused the regression reported within this Bug. At least [Bug 1555043](/show_bug.cgi?id=1555043 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out interaction of CSP and javascript: URLs") fixed the problem again to close that CSP bypass.

[testcase: default-src data:](attachment.cgi?id=9101462)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9101462&action=edit)

These two testcases can be used to test this bug and demonstrate the difference between this Fx69-only regression (the "none" case) and the less severe [bug 1441468](/show_bug.cgi?id=1441468 "VERIFIED FIXED - csp bypass using object tag") that is an older regression (the "data:" case).

I have confirmed that the "none" case does not affect ESR68 or ESR60, does affect Firefox 69, and is fixed in Firefox 70.

The older "data:" problem affects ESR60, ESR68, and Firefox 69, but is also fixed in Firefox 70 (by the same underlying fix, [bug 1555043](/show_bug.cgi?id=1555043 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out interaction of CSP and javascript: URLs")). Our behavior now matches Chrome on these cases.

Does not qualify for the bounty because we landed a fix before this was reported, and also because it was made public before we had a chance to deal with it. Please see our [bounty guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/).

| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Actual results:
in object tag , inline script runs and remote image loads , but in iframe tag ,CSP works fine
Expected results:
Ref: <https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#directive-img-src>
"This directive controls requests which load images. More formally, this includes requests whose type is "image" [FETCH]."
Ref: <https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#directive-script-src>
"The script-src directive restricts the locations from which scripts may be executed. This includes not only URLs loaded directly into script elements, but also things like inline script blocks and XSLT stylesheets [XSLT] which can trigger script execution."
object tag should behaves like iframe

This seems like a duplicate of [Bug 1441096](/show_bug.cgi?id=1441096 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Security: Content-Security-Policy confuses object-src with frame-src") to me. We don't inherit the CSP in that case which causes the CSP bypass. I don't know what we do special for object in that case though. Either way, I am pretty sure [Bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client") will fix the issue within this bug as well as [Bug 1441096](/show_bug.cgi?id=1441096 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Security: Content-Security-Policy confuses object-src with frame-src").Flags: needinfo?(ckerschb)

Within [Bug 965637](/show_bug.cgi?id=965637 "RESOLVED FIXED - Move CSP from nsIPrincipal into the Client") we moved the CSP from the Principal into the Client, but it was [Bug 1555043](/show_bug.cgi?id=1555043 "RESOLVED FIXED - Sort out interaction of CSP and javascript: URLs") after all that fixed the problem.

*This* bug is not that bad: we can live with it on ESR68 in my opinion. `<object>` tags with a `data:` URL do not inherit the parent's CSP as the spec says it should, but the content is contained in a unique-origin frame. Scripts should have been blocked, but even though they aren't they don't have access to any of the parent window's data (no XSS!). `data:` URLs have to be explicitly whitelisted in a site's CSP to work and that's not all that common.

~~We seem to have a slightly worse bug which *does* inherit the origin and works against a strong CSP of `default-src 'none'` that we might want to get into ESR 68.~~

Nevermind. That one is [bug 1587976](/show_bug.cgi?id=1587976 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP script-src 'none'; allows <object> to execute javascript code in firefox (but firefox developer edition works fines)") and does not affect ESR 68.

I am attempting to verify the fix of this issue, but I am not sure I understand the actual and expected results. Furthermore, I do not see any difference between the ESR68 v68.2.0esr build and the other builds (Release v70.0.1, Beta v72.0b1 and Nightly v73.0a1). The image is properly loaded on the left scrollable square, but no image is loaded in the right non-scrollable square.

@Christoph : Can you enlighten me so I can properly verify this fix? Thanks!

I think it's best to use this testcase:

<https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1587976#c8>

(FWIW, I'cced you on [Bug 1587976](/show_bug.cgi?id=1587976 "RESOLVED FIXED - CSP script-src 'none'; allows <object> to execute javascript code in firefox (but firefox developer edition works fines)") just in case you didn't have access to it).

Using an affected build (Nightly v70.0a1 from 2019-07-15) the test case will show a pop-up with the text "obj-javascript" and then show another pop-up with the text "[JavaScript Application] obj-data".

Using all the other main Firefox versions including ESR v68.3.0esr the pop-up will show the text "[JavaScript Application] obj-data".

The changeset pushed to mozilla-central is not found in the latest ESR build, however, it behaves like the unaffected ones.

Considering the fact that I do not know the actual and expected results, I will need someone to confirm that the verification is valid.

@Christoph: Can you confirm?

Freddy, since you also looked at this bug a while ago ([comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1441468#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - csp bypass using object tag")) I was wondering if you have better ways of testing to verify this problem has been fixed - do you?

Yeah, this is fixed as danibodea says in [comment 13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1441468#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - csp bypass using object tag").

There should be no other alert than "obj-data" for a fixed version of Firefox.
