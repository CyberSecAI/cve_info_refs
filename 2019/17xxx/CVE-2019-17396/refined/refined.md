The provided content describes a security vulnerability in the PowerSchool Mobile Android application. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application logs sensitive user credentials, specifically usernames and passwords, in the Android system's logcat during the login process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Logging:** The primary vulnerability is the insecure logging of sensitive data in logcat. This log is generally accessible to other applications on the device, especially on older Android versions.
- **Exposure of Credentials:**  Usernames and passwords, which are considered highly sensitive information, are exposed in cleartext within the logcat output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account Compromise:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts by extracting the username and password from the device's logs.
- **Data Breach:** Once an attacker has access, they could potentially access student records and other sensitive data within the PowerSchool system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access to Logcat:** An attacker needs local access to the device's logcat. This can be achieved in several ways:
    - If the attacker has an app installed on the same device, before Android Jelly Bean (API Level 16), the attacker can read the logs without any permission.
    - If the attacker has physical access to the device with USB debugging enabled.
    - If the device is rooted, an attacker can gain root privileges and access logcat through the terminal.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Device:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the Android device where the PowerSchool Mobile app is installed.
- **Ability to Read Logs:** The attacker needs the ability to read the system logs (logcat), which can be achieved through:
   -  Having an app installed on the device (prior to Jelly Bean).
   -  Having USB debugging enabled
   - Root access

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was tested on Android 8.
- The vulnerable application version is 1.1.8
- The reported PoC demonstrates how to use `adb logcat` to grep for the password and shows the actual log output that contains username and password.
- The report indicates that the vendor was notified and planned to fix the issue.
