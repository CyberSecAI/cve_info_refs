The provided content contains information about **CVE-2019-17250**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a user mode write access violation in the `WSQ!ReadWSQ` function within the `Wsq.dll` plugin.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- User mode write access violation. Specifically, the code attempts to write to memory location pointed to by `edi` which results in an access violation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption can be controlled by a malicious actor.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted WSQ file is opened in IrfanView.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious WSQ file and have the user open it with the vulnerable IrfanView version. This is a local attack vector, meaning that the attacker needs to get the file on the target system and convince a user to open it.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific instruction causing the issue is: `mov dword ptr [edi],edx`.
- The vulnerability is located at offset `0x42f5` within the `WSQ!ReadWSQ` function.
- Affected plugin: `Wsq.dll`.
- Affected IrfanView version: 4.53
