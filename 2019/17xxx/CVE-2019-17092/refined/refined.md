{
  "CVE-2019-17092": {
    "Root cause": "The project list of OpenProject lacks input validation on the 'sortBy' URL parameter. Error messages mishandle the parameter value, allowing arbitrary web script or HTML injection.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML, leading to malicious actions such as CSRF token extraction and API key creation.",
    "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with the 'sortBy' parameter containing a script tag that sources a JavaScript file (previously uploaded as an attachment).",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and also upload a malicious Javascript file as an attachment to a project. The user also needs to be logged in to the application."
