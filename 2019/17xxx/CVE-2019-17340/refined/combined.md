<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html>

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.5.final+shim4.10.4-1+deb9u12. Note that this will be the
last security update for Xen in the oldstable distribution; upstream
support for the 4.8.x branch ended by the end of December 2019. If you
rely on security support for your Xen installation an update to the
stable distribution (buster) is recommended.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.3+24-g14b62ab3e5-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 284 v3 (CVE-2019-17340) - grant table
 transfer issues on large hosts

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17340 / XSA-284
                              version 3

              grant table transfer issues on large hosts

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

When the code processing grant table transfer requests finds a page with
an address too large to be represented in the interface with the guest,
it allocates a replacement page and copies page contents.  However, the
code doing so fails to set the newly allocated page's accounting
properties correctly, resulting in the page becoming not only unusable
by the target domain, but also unfreeable upon domain cleanup.  The page
as well as certain other remnants of an affected guest will be leaked.

Furthermore internal state of the processing code was also not updated
correctly, resulting in the insertion of an IOMMU mapping to the page
being replaced (and subsequently freed), allowing the domain access to
memory it does not own.

IMPACT
======

The primary impact is a memory leak.  Malicious or buggy guests with
passed through PCI devices may also be able to escalate their
privileges, crash the host, or access data belonging to other guests.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions from at least 3.2 onwards are vulnerable.

64-bit x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability on hosts with
physical memory extending past the 16 TiB boundary.  This is only
possible for hypervisors built with CONFIG_BIGMEM enabled.

32-bit x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability on hosts with
physical memory extending past the 168 GiB boundary.

x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability on libxl
based systems.  On xend based systems x86 HVM guests can leverage
the vulnerability if their guest config file has a
'machine_address_size' setting.

ARM systems are not vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Running only x86 HVM/PVH guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Jan Beulich of SUSE.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
