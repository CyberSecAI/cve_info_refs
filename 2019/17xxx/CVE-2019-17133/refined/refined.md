## Analysis of CVE-2019-17133

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17133:

**Description:**

CVE-2019-17133 is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `cfg80211_mgd_wext_giwessid` function within `net/wireless/wext-sme.c` in the Linux kernel.  This function is part of the `cfg80211` subsystem, which handles wireless configuration.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability occurs because the `cfg80211_mgd_wext_giwessid` function doesn't properly validate the length of the SSID (Service Set Identifier) before copying it.  If a Wi-Fi network presents an SSID longer than the maximum expected size, a buffer overflow can occur during the `memcpy` operation, corrupting kernel memory.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Weakness:** Improper bounds checking
*   **Vulnerability:** Buffer Overflow

**Impact:**

*   A successful exploit could lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** System crash due to memory corruption.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Possible escalation of privileges by corrupting kernel stack memory.
    *   **Information Exposure:** Incomplete Spectre-RSB mitigation can lead to information exposure

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A malicious Wi-Fi access point (AP) could broadcast a beacon frame containing a long SSID.
*   A malicious P2P peer could send a malformed P2P information element.
*   An attacker could trick or coerce a system into joining a Wi-Fi network with an SSID longer than the standard.

**Attacker Capabilities:**

*   Physically proximate attacker is required.
*   Ability to trick or coerce a system to join a malicious Wi-Fi network.
*   Ability to broadcast a malicious beacon frame.

**Affected Systems:**

*   Systems using the `cfg80211` wireless subsystem, particularly those using drivers that do not perform their own SSID validation.
*   Specifically, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, Red Hat Enterprise MRG 2, SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop 12 SP4, 15, SUSE Linux Enterprise High Performance Computing 12 SP5, 15, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP4, 12 SP2, 12 SP3, 12 SP4, 12 SP5, 15, SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time 12 SP4 and other Linux distributions are affected.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability can be mitigated by applying the patch that bounds-checks the SSID element prior to invoking memcpy(). The patch ensures that SSID length is not greater than `IW_ESSID_MAX_SIZE`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a length check before the `memcpy` to ensure that the SSID length does not exceed `IW_ESSID_MAX_SIZE`.
*   The patch was backported to multiple Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions.
*   The SUSE information indicates that this issue is resolved in multiple SUSE Linux Enterprise products by updating the kernel.
*   The Debian information confirms the same vulnerability and resolution.
