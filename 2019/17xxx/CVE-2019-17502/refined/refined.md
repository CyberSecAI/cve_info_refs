Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-17502

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the Hydra web server when processing POST requests.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when a POST request lacks a `Content-Length` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked NULL Pointer:** The `process_header_end()` function in Hydra calls `boa_atoi()` with `req->content_length` as an argument. If the `Content-Length` header is missing in the POST request, `req->content_length` remains NULL.
- **Null Pointer Dereference:** `boa_atoi()` ultimately calls `atoi()` on this NULL pointer, causing a segmentation fault.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The server does not properly validate if the `Content-Length` header is present before attempting to convert its value to an integer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The NULL pointer dereference leads to a segmentation fault and crashes the Hydra daemon, making the web server unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Sending a specially crafted POST request lacking a `Content-Length` header to the server.
- **Remote or Local:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely if the server is accessible over a network or locally if the web server is only visible on the local network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges.
- The attacker needs to know an accessible URL path on the webserver.

**Additional Details:**
- Hydra v0.1.8 is a modification of the Boa web server and is commonly found in embedded networking equipment.
- The vulnerable code is located in `request.c`, `read.c`, and `util.c`, which all contribute to the issue.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `process_header_end()` function, specifically the additional code added by Hydra, where it makes the call to `boa_atoi()`.
- A proof of concept is provided using `curl` to send a POST request without a `Content-Length` header.
- The vulnerable code was present in 2006 and the project is no longer maintained.
