Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-17513

**Description:**

This CVE relates to an HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability in Ratpack versions 0.9.1 through 1.7.4.  The vulnerability occurs when untrusted and unsanitized data is used to populate HTTP response headers. An attacker can inject carriage return and line feed characters (CRLF) into header values, leading to the server issuing arbitrary HTTP responses specified by the attacker.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause was due to using the netty `DefaultHttpHeaders` object with verification disabled.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**

*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of validation and sanitization of user-supplied input used in HTTP response headers, allowing the injection of CRLF characters.
*   The usage of `DefaultHttpHeaders` with verification disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-User Defacement:** An attacker can modify the content presented to users.
*   **Cache Poisoning:** The attacker can manipulate cached responses, leading to long-term defacement and/or delivery of malicious content.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting a crafted response with JavaScript, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the user's browser.
*   **Page Hijacking:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites by manipulating the response.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request with Malicious Header Values:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the server, including the malicious CRLF sequences within the parameters for the header values.
*   **Direct Injection:** If the application allows direct manipulation of headers via an interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence or control values that are used to construct the HTTP response headers.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Vulnerable versions**: Ratpack versions 0.9.1 through 1.7.4 are vulnerable.
*  **Patched versions**: The vulnerability has been patched in Ratpack version 1.7.5.
*   The fix involved enabling HTTP header validation by instantiating `DefaultHttpHeaders` without the verification disabled.
*   The vulnerability is now documented in the Netty documentation.
*   A workaround for the vulnerability is to avoid using arbitrary input as response header values, or validate such values to remove CRLF characters before they are used.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jonathan Leitschuh.
* The provided code example demonstrates how a user supplied query parameter could be injected into a response header.
