            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17344 / XSA-290
                              version 3

         missing preemption in x86 PV page table unvalidation

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

XSA-273 changes required, among other things, making any PTE updates
restartable.  The changes making PTE updates restartable assumed that L2
pagetables would always be promoted preemptibly; but this turns out not
to be the case when using the 'linear pagetable' feature; the result was
that interrupted operations are not handled properly in certain cases.

Furthermore, previous security work making pagetable update preemptible
failed to account for 'linear pagetables' at L3 and L4 levels, making it
possible for operations to run for longer than acceptable times.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service
(DoS) attack affecting the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.

Only Xen versions which permit linear page table use by PV guests are
vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can leverage this vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests
cannot leverage this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not permitting linear page table use by PV guests avoids the
vulnerability.  This can be done both at build time, by turning off the
PV_LINEAR_PT configure option, or at runtime, by passing specifying
"pv-linear-pt=0" on the hypervisor command line.  Doing so would,
however, render PV guests using the functionality, like NetBSD,
unusable.

On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than
guest administrator, running only kernels which only issue sane
hypercalls will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this
issue.  However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it
unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into
the kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other
mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Manuel Bouyer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate pair of attached patches resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or the HVM-only as well as host controlled
kernel mitigations described above (or others which are substantially
similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems
with untrusted guest users and administrators.

HOWEVER deployment of the "pv-linear-pt=0" mitigation described above is
NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are
administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen
Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment
on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.

This is because in that case the configuration change is visible to the
guest, which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor, which
could result in denial of service, guest-to-host privilege escalation or
information leaks.

In addition this update provides mitigations for the "TSX Asynchronous Abort"
speculative side channel attack. For additional information please refer to
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html>

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.5.final+shim4.10.4-1+deb9u12. Note that this will be the
last security update for Xen in the oldstable distribution; upstream
support for the 4.8.x branch ended by the end of December 2019. If you
rely on security support for your Xen installation an update to the
stable distribution (buster) is recommended.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.3+24-g14b62ab3e5-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

Subject: Xen Security Advisory 290 v3 (CVE-2019-17344) - missing
 preemption in x86 PV page table unvalidation

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17344 / XSA-290
                              version 3

         missing preemption in x86 PV page table unvalidation

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

XSA-273 changes required, among other things, making any PTE updates
restartable.  The changes making PTE updates restartable assumed that L2
pagetables would always be promoted preemptibly; but this turns out not
to be the case when using the 'linear pagetable' feature; the result was
that interrupted operations are not handled properly in certain cases.

Furthermore, previous security work making pagetable update preemptible
failed to account for 'linear pagetables' at L3 and L4 levels, making it
possible for operations to run for longer than acceptable times.

IMPACT
======

Malicious or buggy x86 PV guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service
(DoS) attack affecting the whole system.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

All Xen versions are vulnerable.

Only x86 systems are affected.  ARM systems are not affected.

Only Xen versions which permit linear page table use by PV guests are
vulnerable.

Only x86 PV guests can leverage this vulnerability.  x86 HVM guests
cannot leverage this vulnerability.

MITIGATION
==========

Not permitting linear page table use by PV guests avoids the
vulnerability.  This can be done both at build time, by turning off the
PV_LINEAR_PT configure option, or at runtime, by passing specifying
"pv-linear-pt=0" on the hypervisor command line.  Doing so would,
however, render PV guests using the functionality, like NetBSD,
unusable.

On systems where the guest kernel is controlled by the host rather than
guest administrator, running only kernels which only issue sane
hypercalls will prevent untrusted guest users from exploiting this
issue.  However untrusted guest administrators can still trigger it
unless further steps are taken to prevent them from loading code into
the kernel (e.g by disabling loadable modules etc) or from using other
mechanisms which allow them to run code at kernel privilege.

Running only HVM guests will avoid this vulnerability.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Manuel Bouyer.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or the HVM-only as well as host controlled
kernel mitigations described above (or others which are substantially
similar) is permitted during the embargo, even on public-facing systems
with untrusted guest users and administrators.

HOWEVER deployment of the "pv-linear-pt=0" mitigation described above is
NOT permitted (except where all the affected systems and VMs are
administered and used only by organisations which are members of the Xen
Project Security Issues Predisclosure List).  Specifically, deployment
on public cloud systems is NOT permitted.

This is because in that case the configuration change is visible to the
guest, which could lead to the rediscovery of the vulnerability.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor, which
could result in denial of service, guest-to-host privilege escalation or
information leaks.

In addition this update provides mitigations for the "TSX Asynchronous Abort"
speculative side channel attack. For additional information please refer to
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html>

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.5.final+shim4.10.4-1+deb9u12. Note that this will be the
last security update for Xen in the oldstable distribution; upstream
support for the 4.8.x branch ended by the end of December 2019. If you
rely on security support for your Xen installation an update to the
stable distribution (buster) is recommended.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.3+24-g14b62ab3e5-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>
