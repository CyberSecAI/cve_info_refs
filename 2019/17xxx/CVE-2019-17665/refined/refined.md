- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ghidra application loads the `jansi.dll` library from the working directory instead of its intended location within the application's installation directory. This behavior allows for DLL hijacking.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL Hijacking vulnerability. The application's failure to correctly specify the path for loading `jansi.dll` allows a malicious DLL with the same name placed in the working directory to be loaded instead of the legitimate one.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution. When a malicious `jansi.dll` is loaded, the code contained in the malicious library is executed within the context of the Ghidra application process, potentially leading to complete system compromise. The provided example demonstrates execution of `calc.exe` as a proof of concept.

- **Attack vectors:**
    1. An attacker places a malicious `jansi.dll` file in the working directory where Ghidra is launched.
    2. The user launches Ghidra from this directory, either by direct execution or via a contextual menu using a project file located in this directory.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    1. The attacker needs to have the capability to write a malicious DLL file.
    2. The attacker must be able to place the malicious DLL (`jansi.dll`) in a location where Ghidra is executed (working directory).
    3. The attacker could also get the user to open a Ghidra project located in a malicious directory.
