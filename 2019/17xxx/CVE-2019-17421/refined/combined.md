* If you are trying to apply more than one service pack at a time, you need to restart the Firewall Analyzer Server after applying each service pack and check whether your data is intact in the web client. If you don't have any issues, follow the above steps for applying the other service pack. If you find any issues, do not continue applying the other service pack and contact [Firewall Analyzer Support](/products/firewall/support.html).
* If Firewall Analyzer has been installed as a root user in a Linux machine, continue with the below procedure logged in as a root user itself.
* Pre-requisite for context based Cisco Firewalls (Virtual Firewall): The Cisco Firewall IP address should be DNS resolvable from the Firewall Analyzer.
## Procedure to apply the service pack (for both Windows and Linux)

Follow the instructions below to upgrade Firewall Analyzer:

**Note**: To take a backup is essential to revert to the existing build without any loss of data if the upgrade fails due to unexpected reasons.

**Step 1**: Shut down Firewall Analyzer. (If Firewall Analyzer is running as a service, stop the service also)

**Step 2**: Take a backup of the entire *Data* folder from the installed directory to a safe location.

* Take the backup for complete *Firewall\_Home* folder as backup.
* Follow the steps to upgrade Firewall Analyzer.

**MSSQL Database**:

* Take the backup for complete *Firewall\_Home* folder as backup.
* Take the backup for the firewall database in MSSQL server using SQL Server Management Studio. Please refer the link to take the backup in MSSQL.
* Proceed with the upgrade steps.

**For Firewall Analyzer Enterprise Edition**:

* Stop the Firewall Analyzer **Central** and **Collector** Service.
* Take the backup for complete *Firewall\_Home* folder as backup in both **Central** and **Collector** server.
* Proceed with the upgrade steps in Central server first.
* Once upgrade is completed in **Central** server, proceed with the upgrade steps in Collector server.

**Step 3**: Execute the **UpdateManager.bat (.sh in case of Linux)** file present in the **/bin** directory.
