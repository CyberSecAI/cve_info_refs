Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox handles drag-and-drop operations involving resources that are not valid images but are treated as such. Specifically, when a cross-origin resource that fails to load correctly as an image is dragged and dropped, Firefox incorrectly provides the content of the resource as if it were a valid image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Content Type Handling:** Firefox fails to properly validate if a resource is a valid image during drag-and-drop operations.
- **Cross-Origin Information Leak:** This leads to a cross-origin information leak, allowing the content of a resource from a different origin to be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially:

-   **Read Cross-Origin Resources:** By dragging and dropping a resource (incorrectly treated as an image) from a different origin to a controlled page, the attacker can obtain the content of the resource. This could include sensitive information if the resource requires authentication (e.g., profile pages).

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is triggered via a drag and drop operation of an object from one origin to another.
- A specially crafted web page can trigger the vulnerability by initiating a drag operation involving a resource that is not a valid image.
- Closing the origin window during the drag operation is a key part of triggering the vulnerability.
- Dropping the "image" (the resource) onto a cross-origin document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Serve Malicious Content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve a webpage that initiates the drag operation.
-   **User Interaction:** The attacker requires the user to perform a drag and drop action of a specific object onto a page they control.
- **Firefox browser**: The vulnerability is specific to the Firefox browser.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is more easily reproducible on Windows. It is not reproducible on macOS.
- The vulnerability is triggered when dragging an image from a closed popup. This is because, when a popup is closed, Firefox handles the drag and drop differently.
- When dragging a valid image, Firefox generally provides only the URL of the image and not the image's data. However, in this scenario, a File object containing the contents of the resource is exposed.
- The fix involved moving a security check into a utility function, ensuring that the check applies to both copy and drag/drop support.
- The original PoC relied on the ability to programmatically navigate/open a data:text/html URL, which has been disabled. The PoC has been updated to use blob: URLs.
