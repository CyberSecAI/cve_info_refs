CVE-2019-17341:
  - Root cause: When adding a passed-through PCI device to a domain after it was already started, IOMMU page tables may need constructing on the fly. For PV guests, the decision of whether a page ought to have a mapping is based on whether the page is writable. Writability of a page may change at any time, and failure to respect this possible race may lead to IOMMU mappings of page tables, allowing the guest to alter such page tables without Xen auditing the changes.
  - Vulnerabilities present: Race condition leading to unauthorized IOMMU mappings.
  - Impact of exploitation: Malicious PV guests can escalate their privilege to that of the hypervisor.
  - Attack vector: Exploiting the race condition when adding a passed-through PCI device to a running PV guest.
  - Required attacker capabilities: A malicious PV guest with the ability to have a PCI device assigned after domain creation.
