  "CVE-2019-17041": {
    "Description": "A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the AIX message parser within rsyslog. The parser attempts to locate a log message delimiter (space or colon) but fails to handle strings that do not meet this constraint. When such strings are encountered, the variable `lenMsg` can reach zero, bypassing a sanity check intended to detect invalid messages. The parser then processes the message as valid, attempting to 'eat' the non-existent colon delimiter. This process decrements `lenMsg` to -1. Subsequently, a left shift operation is performed using memmove based on the now invalid `lenMsg` resulting in a heap overflow due to the misinterpretation of the signed integer as a large positive value.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause of this vulnerability is the improper handling of log messages lacking a specific delimiter (colon or space) within the AIX log message parser in rsyslog. This leads to a signed integer overflow when `lenMsg` is decremented from zero, causing it to wrap around to a large positive number. Subsequent memory operations use this flawed length, triggering a heap overflow.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap overflow",
         "Unsafe memory operation (memmove)"
    ],
    "Impact": "A heap overflow can lead to a crash of the rsyslog service, potentially causing denial of service. It could also be exploited to execute arbitrary code, leading to remote code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can send specially crafted log messages lacking the expected delimiter to a vulnerable rsyslog instance. If the rsyslog instance is configured to process AIX logs, the flawed parser will be invoked, triggering the heap overflow.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to send log messages to the targeted rsyslog instance. They would also need to be aware of the specific structure needed to trigger the vulnerability."
