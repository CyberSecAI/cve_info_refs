Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17119:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of user-supplied input within the `Logs.jsp` page of WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server. Specifically, the `source` and `substring` parameters are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which arises from the unsanitized `source` and `substring` parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary database interaction: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary SQL queries, which can include creating, reading, updating, or deleting data in the database.
- Data exfiltration: Attackers could potentially extract sensitive data.
- Denial of service: Attackers could use stacked queries, such as `select pg_sleep(5)`, to cause delays and potentially disrupt the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP POST requests to the `/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp` endpoint, using the vulnerable `source` and `subString` parameters.
- Stacked queries: The application uses Postgres which supports stacked queries, allowing for more complex attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server.
- Network access: The attacker must have network access to the server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippets from `Logs.jsp`:

```java
private String createSourceFilter(HttpServletRequest request) {
    String source = getLogConfig(request).get("source");
    if (source == null || "None".equals(source)) {
        return " ";
    }
    return " and logger_name = '" + source + "' ";
}

private String createSubStringFilter(HttpServletRequest request) {
    String subString = getLogConfig(request).get("subString");
    if (subString == null || subString.trim().length() == 0) {
        return " ";
    }
    return " and rendered_message like '%" + subString + "%' ";
}
```

The provided information includes the following example exploits to confirm the vulnerability:

```
time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE" --data-binary "source='; select pg_sleep(5);--" https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp

time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE" --data-binary "subString='; select pg_sleep(5);--" https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp
```
The `pg_sleep(5)` function is used to introduce a delay, demonstrating that the injected SQL is indeed being executed.

The `seclists.org` content provides additional context, stating:
> *Logs.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *substring *and *source* parameters.
> The following request will demonstrate the issue:
> ```
> time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE" --data-binary "source='; select pg_sleep(5);--" <https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp>
> ```
