**Summary of extracted information for CVE-2019-17055:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `base_sock_create` function in `drivers/isdn/mISDN/socket.c` lacks a check for `CAP_NET_RAW` capability before creating a raw socket.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Missing privilege check for raw socket creation in the AF_ISDN network module.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unprivileged user can create a raw AF_ISDN socket, which could potentially enable them to bypass network restrictions or control the availability of ISDN circuits.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access via any unprivileged user on the system.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An unprivileged user with local system access.
*   **Additional Notes:** This vulnerability is specifically related to the mISDN driver and AF\_ISDN network protocol in the Linux kernel. Patches generally involve adding a privilege check for CAP_NET_RAW before allocating raw sockets.

Based on the information above, here's the response:

```
Root cause of vulnerability: The `base_sock_create` function in `drivers/isdn/mISDN/socket.c` within the Linux kernel's AF_ISDN network module does not enforce the `CAP_NET_RAW` capability when creating a raw socket.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Missing privilege check for raw socket creation.

Impact of exploitation: Unprivileged users can create raw AF_ISDN sockets, potentially allowing them to bypass intended restrictions on low-level network access or control the availability of ISDN circuits.

Attack vectors: Locally, any unprivileged user could create a raw AF_ISDN socket.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An unprivileged user with local access to the system is sufficient.
