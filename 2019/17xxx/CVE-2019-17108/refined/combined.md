Subject: Re: Multiple vulnerabilities in Centreon-Web and Centreon-VM

Hello,

My advisory posted yesterday contains a problematic typo: CVE-2019-17017 should have been written CVE-2019-17107. Sorry for the inconvenience it may have caused.

Here is the corrected context:
> High impact

Original advisory follows.
