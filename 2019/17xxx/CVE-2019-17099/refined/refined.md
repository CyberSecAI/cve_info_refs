CVE-2019-17099:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Untrusted Search Path vulnerability in EPSecurityService.exe. The application loads DLL files from the search path in an insecure manner.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Insecure DLL loading.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can load an arbitrary DLL file.
- Attack vectors: Exploitation occurs by placing a malicious DLL in a directory that is part of the search path, which will then be loaded by EPSecurityService.exe.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the privileges to place a malicious DLL in a location that EPSecurityService.exe searches. The attacker requires high privileges and user interaction.
