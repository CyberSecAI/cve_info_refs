    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a double release of a ByteBuffer in Jetty when handling too-large response headers. This leads to potential information disclosure when another thread uses the same ByteBuffer to write different data, which is then sent to the initial client.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause is a double release of a `ByteBuffer` back into the `ByteBufferPool` in Jetty. This occurs when an exception is thrown to produce an HTTP 431 error in response to oversized response headers.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "CWE-672: Operation on a Resource after Expiration or Release",
        "CWE-675: Duplicate Operations on Resource"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability results in potential information disclosure. A client might receive responses or data that were meant for another client, possibly containing sensitive information like HTTP session IDs or authentication credentials.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered by sending large response headers to the server.",
        "The specific protocol mentioned is HTTP. Secure variants like HTTPS are also affected"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated attacker can trigger this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable server.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in Jetty versions 9.4.27.v20200227 to 9.4.29.v20200521. Upgrading to Jetty 9.4.30.v20200611 or later fixes the vulnerability. A workaround is to configure a `responseHeaderSize` significantly larger than `requestHeaderSize`, i.e. (12KB responseHeaderSize and 8KB requestHeaderSize)."
