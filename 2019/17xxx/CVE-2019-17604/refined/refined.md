{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application allows modification of candidate profiles by directly referencing candidate IDs in the request parameters without proper authorization checks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can change other candidates' personal information, including first name, last name, email, CV, phone number, and all other personal information.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker registers as a candidate, then sends a crafted POST request to `/candidates/profile` with a modified `id` parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be a registered candidate within the application."
