{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the processing of the request body in the `phpcgi_main()` function, specifically how it parses URL parameters. By crafting a malicious HTTP request, it's possible to bypass authentication and access sensitive PHP files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of URL parameters",
      "Bypass of authentication mechanism",
	    "Lack of proper authorization checks",
      "Information disclosure vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as VPN configurations stored in `vpnconfig.php`.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted HTTP requests targeting the `phpcgi_main()` function. Specifically, by adding a `%0a` character after a `pwnd` parameter in the URL.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface via LAN or WAN."
