Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2019-17206:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the uncontrolled deserialization of a pickled object within the `models.py` file of the `rediswrapper` library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Deserialization:** The application deserializes data from a Redis storage without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious pickled objects.
- **Code Execution:** By exploiting the deserialization flaw, the attacker can execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts on the server where `rediswrapper` is used.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Pickle Payload Injection:** The attacker stores a malicious pickle payload within the Redis storage, disguised as a simple bytes object.
- **Retrieval Trigger:** When the application retrieves and deserializes the malicious pickled object, the injected code is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to write to the Redis storage used by the `rediswrapper` library.
- The attacker must be able to trigger the retrieval of the stored malicious pickle payload by the application.
- No specific network position is mentioned.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates how an attacker can store a malicious pickle payload and then trigger its execution via the `storage['element']` retrieval.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.3.0 of `rediswrapper`.
- The fix was introduced in commit `2751f6ff86e3f90c9e14b8b8acc8ef02c86987e1`, as part of pull request #1, and included a change to the test cases (`f24212589b568c9f9ae11d4bf504f42303b341d5`).
