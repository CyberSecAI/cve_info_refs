Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an unquoted service path in the FortiTray component of FortiClient for Windows. This means the path to the FortiClientConsole executable, which is used by a service, was not enclosed in quotation marks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Unquoted Service Path:** The core issue is the lack of quotation marks around the service executable's path. This allows for a potential "binary planting" attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local System:** The attack would likely need to be executed from the local system where FortiClient is installed.
- **Binary Planting:** An attacker could exploit the lack of quotes by placing a malicious executable with the same name as a part of the service's path in a higher-priority directory. The Windows service loader will attempt to load and execute the malicious binary rather than the intended one during service start up.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker requires local access to the system where the vulnerable FortiClient version is installed.
- **File System Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to write to the file system and place a malicious executable at an earlier path location compared to where the original executable exists.

**Additional Details**

- The vulnerability affects FortiClient for Windows versions 6.2.2 and below.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 6.2.3 or higher where the service path is properly quoted.
- The vulnerability was reported by Michael Wollner from Deutsche Telekom AG.
