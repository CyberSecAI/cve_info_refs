{
    "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The CoAP parser in `sn_coap_parser.c` lacks proper bounds checking while parsing options and payload, leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Buffer overflow due to insufficient bounds checking during option and payload parsing.",
            "Lack of validation on option lengths and option numbers.",
            "Unchecked pointer arithmetic and dereferencing."

        "impact": "Memory corruption, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Maliciously crafted CoAP packets with oversized options or payloads can trigger the vulnerability."
        ],
