CVE-2020-14002

  PuTTY had an Observable Discrepancy leading to an
  information leak in the algorithm negotiation.
  This allowed man-in-the-middle attackers to target
  initial connection attempts (where no host key for the
  server has been cached by the client).

CVE-2021-36367

  PuTTY proceeded with establishing an SSH session even
  if it has never sent a substantive authentication response.
  This made it easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server
  to present a later spoofed authentication prompt (that the
  attacker can use to capture credential data, and use that
  data for purposes that are undesired by the client user).

CVE-2023-48795

   PuTTY was vulnerable to Terrapin attack.  The SSH transport
   protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, allowed remote attackers
   to bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from
   the extension negotiation message), and a client and server may
   consequently end up with a connection for which some security
   features have been downgraded or disabled. This occurs because the
   SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these extensions,
   mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of sequence
   numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against SSH's
   use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The
   bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305 and (if CBC is used)
   the -etm MAC algorithms.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
0.74-1+deb11u1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your putty packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1152753#c0)  Robert Frohl   2019-10-02 07:52:05 UTC  ``` These features are new in 0.73 (released 2019-09-29):      Security fix: on Windows, other applications were able to bind to the same TCP port as a PuTTY local port forwarding. (CVE-2019-17067)     Security fix: in bracketed paste mode, the terminal escape sequences that should delimit the pasted data were appearing together on one side of it, making it possible to misidentify pasted data as manual keyboard input. (CVE-2019-17068)     Bug fix (possibly security-related): an SSH-1 server sending a disconnection message could cause an access to freed memory. (CVE-2019-17069)     Bug fix: Windows Plink would crash on startup if it was acting as a connection-sharing downstream.     Bug fix: Windows PuTTY now updates its terminal window size correctly if the screen resolution changes while it's maximised.     Bug fix: tweaked terminal handling to prevent lost characters at the ends of lines in gcc's coloured error messages.     Bug fix: removed a bad interaction between the 'clear scrollback' operation and mouse selection that could give rise to the dreaded "line==NULL" assertion box.    <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/changes.html> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1152753#c1)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-10-02 08:40:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1152753) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/734493> 15.0 / putty <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/734494> 15.1 / putty ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1152753#c2)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-10-07 16:12:45 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:2277-1: An update that fixes two vulnerabilities is now available.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

PuTTY version 0.73 is released
------------------------------

All the pre-built binaries, and the source code, are now available
from the PuTTY website at

    <https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/>

This is a SECURITY UPDATE, fixing minor vulnerabilities affecting port
forwarding on Windows; bracketed paste mode in the terminal; and any
use of SSH-1. We recommend that anyone using those features should
update.

Vulnerabilities fixed in this release include:

 - On Windows, the listening sockets used for local port forwarding
   were opened in a mode that did not prevent other processes from
   also listening on the same ports and stealing some of the incoming
   connections.

 - In the PuTTY terminal, bracketed paste mode was broken in 0.72, in
   a way that made the pasted data look like manual keyboard input. So
   any application relying on the bracketing sequences to protect
   against malicious clipboard contents would have been misled.

 - An SSH-1 server could trigger an access to freed memory by sending
   the SSH1_MSG_DISCONNECT message. Not known to be exploitable.

Other bug fixes include:

 - Windows Plink no longer crashes on startup when it tries to tell
   you it's reusing an existing SSH connection.

 - Windows PuTTY now updates its terminal window size correctly if the
   screen resolution changes while it's maximised.

 - If you display the coloured error messages from gcc in the PuTTY
   terminal, there is no longer a missing character if a colour change
   happens exactly at the end of a line.

 - If you use the 'Clear Scrollback' menu option or escape sequence
   while text in the scrollback is selected, it no longer causes an
   assertion failure.

Enjoy using PuTTY!

Cheers,
Simon
