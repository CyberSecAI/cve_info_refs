The provided content relates to CVE-2019-17446.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Eracent EPA Agent, when installed for non-root operations, was vulnerable due to an Untrusted Search Path. The agent executable could be exploited to start external programs with elevated permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Untrusted Search Path: The agent executable did not properly sanitize the PATH variable, allowing an attacker to influence the execution path of external programs started by the agent.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- File content exposure
- File corruption
- Denial-of-service

**Attack vectors:**
- Local login to a non-privileged account on a Linux system where the vulnerable agent is installed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to a non-privileged user account on a Linux system with a vulnerable Eracent EPA Agent installed.
- The Linux agent needs to be running in non-root mode.
