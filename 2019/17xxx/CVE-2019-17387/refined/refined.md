Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17387:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Aviatrix VPN client's service (AVPNC_RP) handles the `connect_openvpn` operation. Specifically, the `func_connect_openvpn` method constructs a command to execute `openvpn`, and it improperly sanitizes the `conffile_` and `tempfile_` arguments received in a POST request to the service. While the values are quoted using `shellescape`, the command is executed using Popen, which interprets shell metacharacters even inside quotes. This allows for command injection when the client sends a request to the local service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input (`conffile_`, `tempfile_`) before constructing the openvpn command. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by including shell metacharacters such as `$(command)` within the arguments sent via POST request.
*   **Insecure local service**: The local service listens on port 5006 on 127.0.0.1 for commands. This may have been intended for internal use within the application, but was found to be a vulnerable attack surface.
*   **Certificate Authentication Bypass**: Although the service attempts to use certificate authentication, the client certificate and private key are accessible in the operating system's temporary directory or can be easily recreated because they are stored in the application's source code itself.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By exploiting the command injection vulnerability, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the AVPNC_RP service, which typically runs as root/SYSTEM on the affected systems.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who has gained initial access to a system can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges to root/SYSTEM. This allows them to gain full control over the system, access sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability Impact**: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to completely compromise the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable service, which runs locally on port 5006. Therefore the attacker must have local access or be able to forward traffic to the local service.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a specifically crafted JSON payload to the local service using a POST request. The payload includes the `connect_openvpn` operation and injected shell commands within the `args` parameter, bypassing certificate authentication requirements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have some level of access to the target system (e.g., via user account or a previous exploit), or the ability to forward network traffic.
*   **Network communication**: The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the local service listening on 127.0.0.1:5006.
*   **Knowledge of JSON Format:** The attacker needs to understand the required JSON structure for the POST request, especially the format for the connect\_openvpn operation.
*   **Certificate Retrieval/Recreation:** The attacker needs to be able to access the client's certificate and private key, which are available in the temporary directory or can be recreated using information in the client's code.
