## Description

![@dalvarezperez](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/44669408?u=0486a8b1cdb8c9759425cfa3fba22e804bd7eac6&v=4&size=48)[dalvarezperez](https://github.com/dalvarezperez)opened [on Mar 7, 2019](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/107#issue-418556982)

**Describe the bug**

When executing Ghidra from a given path the Java process working directory is set to this path. Then, when launching Python interpreter located in "Ghidra Codebrowser" -> "Window" -> "Python"

Ghidra will try to execute an arbitrary file "cmd.exe" located at the attacker choosen working directory.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Copy an arbitrary Portable Executable file named "cmd.exe" into a folder, for instance: c:\test.
2. Open a command line and go to the choosen folder. Following the same example: cd c:\test\
3. Execute Ghidra from the command line: [route\_to\_ghidra]\ghidraRun.bat
4. Create a new Ghidra proyect.
5. Add a Portable Executable into the proyect.
6. Open the added file in "GhidraCodebrowser".
7. Go to "Window", and then to "Python".
8. Wait until your arbitrary file "cmd.exe" is executed.

**Expected behavior**

Ghidra would resolve the right "cmd.exe" located into the Windows system directory.
