### Who Is This Plugin For?

#### Car Dealers

Car dealers can use the Motors plugin to showcase their inventory online. By creating detailed listings with photos, videos, and descriptions, dealers can attract more buyers. For example, a car dealer can use the plugin to allow customers to request test drives directly from the listing page and many more. The plugin has features to post an unlimited number of car listings.

#### Dealerships

Dealerships can benefit from the Motors by managing multiple types of vehicles in one place. It makes selling items for vehicle dealers simple and fast. Whether they sell cars, motorcycles, boats, or trucks, Motors gives an opportunity to dealers to keep their listings effectively on WordPress sites. A dealership can set up categories for different vehicle types to help customers find what they’re looking for.

### Create a Listing with Ease

With the plugin, car dealers can add all the important details about the vehicle, like its make, model, year, and mileage. Plus, you can upload photos and videos to give buyers a good look at the vehicle from every angle.

You have the option to let the plugin come up with a title for you based on the vehicle’s details, or you can create your own to highlight its best features. The Motors plugin helps you fill in important info to your car listings on the WordPress site like the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), production date, and any history or maintenance records.

You can take it further by using premium pre-built page templates for each listing or creating your own custom layout using premium elements.

### Customize Listing Pages

The plugin allows you to choose how you want your car listings to appear, whether it’s in a grid or list format, to make it easier for buyers to browse through your WordPress site. You can also add buttons for test drives, loan calculators, and certification logos to help buyers make decisions faster.

The plugin lets you set options like registering users as vehicle dealers on your WordPress site. You can customize your site with the advanced features listed below:

– Search listings by location using Google Maps integration.

– Sort listings by custom fields—perfect for businesses that want to offer custom sorting options.

– Register users as Dealers or Dealerships, allowing multiple sellers to manage their own listings.

– Mark listings as Sold and display these listings with a “Sold” label, so customers can see the sold cars.

– Customize your URL structure for SEO-friendly listings for better search engine visibility.

– Display images with an image sliding gallery directly on the listing cards, offering a mini-preview for buyers.

– Use the built-in Loan Calculator to help buyers estimate financing directly from the listing page.

### Listing Management

The Motors plugin offers a wide range of management features:

– **User Management** – From user registration to profile management, the plugin gives access to both buyers and car dealers to an intuitive system of your WordPress site.

– **Listings Management** – Plugin lets you add, edit, and delete listings posted by vehicle dealers easily via the frontend submission form.

– **Comparing Listings** – Users can compare multiple vehicles side-by-side to help make informed decisions.

– **Category Management** – Create unlimited custom categories with parent-child dependencies, icons, and filters to ensure easy browsing.

– **Shortcodes** – Use shortcodes to integrate listing features into any page.

The Motors plugin also has an **Email Template Manager (Pro)** that lets you fully customize the emails sent out to maintain consistent messaging for customers and dealers on your WordPress site.

I recently started using the Motors WordPress Theme for a my brother’s car dealership website www.mmcarz.com.au , and I couldn’t be more impressed with the results. From its clean and modern layout to its intuitive navigation, this theme is a powerhouse for anyone looking to create a professional automotive website. Design and CustomizationThe design is not only visually appealing but also incredibly flexible. Whether you’re building a site for selling cars, renting vehicles, or showcasing inventory, the theme offers multiple pre-built templates that cater to different needs. Customizing the design was a breeze, even for someone with basic technical skills. The drag-and-drop Elementor integration made it simple to tweak layouts, and the wide range of color and typography options ensured I could perfectly align the theme with my brand. User Experience
The theme is extremely user-friendly, both for website visitors and the backend admin. The layout is thoughtfully designed, making it easy for customers to browse through listings, filter results, and contact the dealership directly. Features like advanced search and comparison tools. PerformanceSpeed is critical for any website, and Motors doesn’t disappoint. The theme loads quickly and performs well even with a large number of listings. The code is optimized for SEO, ensuring better visibility in search engines right out of the box. Pro VersionOne thing I liked about Motors is its stunning demos, so much so I bought a lifetime package before even starting using the starter theme. It was a no brainer.
Room for ImprovementWhile the Motors theme is fantastic overall, there are a few areas that could use improvement:
Bugs and glitches: I encountered some minor bugs, such as occasional misalignment of elements on mobile devices and issues with the advanced search functionality not saving filters properly.
Learning curve: Although the theme is user-friendly, the abundance of features can be a bit overwhelming for beginners. It took some time to fully understand how to configure certain advanced settings.
SupportA major highlight of using Motors is the excellent support team. A special shoutout to Chris Stones, whose responsiveness and expertise have been invaluable.
If you’re in the market for a robust, professional, and feature-packed WordPress theme for your car dealership, Motors is hands-down one of the best choices. While there is some room for improvement, the Pro version takes functionality to the next level, and the stellar support ensures you’re never left stranded. Overall, it’s a highly recommended investment for automotive websites.

# Multiple vulnerabilities in WordPress Motors Car Dealer & Classified Ads plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [September 20, 2019 - 7:35pm [+0700]October 7, 2019 - 1:27am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-wordpress-motors-car-dealer-classified-ads-plugin/)

The WordPress [Motors Car Dealer & Classified Ads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/motors-car-dealership-classified-listings/) plugin, which has 10,000+ active installations, was prone to multiple vulnerabilities in version 1.4.0 and below.

### Reference

CVE-2019-17228, CVE-2019-17229

### Unauthenticated settings import/export and stored XSS

In the “includes/options.php” script, the `stm_export_settings` function is registered via the `init` hook and thus is called whenever the blog is accessed:

```

function stm_export_settings()
{
    if (!empty($_GET['export_settings'])) {
        $options = get_option('stm_vehicle_listing_options');

        header('Content-disposition: attachment; filename=file.json');
        header('Content-type: application/json');
        echo json_encode($options);
        exit();
    }

    if (!empty($_FILES) && !empty($_FILES['import_settings']) && !empty($_FILES['import_settings']['tmp_name'])) {
        $json = json_decode(file_get_contents($_FILES['import_settings']['tmp_name']), true);
        if (!empty($json)) {
            update_option('stm_vehicle_listing_options', $json);
        }
    }

}

add_action('init', 'stm_export_settings');

```

The function is used to import and export the plugin options: it lacks capability check and a security nonce and therefore is accessible to anyone.

The imported options, which are displayed in the CMS back-end, are managed by the “includes/admin/categories.php” script. Its `stm_vehicles_listings_show_field` function is used to build the HTML form and to insert the imported values:

```

function stm_vehicles_listings_show_field($name, $settings, $values) {
   $type = 'stm_vehicle_listings_field_text';
   if(!empty($settings['type'])) {
      $type = 'stm_vehicle_listings_field_' . $settings['type'];
   }

   $type($name, $settings, $values);
}

```

It calls six different `stm_vehicle_listings_field_*` functions to build the HTML form elements (e.g., text, select, radio input fields) such as this one, `stm_vehicle_listings_field_text`:

```

function stm_vehicle_listings_field_text($name, $settings, $values) {
   $value = (!empty($values[$name])) ? $values[$name] : '';
   $atts = (!empty($settings['attributes'])) ? $settings['attributes'] : array();
   $input_atts = '';
   if(!empty($atts)) {
      foreach($atts as $key => $att) {
         $input_atts .= $key . '="' . $att . '" ';
      }
   }
   ?>
   <div class="stm_form_wrapper stm_form_wrapper_<?php echo $settings['type']; ?> stm_form_wrapper_<?php echo $name; ?> <?php stm_vehicles_listing_has_preview($settings); ?>" <?php stm_vehicles_listing_show_dependency($settings); ?>>
      <label>
         <span><?php echo $settings['label']; ?></span>
         <input <?php echo $input_atts; ?> type="<?php echo $settings['type'] ?>" name="<?php echo $name; ?>" value="<?php echo $value; ?>" />
      </label>
      <?php stm_vehicles_listings_preview($settings); ?>
   </div>
<?php }

```

None of the six functions validate or sanitize the imported values.

An unauthenticated user can export the plugin configuration, inject JavaScript or any other HTML code into one of the several vulnerable fields, and re-import the plugin options, which could lead to multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities in the back-end section of WordPress when the admin visits the plugin configuration page:

### Additional issues

Several additional security issues were found in Motors Car Dealer & Classified Ads.

#### 1. Authenticated settings import

The plugin allows the administrator to import an XML file from WebManager. All functions handling the imported data are located in the following two scripts:

* includes/automanager/xml-importer-automanager-ajax.php: The `stm_ajax_file_automanager_upload`, `stm_ajax_automanager_save_associations` and `stm_ajax_automanager_save_template` functions are accessible to any authenticated users via the WordPress AJAX API.
* includes/automanager/xml-importer-automanager-iframe.php: The `stmImportXML` function, which loads via the `admin_init` hook, is accessible to any unauthenticated users.

#### 2. Unsanitized inputs

The “templates/single-car/car-price.php” script is one of the templates used to display the users ads on the blog front-end. Lines 57, 71, 95, 104 and 121, the author misused the PHP `prinft` and WordPress [esc\_html\_\_](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/esc_html__/) functions. For instance:

```

<?php printf(esc_html__('%s', 'stm_vehicles_listing'), $regular_price_label); ?>

```

The problem with the above code is that only `%s` will be sanitized, not the content of the `$regular_price_label` variable.

#### 3. Authenticated options change

All four AJAX functions found in the “includes/options.php” script (`stm_listings_save_single_option_row`, `stm_listings_delete_single_option_row`, `stm_listings_save_option_order`, `stm_listings_add_new_option`) lack security nonces and capability check, allowing an authenticated user to modify, add or delete options and inject JS code similarly to the main unauthenticated settings import vulnerability described earlier.

### Timeline

A new version 1.4.1 was released on September 18, 2019.
