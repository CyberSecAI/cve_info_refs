CVE-2019-17639:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Calling the System.arraycopy method with a length longer than the length of the source or destination array can, in certain specially crafted code patterns, cause the current method to return prematurely with an undefined return value.
  - Weakness: CWE-843 (Type Confusion)
  - Impact of exploitation: Allows whatever value happens to be in the return register at that time to be used as if it matches the method's declared return type.
  - Affected component: Eclipse OpenJ9
  - Affected platforms: PowerPC
  - Affected versions: prior to 0.21
