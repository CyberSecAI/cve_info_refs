{
  "CVE-2019-17266": {
    "description": "libsoup from versions 2.65.1 until 2.68.1 have a heap-based buffer over-read because soup_ntlm_parse_challenge() in soup-auth-ntlm.c does not properly check an NTLM message's length before proceeding with a memcpy.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing length check in the `soup_ntlm_parse_challenge()` function before calling memcpy when parsing an NTLM message, leading to a heap-based buffer over-read.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "A user or automated system tricked into connecting to a malicious server could trigger the vulnerability by receiving a crafted NTLM message."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a server that the victim attempts to connect with NTLM authentication and send a crafted NTLM message",
     "affected_versions": "libsoup versions 2.65.1 up to 2.68.1"
