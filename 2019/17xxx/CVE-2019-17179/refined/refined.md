Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17179:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `list_id` query parameter in the `library/custom_template/add_template.php` file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to properly neutralize or encode user-supplied input (`list_id` parameter) before using it in the generation of the HTML response, leading to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted GET request to the vulnerable PHP file, specifically targeting the vulnerable `list_id` query parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable OpenEMR instance.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects OpenEMR versions 4.1.0 through 5.0.2 (excluding 5.0.2.1).
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is fixed in OpenEMR version 5.0.2.1.
- **Proof of Concept (POC) Exploit:** A curl command is provided as a demonstration of the exploit.
- The provided code example `curl "http://localhost/openemr/library/custom_template/add_template.php?list_id=1}});}}};alert(%27xss%27);function%20derp(){if%20(true){if(true){%20$.ajax({type:%22POST%22,data:{tempateid:%201"` clearly shows the malicious script being injected in the `list_id` parameter of the URL.

The provided information gives a good overview of the vulnerability, the affected versions, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
