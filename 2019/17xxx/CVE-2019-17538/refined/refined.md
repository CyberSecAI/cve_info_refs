The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in the `jnoj` application, specifically within the `ProblemController` of the `polygon` module:

**1. Arbitrary File Deletion:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `actionDeletefile` function in `app\modules\polygon\controllers\ProblemController` does not properly validate the filename provided in the `name` parameter before using it in an `unlink` operation. Specifically, the code at lines 89 to 113 of `ProblemController.php` uses the provided `$name` parameter directly in `unlink()`, enabling an attacker to navigate out of the intended directory and delete any file on the server accessible by the web server process.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Path traversal vulnerability. Lack of input validation/sanitization on the file name.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server, potentially leading to data loss, system instability, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a `name` parameter that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../jnoj/composer.lock`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application, therefore being able to access the application's web interface.

**2. Arbitrary File Read:**

*   **Root Cause:** The `actionViewfile` function in `app\modules\polygon\controllers\ProblemController`, specifically lines 115 to 121 of `ProblemController.php`, does not validate the filename provided in the `name` parameter before using it with the `file_get_contents` function. Similar to the file deletion vulnerability, this allows an attacker to read any file on the server accessible by the web server process using path traversal.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Path traversal vulnerability. Lack of input validation/sanitization on the file name.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server, potentially exposing sensitive information, configuration files, or source code.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious URL with a `name` parameter that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the application, therefore being able to access the application's web interface.

The provided content also includes example URLs for both attacks and screenshots demonstrating the exploits. The suggested fix is to validate the file names to prevent path traversal.

This information aligns with the general description of a file manipulation vulnerability caused by a lack of input sanitization and path traversal, and therefore the information is relevant to the vulnerability described in the CVE.
