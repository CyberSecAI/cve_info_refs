### @catenacyber **[catenacyber](/catenacyber)** commented [May 7, 2019](#issue-441263507)

Fixes #2969

Another solution would be to change Suricata detect-http-header.c so that

`if (AppLayerParserGetStateProgress(IPPROTO_TCP, ALPROTO_HTTP, tx, flags) <= HTP_RESPONSE_HEADERS)` does not apply when connection is closing

The ticket is about response headers but the same problem is present for request headers (and fixed in another commit)

Sorry, something went wrong.
