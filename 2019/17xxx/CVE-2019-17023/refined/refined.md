{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Network Security Services (NSS) library incorrectly handled the TLS state machine, allowing negotiation of a lower TLS protocol version after a TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest was sent.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect TLS state machine handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could cause NSS to enter an invalid state, leading to a denial of service by making the server ignore incoming application data records.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious TLS client initiating a handshake and sending a HelloRetryRequest to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to initiate TLS handshakes with a vulnerable server, and also the ability to manipulate the handshake to trigger the flawed logic",
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability is triggered when a client attempts to negotiate a lower protocol than TLS 1.3 after a TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest has been sent by the server. In such case the server will not properly process any further application data from the client. Although the resulting state is considered insecure the negotiation will include proper downgrade indicators, so valid TLS clients should not be impacted by this.",

      "NSS library"
