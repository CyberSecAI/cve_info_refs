# USN-4234-1: Firefox vulnerabilities

9 January 2020

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a malicious website.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [firefox](/security/cves?package=firefox) - Mozilla Open Source web browser

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions, conduct

cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or execute arbitrary code.

##### Ubuntu 19.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [72.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.19.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/72.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.19.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox)
  -
  [72.0.1+build1-0ubuntu0.18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/firefox/72.0.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.18.04.1)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1602843#c0)â¢ 5 years ago |
|  | |

I've been recently analyzing copying and pasting in browsers and found a bug similar to [bug 1599181](/show_bug.cgi?id=1599181 "VERIFIED FIXED - Bypass of CSS Sanitizer via incorrect serialization of CSS @namespace rule."), but this one allows a mutation XSS on pasting. The webpage needs to follow some specific pattern to be vulnerable but I could find some quite easily.

The root of the issue is exactly the same as it was in [bug 1599181](/show_bug.cgi?id=1599181 "VERIFIED FIXED - Bypass of CSS Sanitizer via incorrect serialization of CSS @namespace rule."), that is serializing of CSS. To recap, if pasted content contains `<style>` tag, Firefox decides to sanitize it. The stylesheet is pasted verbatim if it doesn't contain any "dangerous" rules (like `@import`), but it is rewritten if it does. Consider the following example:

```
<style>
@import'';
@font-face { font-family: 'ab<\/style><img src onerror=alert(1)>'}
</style>

```

Because of `@import`, after pasting, the code would be sanitized to:

```
<style>
@font-face { font-family: "ab</style><img src onerror=alert(1)>"; }
</style>

```

Please note how `<\/style>` was transformed to `</style>`. This doesn't introduce any issue by itself because in the case above, the text node of the stylesheet is modified directly, hence the `</style>` inside doesn't close the tag. However, if the application does something akin to:

```
textEditor.innerHTML = clipboardData.innerHTML;

```

then it is vulnerable to XSS, because the `<img>` tag would leave the `<style>` tag. It was my assumption that certain applications might do that and by quick googling I found **two** WYSIWYG editors who do exactly this. So perhaps there are even more.

# Proof of Concept

1. Go to <https://jsbin.com/xivapasere/1/edit?html,output>.
2. Press `copy me`.
3. Go to <https://rawgit.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/hotfix/src/demo/boilerplate/> (one of the editors that's vulnerable to this mutation XSS).
4. Give Aloha Editor a while to load...
5. Go to any `contenteditable` content.
6. Paste from clipboard.
7. Alert fires!

I don't consider it a bug in Aloha Editor, more of a bug in Firefox itself. To understand why `alert` fired, have a look at <https://rawgit.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/hotfix/src/plugins/common/paste/lib/paste-plugin.js> - line 274. What the editor does is that it paste the content in an invisible `<div>` (called `$clipboard` or `$CLIPBOARD` in the code).

Then, using jQuery, the code is parsed as HTML:

```
			if (typeof content === 'string') {
				$content = $('<div>' + content + '</div>');
			} else if (content instanceof $) {
				$content = $('<div>').append(content);
			}

```

In the PoC `content` is equal to `"<style>@font-face { font-family: \"ab</style><img src onerror=alert(1)>\"; }</style>"`, leading to an obvious XSS issue.

I think that perhaps Firefox sanitizer could always escape `<` to `\3c` in CSS strings to get rid of the issue?

For the record, I've also reported certain copy-and-paste bugs to Chromium and they decided to go a different way altogether and they just delete `<style>` tag from pasted content by serializing it into inline `style` attributes. I think that it significantly reduces the risk. Safari also does the same.

Here's the approach pasted from Chromium patch:

```
This patch follows the same approach as in WebKit [1]:
- First create a dummy document to insert the markup
- Then computes style and layout in the dummy document
- Re-serialize the dummy document as the markup to be inserted. This
  reuses the code path that we serialize a selection range into
  clipboard, where we need to serialize element computed style into
  inline styles so that the element styles are preserved.
- Make sure all style elements are removed before inserting markup
  into document

```

Hmm, in this case the string is perfectly valid CSS, so I think the bug here is in the DOM, which doesn't escape the resulting serialization as HTML... Or something of that sort.

I'm happy to take a look though.

This is indeed a DOM issue in certain way. Here's a [snippet from HTML5 spec](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/parsing.html#serialising-html-fragments):

> This can enable cross-site scripting attacks. An example of this would be a page that lets the user enter some font family names that are then inserted into a CSS style block via the DOM and which then uses the innerHTML IDL attribute to get the HTML serialization of that style element: if the user enters "</style><script>attack</script>" as a font family name, innerHTML will return markup that, if parsed in a different context, would contain a script node, even though no script node existed in the original DOM.

I think that one of two solutions could be employed here:

1. Change `<` to `\3c`. That wouldn't change anything in the content of the string, while would protect against the attack.
2. Detect that `<style>` contains `</style>` in its textContent and react somehow (like delete that element).

Hmm, this is a bit tricky as we can do this only on strings, I suspect...

> Detect that <style> contains </style> in its textContent and react somehow (like delete that element).

Hmm, that can work. it's a bit ugly because there are probably various edge cases involved (thought I don't know all the HTML tokenization rules).

Another thing that may work to prevent this kind of attack is just doing something like re-sanitizing until we reach a point where we don't need to sanitize. That seems less expensive than creating a new document and doing layout on it, as most of the time we'll stop real soon and do no extra work...

Henri, do you have any preference? You have way more background than me on this kind of stuff.

Oh, of course you could always go the Chrome and Safari way and delete `<style>` tags and re-insert them as inline `style` attributes. I feel that from purely security perspective this is the best approach (as it also protects against data exfiltration attacks).

It is also a regression in functionality though, as there's stuff you can't just stash in a `style` attribute, like `@media`, or what not... But sure, we could consider that as well.

Anyhow the bug is clearly not in the style system itself, but in how editor and the sanitizer uses it...

In fairnes, I think this is mostly an upstream library bug, but I'm simpathetic to the argument in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1602843#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Mutation XSS via copy-and-paste in WYSIWYG editors")... The fact that `innerHTML` doesn't produce output that roundtrips is quite nasty IMO, but probably too late to change that?

The question is whether we want to let users put `@media` in pasted content at all. Security issues aside, if you put the following HTML in the clipboard:

```
<style>
  * { background: red}
</style>

```

Then the whole page gets a red background, not only the pasted content, which I don't think is desirable.

My preference would be to escape `<` in CSS string literals in the CSS serializer if we change and reserialize the CSS.

It just sounds like some of the things that will be able to cause problems when websites (for example gmail :)) start relying on Chrome's behavior.

We should really consider alignment and interop with other browsers here. Not just for security's sake.

Well, I don't know. We do have some leeway here, but "just align with other browsers" is not particularly trivial.

Just from a quick look, Chrome uses a 800x600 thing for media queries, and they have various really [hacky fixups like this](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/%2B/master%3Athird_party/blink/renderer/core/editing/editing_style_utilities.cc;l=239;drc=5e5c8becf8ddb1bdaba3b01b8f279c9763a0d8d6)...

Their whole serialization strategy seems pretty different from ours.

This is not particularly easy because I'd need to propagate the "is this for the sanitizer" bit to every CSS string...

I think I can push stylesheet sanitization further down and preserve the input on a per-CSS-rule basis without too much trouble.

Also, I think right now we may trigger `@import` stylesheet loads in the target page which is pretty bad. We should reject them while parsing.

So, ok... I think for now I'll go with this approach after fixing that other sanitizer feature, and I'll file a follow-up bug to investigate removing all non-inline styles from the markup for paste (probably on Nightly-only, for now).

I agree it's a bit bizarre to allow arbitrary styles that can affect the whole page...

WebKit and Blink seem to have this sort of complex system to try to preserve copy&paste fidelity, which involves poking at the computed style of an element and trying to extract some of its properties and setting them as inline styles.

There's no fancy thing like that in Gecko, but I'm on the fence between horrifying (after having looked at WebKit's code) and neat.

Masayuki / Makoto, do you know if we have a bug tracking copy&paste fidelity improvements?

Anyhow, I think that should be a sensible plan for the time being, wdyt Freddy?

Attached patch

[esr68.patch](attachment.cgi?id=9116382&action=diff) (obsolete)
â [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9116382&action=edit)
â [Splinter Review](/page.cgi?id=splinter.html&ignore=&bug=1602843&attachment=9116382)

Two notes:

* I had to keep the old code-path for when XBL is enabled (so xbl-in-content pref or chrome docs).
* I had to update cssparser. So we'd be uplifting [bug 1563892](/show_bug.cgi?id=1563892 "RESOLVED FIXED - We incorrectly allow to create a percentage token with CSS variables.") too, but that seems fine.

I have reproduced the issue by copying the code with the "copy me" button from this (<https://jsbin.com/xivapasere/2/edit?html,output>) test page and then paste it anywhere on this (<https://rawgit.com/alohaeditor/Aloha-Editor/hotfix/src/demo/boilerplate/>) test page. A notification with the text "1" is displayed. Reproduced on Nightly v7.0a1 from 2019-12-12 and Beta v72.0b7.

Verified in Nightly v73.0a1 from 2019-12-16. Waiting for Beta build to verify.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them â but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

#### [#CVE-2019-17016: Bypass of @namespace CSS sanitization during pasting](#CVE-2019-17016)

Reporter
MichaÅ Bentkowski
Impact
high
##### Description

When pasting a `<style>` tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration.

#### [#CVE-2019-17019: Python files could be inadvertently executed upon opening a download](#CVE-2019-17019)

Reporter
Prithwish Kumar Pal
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When Python was installed on Windows, a python file being served with the MIME type of `text/plain` could be executed by Python instead of being opened as a text file when the Open option was selected upon download.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

* [Bug 1568003](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568003)

#### [#CVE-2019-17020: Content Security Policy not applied to XSL stylesheets applied to XML documents](#CVE-2019-17020)

Reporter
Matthew Somerville
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an XML file is served with a Content Security Policy and the XML file includes an XSL stylesheet, the Content Security Policy will not be applied to the contents of the XSL stylesheet. If the XSL sheet e.g. includes JavaScript, it would bypass any of the restrictions of the Content Security Policy applied to the XML document.

#### [#CVE-2019-17021: Heap address disclosure in parent process during content process initialization on Windows](#CVE-2019-17021)

Reporter
Thomas Imbert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During the initialization of a new content process, a race condition occurs that can allow a content process to disclose heap addresses from the parent process.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1599008](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599008)

#### [#CVE-2019-17022: CSS sanitization does not escape HTML tags](#CVE-2019-17022)

Reporter
MichaÅ Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When pasting a `<style>` tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer does not escape < and > characters. Because the resulting string is pasted directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were identified with this behavior, more may exist.

* [Bug 1602843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1602843)

#### [#CVE-2019-17023: NSS may negotiate TLS 1.2 or below after a TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest had been sent](#CVE-2019-17023)

Reporter
Google oss-fuzz
Impact
low
##### Description

After a HelloRetryRequest has been sent, the client may negotiate a lower protocol that TLS 1.3, resulting in an invalid state transition in the TLS State Machine. If the client gets into this state, incoming Application Data records will be ignored.

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

The fuzzer found an issue.

Marking this as critical as it appears to be a state machine issue in TLS 1.3 (`ssl3con.c:12805`), i.e. the state is `ssl_ct_application_data` and `ssl_0rtt_ignore_hrr` while not waiting for a client hello (`wait_client_hello`).

I recommend removing the offending code change <https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss/rev/bc77cf318f388f55790b99d5f23a9c1f2bd9f900?revcount=10000>, i.e. disable TLS 1.3 again until the issue is fixed.

To reproduce build nss with `./build.sh --fuzz --asan` and run `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../dist/Debug/lib/ nssfuzz-tls-server testcase`.

Yeah, I analyzed this today. I found that we aren't recording anything about having sent HelloRetryRequest. The fix is trivial: we check `ss->ssl3.hs.helloRetry` and reject versions less than TLS 1.3 when selecting a version AND/OR constrain the version range to include just TLS 1.3 when we send HelloRetryRequest.

The trick is in replicating the scenario. I've a test that is partially there, but not yet crashing. Kevin, do you want to take the patch?

Guessing about the disclosure deadline: I can't see the oss-fuzz issue so I don't know when it was filed, but typically they make those public after 90 days.

What kind of crash is this? Some kind of memory corruption that would be useful for an exploit? Something that could be manipulated to cause a bogus insecure TLS state instead of crashing? Or does it just crash and save us from doing something insecure?

No memory issue here. NSS allows to negotiate TLS < 1.3 after an HRR has been sent and thus runs into an assert that checks whether NSS expects a client hello or not. In debug builds we crash and in release build this simply stops handling the incoming record. I don't see any easy way to exploit this.

Yes, in effect, we are permitting clients to start with TLS 1.3 and then continue the handshake with TLS 1.2. So we definitely have a screwy TLS state, albeit one the client asked for. I checked fairly thoroughly and couldn't find any landmines other than the version downgrade, but I can't be entirely sure. The only things in our favour are that the work we do prior to sending HelloRetryRequest is pretty minimal AND our ClientHello processing assumes nothing, not even a clean slate, thanks to our renegotiation support.

So there is some uncertainty here, but most of the signs indicate that this isn't that bad. A client that gets the HelloRetryRequest won't do this if it is at all sane, and otherwise a client wouldn't do this unless it wanted to cause us to crash (which we won't in release builds as far as I can see, though I'm not completely sure).

The actual asserting code that we hit here is a dead-end that just causes the packet to be dropped. So if someone gets us into this state, in a non-debug build, we will just drop every Application Data record we get. I couldn't find a crasher for a regular build. And dropping data probably isn't that useful to an attacker.

As the tests paint a target on the problem, (even though the first is a red herring), I think that we should probably split the patch into two and land the fix, but I would only wait until the fix is in a build before doing so.

I don't think this warrants ESR uplift. If an attacker prompts this scenario, it's a DoS, which we don't usually uplift unless egregious.

I believe so, yes, however it doesn't lead to a crash unless you're in a debug build. The bad transition just makes the connection stall.

Does this affect servers that use NSS for their TLS?

Yes. The but the effect is only that clients can force you to negotiate a nonsensical session that is still as secure as a regular handshake with TLS 1.2. We still send the downgrade indicators properly, so there is no risk to a valid client.

# USN-4397-1: NSS vulnerabilities

16 June 2020

Several security issues were fixed in NSS.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](/security/notices?release=focal)
* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [nss](/security/cves?package=nss) - Network Security Service library

## Details

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled the TLS State Machine. A

remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NSS to hang,

resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

and Ubuntu 19.10. ([CVE-2019-17023](/security/CVE-2019-17023))

Cesar Pereida Garcia discovered that NSS incorrectly handled DSA key

generation. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a

timing attack and recover DSA keys. ([CVE-2020-12399](/security/CVE-2020-12399))
