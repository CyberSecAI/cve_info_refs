Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-17636:

*   **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Read
*   **Affected Component:** `mini-browser` extension in Eclipse Theia. The `mini-browser` extension exposes a HTTP endpoint that allows reading files on the host's filesystem without origin restrictions.
*   **Root Cause:** The `mini-browser` extension spawns a local web server that serves files and renders them in an iframe. The server exposes the entire host filesystem through a custom endpoint *without* proper origin restrictions.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **DNS Rebinding:** An attacker could use DNS rebinding to bypass same-origin policy restrictions.
    *   **Drive-by Download:** An attacker could trick a user into downloading a malicious HTML file that exploits the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read any file on the victim's filesystem, given its path.
*   **Attack Scenario:**
    1.  A user runs an Electron Theia-based IDE on their local workstation.
    2.  The user visits an attacker-controlled web page.
    3.  The attacker's page initiates the download of an HTML file into a new tab.
    4.  The attacker redirects the victim to the downloaded HTML file through the local mini-browser web server (e.g., `http://localhost:<port>/mini-browser/<path_to_downloaded_file>`).
    5.  The attacker's HTML file now has access to the localhost origin and can request arbitrary files from the victim's filesystem using the mini-browser endpoint.
    6.  The attacker's script exfiltrates the local files (e.g., by encoding them as base64 and sending them via form/xhr).
*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was fixed by removing the mini-browser HTTP endpoint when running on Electron. Instead, it will open files using `file://`
