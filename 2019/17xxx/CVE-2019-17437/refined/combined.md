### Description

Palo Alto Networks is aware of a memory corruption vulnerability in PAN-OS (Ref: # PAN-123603/CVE-2019-1580).

Successful exploitation will allow a remote, unauthenticated user to craft a message to Secure Shell Daemon (SSHD) and corrupt arbitrary memory.

This issue affects PAN-OS 7.1.24 and earlier, PAN-OS 8.0.19 and earlier, PAN-OS 8.1.9 and earlier, and PAN-OS 9.0.3 and earlier.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| PAN-OS 9.0 | <= 9.0.3 | >= 9.0.3-h3 |
| PAN-OS 8.1 | <= 8.1.9 | >= 8.1.9-h4 |
| PAN-OS 8.0 | <= 8.0.19 | >= 8.0.19-h1 |
| PAN-OS 7.1 | <= 7.1.24 | >= 7.1.24-h1 |

### Severity: CRITICAL

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
9.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119")

### Solution

PAN-OS 7.1.24-h1 and later, PAN-OS 8.0.19-h1 and later, PAN-OS 8.1.9-h4 and later, and PAN-OS 9.0.3-h3 and later.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

These issues affect the management interface of PAN-OS and are strongly mitigated by following best practices for securing the PAN-OS management interface. Our best practices guidelines reduce the exposure of the management interface to potential attackers. Please review the Best Practices for Securing Administrative Access in the PAN-OS 9.0 technical documentation, available at: <https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/getting-started/best-practices-for-securing-administrative-access.html>.
