Subject: Xen Security Advisory 288 v3 (CVE-2019-17343) - x86: Inconsistent
 PV IOMMU discipline

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA256

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17343 / XSA-288
                              version 3

                 x86: Inconsistent PV IOMMU discipline

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In order for a PV domain to set up DMA from a passed-through device to
one of its pages, the page must be mapped in the IOMMU.  On the other
hand, before a PV page may be used as a "special" page type (such as a
pagetable or descriptor table), it _must not_ be writable in the IOMMU
(otherwise a malicious guest could DMA arbitrary page tables into the
memory, bypassing Xen's safety checks); and Xen's current rule is to
have such pages not in the IOMMU at all.

Until now, in order to accomplish this, the code has borrowed HVM
domain's "physmap" concept: When a page is assigned to a guest,
guess_physmap_add_entry() is called, which for PV guests, will create
a writable IOMMU mapping; and when a page is removed,
guest_physmap_remove_entry() is called, which will remove the mapping.

Additionally, when a page gains the PGT_writable page type, the page
will be added into the IOMMU; and when the page changes away from a
PGT_writable type, the page will be removed from the IOMMU.

Unfortunately, borrowing the "physmap" concept from HVM domains is
problematic.  HVM domains have a lock on their p2m tables, ensuring
synchronization between modifications to the p2m; and all hypercall
parameters must first be translated through the p2m before being used.
Trying to mix this locked-and-gated approach with PV's lock-free
approach leads to several races and inconsistencies.

IMPACT
======

An untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device can DMA into
its own pagetables, leading to privilege escalation.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only systems where PV guests are given direct access to physical
devices (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable.  Systems with only HVM
guests, or systems which do not use PCI pass-through, are not
vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Only assigning devices to HVM guests will avoid these vulnerabilities.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor, which
could result in denial of service, guest-to-host privilege escalation or
information leaks.

In addition this update provides mitigations for the "TSX Asynchronous Abort"
speculative side channel attack. For additional information please refer to
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html>

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.5.final+shim4.10.4-1+deb9u12. Note that this will be the
last security update for Xen in the oldstable distribution; upstream
support for the 4.8.x branch ended by the end of December 2019. If you
rely on security support for your Xen installation an update to the
stable distribution (buster) is recommended.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.3+24-g14b62ab3e5-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

                 CVE-2019-17341 CVE-2019-17340

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor, which
could result in denial of service, guest-to-host privilege escalation or
information leaks.

In addition this update provides mitigations for the "TSX Asynchronous Abort"
speculative side channel attack. For additional information please refer to
<https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html>

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.5.final+shim4.10.4-1+deb9u12. Note that this will be the
last security update for Xen in the oldstable distribution; upstream
support for the 4.8.x branch ended by the end of December 2019. If you
rely on security support for your Xen installation an update to the
stable distribution (buster) is recommended.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.11.3+24-g14b62ab3e5-1~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.

For the detailed security status of xen please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/xen>

            Xen Security Advisory CVE-2019-17343 / XSA-288
                              version 3

                 x86: Inconsistent PV IOMMU discipline

UPDATES IN VERSION 3
====================

CVE assigned.

ISSUE DESCRIPTION
=================

In order for a PV domain to set up DMA from a passed-through device to
one of its pages, the page must be mapped in the IOMMU.  On the other
hand, before a PV page may be used as a "special" page type (such as a
pagetable or descriptor table), it _must not_ be writable in the IOMMU
(otherwise a malicious guest could DMA arbitrary page tables into the
memory, bypassing Xen's safety checks); and Xen's current rule is to
have such pages not in the IOMMU at all.

Until now, in order to accomplish this, the code has borrowed HVM
domain's "physmap" concept: When a page is assigned to a guest,
guess_physmap_add_entry() is called, which for PV guests, will create
a writable IOMMU mapping; and when a page is removed,
guest_physmap_remove_entry() is called, which will remove the mapping.

Additionally, when a page gains the PGT_writable page type, the page
will be added into the IOMMU; and when the page changes away from a
PGT_writable type, the page will be removed from the IOMMU.

Unfortunately, borrowing the "physmap" concept from HVM domains is
problematic.  HVM domains have a lock on their p2m tables, ensuring
synchronization between modifications to the p2m; and all hypercall
parameters must first be translated through the p2m before being used.
Trying to mix this locked-and-gated approach with PV's lock-free
approach leads to several races and inconsistencies.

IMPACT
======

An untrusted PV domain with access to a physical device can DMA into
its own pagetables, leading to privilege escalation.

VULNERABLE SYSTEMS
==================

Only x86 systems are vulnerable.  ARM systems are not vulnerable.

Only systems where PV guests are given direct access to physical
devices (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable.  Systems with only HVM
guests, or systems which do not use PCI pass-through, are not
vulnerable.

MITIGATION
==========

Only assigning devices to HVM guests will avoid these vulnerabilities.

CREDITS
=======

This issue was discovered by Paul Durrant of Citrix.

RESOLUTION
==========

Applying the appropriate attached patch resolves this issue.

DEPLOYMENT DURING EMBARGO
=========================

Deployment of the patches and/or mitigations described above (or
others which are substantially similar) is permitted during the
embargo, even on public-facing systems with untrusted guest users and
administrators.

But: Distribution of updated software is prohibited (except to other
members of the predisclosure list).

Predisclosure list members who wish to deploy significantly different
patches and/or mitigations, please contact the Xen Project Security
Team.

(Note: this during-embargo deployment notice is retained in
post-embargo publicly released Xen Project advisories, even though it
is then no longer applicable.  This is to enable the community to have
oversight of the Xen Project Security Team's decisionmaking.)

For more information about permissible uses of embargoed information,
consult the Xen Project community's agreed Security Policy:
