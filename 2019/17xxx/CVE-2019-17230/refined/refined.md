- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WordPress OneTone theme lacks capability checks and security nonces in its theme options import feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated options import, stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into all pages and posts of the website. This code can also target logged-in administrators when they edit the theme in the WordPress back-end.
- **Attack vectors:** An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the theme's options import feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required. The attacker only needs to access the vulnerable site.
