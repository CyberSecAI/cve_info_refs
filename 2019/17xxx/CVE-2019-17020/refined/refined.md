CVE-2019-17020:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Content Security Policy (CSP) was not applied to XSL stylesheets when applied to XML documents. If an XML file, served with a CSP, included an XSL stylesheet, the CSP would not be applied to the contents of the XSL stylesheet.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: CSP bypass, inline script execution.
  - Impact of exploitation: If the XSL sheet included JavaScript, it would bypass any restrictions of the CSP applied to the XML document, potentially leading to XSS or other attacks.
  - Attack vectors: An attacker could serve a malicious XML file with a CSP, referencing an XSL stylesheet containing malicious JavaScript. When a user opens the XML file in Firefox, the JavaScript in the XSL stylesheet would execute, bypassing the CSP.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to serve a malicious XML file (e.g., by hosting it on a website or sending it to a victim).
