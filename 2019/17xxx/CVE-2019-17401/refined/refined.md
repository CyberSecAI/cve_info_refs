- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read occurs in `liblnk_location_information_read_data` at `liblnk_location_information.c:1090` when processing a crafted LNK file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow leading to an out-of-bounds read. The ASAN output indicates the read occurs one byte beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The out-of-bounds read can cause a crash of the `lnkinfo` tool, as demonstrated by the ASAN output which terminates the program.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a maliciously crafted LNK file as input to the `lnkinfo` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted LNK file as input to the vulnerable `lnkinfo` tool.
