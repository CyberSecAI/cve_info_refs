Based on the provided documentation, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-17642:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the processing of data sent via JSON in Ajax requests. It allows for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The core issue is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server. The vulnerability exists within the handling of data received through AJAX requests, specifically how the JSON data is processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise. This includes data theft, service disruption, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Requests:** The attack vector is through malicious JSON data sent within AJAX requests to the Centreon Auto Discovery component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker would require network access to the Centreon Auto Discovery web interface to send the crafted AJAX requests.
*   **Knowledge of the API/Data Structure**: The attacker needs to know how to craft malicious JSON data in a way that triggers the vulnerability in the AJAX request handling.

**Affected Versions:**
*   Centreon Auto Discovery 18.10.8
*   Centreon Auto Discovery 19.04.2
*   Centreon Auto Discovery 19.10.1

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Centreon Auto Discovery versions later than those listed above by implementing proper validation of the JSON data received from Ajax requests.
