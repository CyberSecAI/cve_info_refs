{
  "CVE-2019-17056": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Linux kernel's NFC (Near Field Communication) network protocol implementation did not properly enforce permission checks when creating raw sockets.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of CAP_NET_RAW capability enforcement in the `llcp_sock_create` function, allowing any local user to create raw AF_NFC sockets.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local user could exploit this vulnerability to send arbitrary packets on networks using the NFC protocol.",
    "Attack vectors": "A local attacker with no special privileges could send arbitrary network packets.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be a local user on the affected system."
