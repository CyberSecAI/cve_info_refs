  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a flaw that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on OnCommand Cloud Manager versions prior to 3.8.0.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Arbitrary Code Execution"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to remote arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote attacker"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned other than a remote network connection to a vulnerable instance of OnCommand Cloud Manager.",
    "cve": "CVE-2019-17275",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists in OnCommand Cloud Manager versions prior to 3.8.0, which can be exploited remotely leading to arbitrary code execution. The advisory emphasizes the need for users to upgrade to a patched version (3.8.0 or later). Automatic upgrades mitigate this risk, but manual upgrades are necessary if this feature is not enabled. The advisory notes that only the setup phase of older, vulnerable installations is exploitable, as the software updates automatically upon initial setup."
