- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data when parsing JSON in several APIs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation when deserializing JSON data, allowing for the injection of malicious payloads.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Deletion of files on the server.
    - Denial of Service (DoS).
    - Remote code execution (RCE) in affected versions prior to 10.14.0.
    - The impact is limited to files accessible by the user running the Jamf Pro process.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted JSON request to certain vulnerable endpoints in Jamf Pro.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can send requests to the vulnerable API endpoints without authentication, which means no privileges or specific position is necessary.
