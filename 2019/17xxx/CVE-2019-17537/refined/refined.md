Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `ProblemController` in `jnoj` application lacks proper input validation for file paths when handling delete and view file operations. This allows an attacker to manipulate the `$name` parameter, enabling them to access files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:**
    *   The `actionDeletefile` function uses the `unlink()` function without validating the `$name` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server for deletion using path traversal (e.g., `../../../../jnoj/composer.lock`).
    *   Specifically, lines 89-113 in `app\modules\polygon\controllers\ProblemController` are vulnerable.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:**
    *   The `actionViewfile` function uses the `file_get_contents()` function without validating the `$name` parameter, allowing an attacker to specify any file path on the server for reading using path traversal (e.g., `../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).
    *  Specifically, lines 115-121 in `app\modules\polygon\controllers\ProblemController` are vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** An attacker can delete any file accessible to the web server user, potentially disrupting the application or the system's functionality, including configuration or system files.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read the content of any file accessible to the web server user, which could expose sensitive information, such as configuration files, source code, or database credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exposed through HTTP requests by manipulating the `name` parameter in the `deletefile` and `viewfile` actions.
*   The attacker would craft malicious URLs with path traversal sequences to target arbitrary files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the application's web interface.
*   The attacker must be able to craft and send HTTP requests with malicious parameters.

**Code Snippets:**

*   **Vulnerable Delete Code:**

    ```php
    public function actionDeletefile($id, $name)
        {
            $model = $this->findModel($id);
            if ($name == 'in') {
                $files = $model->getDataFiles();
                foreach ($files as $file) {
                    if (strpos($file['name'], '.in')) {
                        @unlink(Yii::$app->params['judgeProblemDataPath'] . $model->id . '/' . $file['name']);
                    }
                }
            } else if ($name == 'out') {
                $files = $model->getDataFiles();
                foreach ($files as $file) {
                    if (strpos($file['name'], '.out')) {
                        @unlink(Yii::$app->params['judgeProblemDataPath'] . $model->id . '/' . $file['name']);
                    }
                    if (strpos($file['name'], '.ans')) {
                        @unlink(Yii::$app->params['judgeProblemDataPath'] . $model->id . '/' . $file['name']);
                    }
                }
            } else {
                @unlink(Yii::$app->params['judgeProblemDataPath'] . $model->id . '/' . $name);
            }
            return $this->redirect(['test-data', 'id' => $model->id]);
        }
    ```
*   **Vulnerable Read Code:**
    ```php
    public function actionViewfile($id, $name)
        {
            $model = $this->findModel($id);
            echo '<pre>';
            echo file_get_contents(Yii::$app->params['judgeProblemDataPath'] . $model->id . '/' . $name);
            echo '</pre>';
        }
    ```

**Mitigation:**

*   The issue report suggests that the fix involves validating the file names passed as input in the `name` parameter. This would include checking for and rejecting path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
