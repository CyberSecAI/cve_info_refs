Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown for CVE-2019-17116:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application does not sanitize the `groupName` parameter on `groups.jsp` when creating a new group. This allows a malicious user to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the group name.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a malicious group name is created, the injected JavaScript will execute in the context of the application, potentially allowing an attacker to:
  - Steal session cookies
  - Redirect users to malicious websites
  - Perform actions on behalf of the victim user
  - Deface the application

**Attack vectors:**
- A user with the ability to create a group uses a crafted `groupName` with malicious script.
- When other users, including admins, visit the `groups.jsp` page, the stored XSS payload will execute in their browsers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to create groups in the application.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and how to inject the malicious script.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `groups.jsp` file.
- The injected script is stored and executed every time the `groups.jsp` page is visited.
