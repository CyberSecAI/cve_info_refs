Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the GlobalProtect App for Windows' auto-update feature. Specifically, it doesn't properly validate the integrity of the MSI installer package before installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The vulnerability allows a low-privileged local user to modify the GlobalProtect App MSI installer package before it's installed, effectively subverting the intended privilege control of the installation process.
*   **Lack of Integrity Check:** The auto-update mechanism does not properly verify the integrity of the downloaded MSI package before execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows a low-privileged local user to escalate their privileges to the System user, gaining complete control of the system.
*   **Modification of MSI installer**: A low privileged attacker can modify the MSI installer to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack Vector:** The attacker must have local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable GlobalProtect App is installed.
*   **Modification of the installer**: The attacker must have write access to the location where the MSI installer is downloaded before its execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Local User:** The attacker only needs to have a low-privileged user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to modify the MSI Installer**: The attacker must be able to modify the downloaded MSI installer package before the installation process starts.

**Affected Versions:**

*   GlobalProtect App 5.0.3 and earlier for Windows
*   GlobalProtect App 4.1.12 and earlier for Windows

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to GlobalProtect App 4.1.13 or later for Windows.
*   Upgrade to GlobalProtect App 5.0.4 or later for Windows.
