Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17070:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Affected Product:** WordPress LIQUID SPEECH BALLOON plugin
*   **Affected Version:** 1.0.5
*   **Attack Type:** Local
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS because Internet Explorer (IE) treats the accent grave (\`) as an attribute delimiter, similar to double quotes (") and single quotes ('). The HTML filter used by the plugin doesn't account for this IE-specific behavior, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting JavaScript code using the accent grave as an attribute delimiter.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to steal cookies.
*   **Attacker Capability:** No specific attacker capabilities are mentioned beyond the ability to inject malicious code into the affected input field.
*   **Mitigation:** The vendor fixed the security issue in later versions. See Changelog for versions 1.0.7 and 1.2.
