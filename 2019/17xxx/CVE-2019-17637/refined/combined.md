# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

I believe this is a valid vulnerability.   I attached an improved POC that if opened in Eclipse, exfiltrates the contents of an arbitrary file to a remote server. My POC sends /etc/hostname, but it could easily be modified to send /etc/passwd or even local SSH keys.   While it is true that this is not a classic sever side vulnerability, I do still think it has a significant impact. In order for an attacker to exploit it, they would simply have to convince their victim to open a file in Eclipse. As a software engineer, I constantly find myself opening up and poking through random codebases on the internet. This could even be very effective as a watering hole attack where the attacker could just post the code on GitHub and attack anyone who downloads it.   This same vulnerability was found in VS Code and Eclipse Theia and they both agreed that it was a valid vulnerability and issued a CVE for it (<https://www.shielder.it/blog/dont-open-that-xml-xxe-to-rce-in-xml-plugins-for-vs-code-eclipse-theia/>). Why do you think it is not a vulnerability? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c8)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-15 09:58:03 EDT  ``` (In reply to David Dworken from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c7)) > While it is true that this is not a classic sever side vulnerability... > Why do you think it is not a vulnerability?  That was why, and I eventually addressed it just to be sure against the runnable POC in [bug 508083](show_bug.cgi?id=508083 "RESOLVED FIXED"). Are you able to reproduce this within the XML tools in the current release? ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c9)  David Dworken [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-15 20:54:07 EDT  ``` Yes, I can reproduce this on the latest version of Eclipse on Ubuntu 20.04. See the attached video which shows /etc/hostname getting sent to my external server. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c10)  David Dworken [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-15 20:54:37 EDT  ``` Created [attachment 283292](attachment.cgi?id=283292 "demo exploit") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=283292&action=edit "demo exploit") demo exploit ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c11)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-15 23:45:33 EDT  ``` Is that with the default preferences? ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c12)  David Dworken [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-16 21:00:00 EDT  ``` Yup, a completely fresh install from `sudo snap install --classic eclipse`.

If you want to test it with my server, I set up some logs to be accessible on my website. The endpoint `<https://daviddworken.com/eclipse-log.txt>` will contain logs from testing my updated `evil.xml`. After opening it in Eclipse, I see two new lines added to the logs:  ``` Jun 17 13:52:07 Website caddy[2066]: 2020/06/17 13:52:07 206.189.167.245 - - [17/Jun/2020:13:52:07 +0000] "GET /eclipse-exfiltrate.dtd HTTP/1.1" 200 172 Jun 17 13:52:07 Website caddy[2066]: 2020/06/17 13:52:07 206.189.167.245 - - [17/Jun/2020:13:52:07 +0000] "GET /eclipse-data?x=dworken-x1 HTTP/1.1" 404 14 ```  Which shows that it is exfiltrating /etc/hostname. ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c21)  David Dworken [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 09:55:48 EDT  ``` Created [attachment 283323](attachment.cgi?id=283323 "updated POC") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=283323&action=edit "updated POC") updated POC ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c22)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 10:00:15 EDT  ``` New Gerrit change created: <https://git.eclipse.org/r/165058> ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c23)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 11:19:02 EDT  ``` Gerrit change <https://git.eclipse.org/r/165058> was merged to [master].

Is there something else I need to do in order to get it to install the update?   The furthest it thinks it can update is:  ``` Version: 2020-06 (4.16.0) Build id: 20200615-1200 ``` ```  [Comment 27](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c27)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 14:24:40 EDT  ``` I'm puzzled about that myself. You should still be able to use the site o attempt to install the newer build of the Eclipse XML Editors and Tools, which it should then say will be treated as an update. ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c28)  David Dworken [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 14:39:25 EDT  ``` Ah, got it! Instead of adding it as a software site for updates I instead tried to install plugins from it and selected all plugins available and that got it to download the update.   Yes, after that patch it is fixed. :+1:   Can you request the CVE for this or should I ask Wayne to request it? And how does the below description look?   Eclipse IDE was vulnerable to an XXE attack if a user opened an untrusted XML file. This could be exploited in order to exfiltrate local files to a remote server. ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c29)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 14:42:45 EDT  ``` (In reply to David Dworken from [comment #28](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c28)) > Can you request the CVE for this or should I ask Wayne to request it?

I think CVEs are handled at the organization level, but Wayne would know for certain (at least, he's who I'd ask). ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c30)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-17 21:00:28 EDT  ``` Merged into development and in our CI builds.

Nitin, if helpful here is my understanding of the information:  project: Eclipse IDE  version: [20150109, 20200615]  cwe: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference  summary: In Eclipse IDE prior to 2020-09, viewed XML files were validated by a parser that retrieved external XML entities. If a user opened an untrusted XML file, this could be exploited in order to exfiltrate local files to a remote server. ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c33)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-06-18 22:49:14 EDT  ``` David, that's a little too broad as our XML tools are not a part of every IDE download and installation.   project: Eclipse Web Tools Platform, XML Editors and Tools  versions: 1.0 - 3.18  cwe: CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE)  summary: Up through release 3.18 (2020-06), XML and DTD files referring to external entities could be exploited to send the contents of local files to a remote server when edited or validated, even when external entity resolution is disabled in the user preferences. ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c34)  David Dworken [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-07-08 19:25:11 EDT  ``` That description looks good to me. Nitin, can you email that information to security@eclipse.org so they can issue the CVE? ```  [Comment 35](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c35)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-07-09 14:01:48 EDT  ``` My apologies. I should have interpreted Nitin's reply as "make this happen".  We'll need to remove the committers-only flag. Any concerns?  I'll use CVE-2019-17637 for this. ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c36)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-07-09 14:07:05 EDT  ``` The biggest concern is that we don't have a fixed release out to direct people to. ```  [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c37)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-07-09 14:27:32 EDT  ``` (In reply to Nitin Dahyabhai from [comment #36](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c36)) > The biggest concern is that we don't have a fixed release out to direct > people to.  The CVE is going to draw some attention :-)  The "references" link (i.e. this record) needs to be publicly accessible before I push the report to the central authority.   While I think that we can argue that the issue has been recognized as a vulnerability for less than the three months maximum required by the vulnerability reporting policy [1], the issue was reported some number of years ago and my feeling is that we need to disclose it sooner rather than later.  [1] <https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php#security-timing> ```  [Comment 38](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c38)  Nitin Dahyabhai [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-07-09 15:17:54 EDT  ``` (In reply to Wayne Beaton from [comment #37](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c37))  The original POC didn't show local content being uploaded the way that David's does, only that the remote site was contacted, which didn't look out of place. That case was likely covered with the Oxygen release.  I'll defer to you on the publishing, Wayne. ```  [Comment 39](show_bug.cgi?id=458571#c39)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-07-15 10:53:13 EDT  ``` > I'll defer to you on the publishing, Wayne.  I've made a pull request to the central authority.  <https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/pull/4311> ``` |  |
