{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `LZ4_write32` function, which is related to `LZ4_compress_destSize`. This happens when `LZ4_compress_fast` is called with a large input.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially causing data corruption, application crash, or arbitrary code execution if exploited. It affects applications using `LZ4_compress_fast` with large inputs.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is network, requiring a high attack complexity and no user interaction.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker doesn't require any privileges to exploit the vulnerability, but needs to send a crafted large input. It could be triggered remotely over a network.",
    "additional_details": "The issue stems from an incorrect size calculation when shortening a match to fit the output buffer. When the new match position is before the current position, the hash table needs to be zeroed out at positions that are beyond the new position to prevent corruption. The initial fix had an off-by-one error, which was later corrected. The vulnerability can be triggered in specific uncommon usages of the API, and not via the command line interface."
