  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2019-17228",
      "root_cause": "The plugin's settings import/export functionality lacks capability checks and security nonces, making it accessible to unauthenticated users. Additionally, the imported options are not sanitized or validated before being displayed, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Unauthenticated settings import/export",
        "Lack of input sanitization/validation",
        "Stored XSS"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated user can import malicious settings containing JavaScript code, leading to stored XSS vulnerabilities in the WordPress backend when an administrator views the plugin's configuration page. This could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, steal cookies, or deface the site.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker can access the vulnerable import/export functionality by sending a GET request to the site with the export parameter set, to obtain the plugin's current settings. Then, they can craft a malicious JSON file, inject JavaScript or any other HTML code into vulnerable fields, and upload it via the import parameter to inject code into the site's database.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any authentication or user privileges, and only requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the target site."
