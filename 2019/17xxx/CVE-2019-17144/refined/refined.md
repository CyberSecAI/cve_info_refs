- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when converting DWG files to PDF, leading to a write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious DWG file or visiting a malicious web page that triggers the conversion process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious DWG file or control the content of a webpage visited by the victim. The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
