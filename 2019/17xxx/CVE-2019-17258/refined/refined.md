  "CVE-2019-17258": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted JPEG_LS file due to a faulting address being used to control a subsequent write address.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Data from a faulting address is used as the target for a later write operation, leading to a potential write-what-where condition.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation could allow an attacker to overwrite memory at an arbitrary address, leading to code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a crafted JPEG_LS file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create and deliver a malicious JPEG_LS file to the victim. The victim must then open this file using the vulnerable IrfanView application."
