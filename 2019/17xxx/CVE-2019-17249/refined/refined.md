Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17249:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the WSQ plugin (Wsq.dll) of IrfanView when processing a specially crafted WSQ file.
- The specific instruction causing the vulnerability is a `movdqa` operation at memory address `WSQ!ReadWSQ+0xd57b` (`657ae5cb 660f7f4750 movdqa xmmword ptr [edi+50h],xmm0`). This instruction attempts to write data to a memory location that is not authorized, leading to a User Mode Write Access Violation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- User Mode Write Access Violation. The program attempts to write to a memory address that it does not have permission to access. This occurs during the processing of a crafted WSQ file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting this vulnerability results in a crash of the IrfanView application due to the access violation.
- In a more advanced attack scenario, this type of vulnerability could potentially be leveraged to achieve arbitrary code execution, but this is not explicitly stated in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by opening a specially crafted WSQ file using IrfanView.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver or trick the user into opening a malicious WSQ file. This indicates a local attack vector where the attacker has some level of access to the user's machine or can deliver the file through social engineering.

**Additional Notes:**
- The specific memory address causing the fault is `ds:002b:0b990000=`. This is where the write is attempted.
- The vulnerable version of IrfanView is 4.53, according to the provided information.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Infiniti Team, VinCSS (a member of Vingroup).

This analysis provides more specific details than what is typically available in a basic CVE description. It includes the exact assembly instruction and memory location involved in the crash.
