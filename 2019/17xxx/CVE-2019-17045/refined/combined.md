**Product Owner**: Rapid Software LLC

**Type:**  Installable/Customer-Controlled Application

**Application Name**: [Rapid SCADA 5.8.0](https://rapidscada.org/download/scada_5.8.0_full_en.zip)

Rapid SCADA is an open source industrial automation platform. The out of the box software provides tools for rapid creation of monitoring and control systems. In case of large implementation, Rapid SCADA is used as a core for development of custom SCADA and MES solutions for a Customer.

Open source is the key to software transparency and security. The licensing model permits creation of new derivative software products.

The main classes of systems developed using Rapid SCADA are the following:

* Industrial automation systems and IIoT systems.
* Process control systems.
* Energy accounting systems.

**Product Url:** <https://rapidscada.org/>

**Download Url:** <https://rapidscada.org/download-all-files/download-rapid-scada/>

**Application Release** **Date**: 2020-01-28

**Severity:** **High**

**Authentication:** Required

**Complexity:** Hard

**Vulnerability Name:** Rapid SCADA Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability via ScadaAgentSvc.exe, ScadaCommSvc.exe

**Vulnerability Explanation:** **Privilege escalation** is the act of exploiting a [bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug), design flaw or configuration oversight in an [operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) or [software application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_application) to gain elevated access to [resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_%28computer_science%29) that are normally protected from an application or [user](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_%28computing%29). The result is that an application with more [privileges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_%28computing%29) than intended by the [application developer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer) or [system administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) can perform [unauthorized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) actions.

**Tested Os:**Windows 10 Pro

**Vulnerability Details:**

Due to this COVID-19 outbreak, I was testing a lot of open source applications to learn new types of attacks and help our infosec community people to gain more awareness. So by googling I landed to this Rapid SCADA software which is free and it is used by a lot of people.

So installed the application and started with the basic enumeration process to check whether it has any service-related vulnerabilities.

I took a look at the application service just for curiosity and found that that there is no unquoted service path vulnerability.

* ![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-21-13_58_48-windows-10-x64-vmware-workstation-1.png?w=585)

* ![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-21-13_58_07-windows-10-x64-vmware-workstation-1.png?w=590)

  Service Enumeration

![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-12.png?w=1024)

**ScadaAgentConfig.xml – Default directory location**

**Rapid Scada 5.8.0 Default installation directory**

![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/image-13.png?w=598)

I had a look at the folder permissions of the “C:\ SCADA” folder and Wow! It had been set to “BUILDIN\Users:(OI)(CI)” which means any user can read, write, execute, create, delete do anything inside that folder and it’s subfolders. The ACL rules had OI – Object Inherit and CI – Container Inherit which means all the files in this folder and subfolders have full permissions.

* ![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-21-13_58_29-windows-10-x64-vmware-workstation-1.png?w=500)

  Weak Folder Permission

Since “ScadaAgentSvc.exe” executable is a Windows service, by planting a malicious program with the same name “ScadaAgentSvc.exe” would result in executing the binary as “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” giving highest privileges in a Windows operating system.

This vulnerability can be used to escalate privileges in a Windows operating system locally. For example, an attacker can plant a reverse shell from a low privileged user account and by restarting the computer, the malicious service will be started as “NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM” by giving the attacker full system access to the remote PC.

# [[CVE-2019-17046] Ilch – Content Management System V – 2.1.22 Insecure File Upload, LFI & Remote Code Execution Critical Vulnerability disclosure](https://syhack.wordpress.com/2019/09/29/ilch-content-management-system-v-2-1-22-insecure-file-upload-lfi-remote-code-execution-critical-vulnerability-disclosure/)

[1 Reply](https://syhack.wordpress.com/2019/09/29/ilch-content-management-system-v-2-1-22-insecure-file-upload-lfi-remote-code-execution-critical-vulnerability-disclosure/#comments)

![](https://www.opensourcecms.com/wp-content/uploads/ilch-demo-preview.png)

**Product Owner:** Ilch
– Content Management System

**CVE ID –** CVE-2019-17046 ( <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17046> )

**Type:**  Installable/Customer-Controlled Application

**Application Name**:
ilchCMS 2.1.22

**Severity:** **Critical**

**Authentication:**
Required

**Complexity:** Complex

**Vulnerability Name:**
Insecure File upload and Local file inclusion to remote code execution – Ilch
CMS Admin Modules

**Vulnerability
Explanation:**

**Browsers Verified In:**

Firefox 68.0.2 (64-bit)

**Impact:**

Local File Inclusion – aka LFI – is one of the most common
Web Application vulnerabilities. If conducted successfully, It might allow
attackers to read sensitive information, access configuration files or even
execute system commands remotely.

An application is vulnerable every time a developer uses the
include functions, with an input provided by a user, without validating it. An
attacker could easily exploit such a mistake. The main goals of the attacker
would be:

* An in depth information gathering (user
  enumeration, sensitive files, credentials and more).
* A reverse shell to the target machine.

**Log Poisoning:**

Log Poisoning is a common technique used to gain a reverse
shell from a LFI vulnerability. To make it work an attacker attempts to inject
malicious input to the server log.

As the PHP statement “include” also evaluates the input, an
inclusion of a malformed file would be evaluated too. If we control the
contents of a file available on the vulnerable web application, we could insert
PHP code and load the file over the LFI vulnerability to execute our code.Such
injections were taking place over the server log files. Such files are the
Apache error log, the Access log and more.

**Php info:**

![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/phpinfo.png?w=1024)

As shown, we were able to load the PHPInfo file, meaning
that our code was executed. Let’s now attempt to execute the proper commands
and receive a reverse shell from the target machine.

**For the following Php-oneliner payload to execute system commands:**

<?php echo shell\_exec($\_GET[‘e’].’ 2>&1′); ?>

**LFI: Local File Inclusion
using insecure file upload**

**Insecure file upload –** Allows to add .php extensionin the allowed file section (Media module -> settings -> Allowed File -> php

**url : <http://localhost/cms/Ilch-v2.1.22/index.php/admin/media/settings/index>**

**Ipconfig:**

![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/ipconfig.png?w=1024)

**Reverse shell:**

Using netcat we can gain reverse shell payload.

**Revershell payload
used:**

![](https://syhack.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/revershell.png?w=1024)

Payload – <https://github.com/Dhayalanb/windows-php-reverse-shell.git>

**Remote Code Execution:**Remote code execution is the ability an attacker has to access someone
else’s computing device and make changes, no matter where the device is
geographically located

**By listening on port 1234
we can see that a Admin shell has been received.**

![](https://www.opensourcecms.com/wp-content/uploads/ilch-demo-preview.png)

**Product Owner:** Ilch – Content Management System

CVE ID: CVE-2019-17045 ( <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17045> )

**Type:**  Installable/Customer-Controlled Application

**Application Name**: ilchCMS – 2.1.22 02/01/22

**Application Release** **Date**: 23.05.2019

**Severity:** **High**

**Authentication:**
Required

**Complexity:** Easy

**Vulnerability Name:**
Stored Cross-site scripting – XSS Polyglot (Stored)

**Vulnerability
Explanation:**  An XSS polyglot can be
generally defined as any XSS vector that is executable within various injection
contexts in its raw form.

**Browsers Verified In:**

Firefox 68.0.2 (64-bit)

**Anatomy of the polyglot**

* jaVasCript:: A label in ECMAScript; a URI scheme
  otherwise.
* /\*-/\*`/\*\`/\*’/\*”/\*\*/: A multi-line comment
  in ECMAScript; a literal-breaker sequence.
* (/\* \*/oNcliCk=alert() ): A tangled execution
  zone wrapped in invoking parenthesis!
* //%0D%0A%0d%0a//: A single-line comment in
  ECMAScript; a double-CRLF in HTTP response headers.
* </stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/–!>:
  A sneaky HTML-tag-breaker sequence.
* \x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert()//>\x3e: An
  innocuous svg element.

**Impact:**

Stored XSS allows an attacker to embed a malicious script
into a vulnerable page, which is then executed when a victim views the page.
Reflected cross-site scripting relies on a victim being socially engineered
into clicking on a malicious link, sent via email for example.

**Proof of
Concept:  (Stored Cross site scripting –
XSS Polyglot (Stored))**

**Affected items:** ilchCMS  2.1.22

**Step 1:** Host the application using local web server xampp, install the Ilch CMS as per documentation.

**Step 2: Go to admin
panel**

**Step 3:** Click Modules Tab

**Step 4:** Under the modules click Jobs Tab

**Step 5:** Enter the payload in all input field such as title, text, email id

**Step 6:** Finally click Add – Stored XSS will reflect back on the browser, even after refresh the stored XSS will reflect again.

**Xss Payload used** :

Html Comment:

```
<!--

jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */oNcliCk=alert(1234) )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert(1234)//>\x3e

# [OWASP API Security Top 10 2019](https://syhack.wordpress.com/2019/09/23/owasp-api-security-top-10-2019/)

#### OWASP API Security Top 10 – 2019

| A1 | Broken Object Level Authorization | APIs tend to expose endpoints that handle object identifiers, creating a wide attack surface Level Access Control issue. Object-level authorization checks should be considered in every function that accesses a data source using input from the user. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A2 | Broken Authentication | Authentication mechanisms are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise authentication tokens or to exploit implementation flaws to assume other user’s identities temporarily or permanently. Compromising system’s ability to identify the client/user, compromises API security overall. |
| A3 | Excessive Data Exposure | Looking forward to generic implementations, developers tend to expose all object properties without considering their individual sensitivity, relying on clients to perform the data filtering before displaying it to the user. Without controlling the client’s state, servers receive more-and-more filters which can be abused to gain access to sensitive data. |
| A4 | Lack of Resources & Rate Limiting | Quite often, APIs do not impose any restrictions on the size or number of resources that can be requested by the client/user. Not only can this impact the API server performance, leading to Denial of Service (DoS), but also leaves the door open to authentication flaws such as brute force. |
| A5 | Broken Function Level Authorization | Complex access control policies with different hierarchies, groups, and roles, and an unclear separation between administrative and regular functions, tend to lead to authorization flaws. By exploiting these issues, attackers gain access to other users’ resources and/or administrative functions. |
| A6 | Mass Assignment | Binding client provided data (e.g., JSON) to data models, without proper properties filtering based on a whitelist, usually lead to Mass Assignment. Either guessing objects properties, exploring other API endpoints, reading the documentation, or providing additional object properties in request payloads, allows attackers to modify object properties they are not supposed to. |
| A7 | Security Misconfiguration | Security misconfiguration is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad-hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, unnecessary HTTP methods, permissive Cross-Origin resource sharing (CORS), and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. |
| A8 | Injection | Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection, etc. occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s malicious data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization. |
| A9 | Improper Assets Management | APIs tend to expose more endpoints than traditional web applications, making proper and updated documentation highly important. Proper hosts and deployed API versions inventory also play an important role to mitigate issues such as deprecated API versions and exposed debug endpoints. |
| A10 | Insufficient Logging & Monitoring | Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems to tamper with, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies demonstrate the time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring. |
