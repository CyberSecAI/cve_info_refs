- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when displaying it in the client list, leading to stored XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The user-supplied input for the account name is not properly encoded/sanitized before being displayed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of an administrator's browser session when they view the client list, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or unauthorized actions performed on the application on behalf of the administrator.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious client user modifies their account name to include a malicious JavaScript payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a client user account and be able to modify their username to inject the malicious payload. The victim needs to be an administrator user who views the client list where the malicious payload is rendered.
