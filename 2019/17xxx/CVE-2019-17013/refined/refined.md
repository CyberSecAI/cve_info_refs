Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17013:

**CVE-2019-17013: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 71**

*   **Root Cause:** This CVE is a collection of multiple memory safety bugs identified in Firefox 70. The specific root causes for each bug vary, but all lead to memory corruption.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The identified weaknesses are related to general memory safety issues such as use-after-free, heap-use-after-free, and other forms of memory corruption.
    *   Specifically mentioned in the associated bug list:
        *   `AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free [@ Id] with READ of size 4 through [@ mozilla::PBenchmarkStorageChild::SendPut]`
        *   `Crash in [@ mozilla::net::PACResolver::Notify]`
         *   `AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free [@ nsAtomTable::Atomize] with WRITE of size 8 through [@ selectors::parser::parse_one_simple_selector]`
        *   `Possible use of uninitialized memory in PeerConnectionImpl::GetFingerprint`
        *   `nsReferencedElement is not notified for elements that are removed through document.open()`
        *    `Crash [@ js::DebugScript::decrementGeneratorObserverCount] or Assertion failure: script->hasDebugScript(), at debugger/DebugScript.cpp:44`
        *   `AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free [@ InvokeAsync<(lambda at dom/media/ipc/RemoteMediaDataDecoder.cpp:59:22)>] with READ of size 8`
        *  `AddressSanitizer: SEGV ... in _$LT$servo_arc..RawOffsetArc$LT$T$GT$$u20$as$u20$core..ops..drop..Drop$GT$::drop::hf087ada73012f773`
        *   `Assertion failure: aPos->GetOriginalOffset() < aOriginalEnd (character outside string), at /builds/worker/workspace/build/src/layout/generic/nsTextFrame.cpp:3290`

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The memory corruption could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain control of the affected system. The severity is rated as high.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vectors depend on the specific memory safety bug. In general, they involve triggering the vulnerable code paths within Firefox.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to be able to trigger the specific code paths to cause memory corruption. This would likely require crafting specific web content or exploiting other vulnerabilities that can interact with the vulnerable code.
