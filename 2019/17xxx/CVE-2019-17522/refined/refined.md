Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "SITE NAME" field. Specifically, HTML characters are not encoded or removed before being stored in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is injected into the "SITE NAME" field and stored in the database. This payload is executed when a user accesses the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the "SITE NAME". This code would then execute in the browsers of users who visit the site, enabling the attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the website
    - Perform other actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "SITE NAME" input field, likely found in the administrative panel or site settings of HotaruCMS v1.7.2.
- An attacker would enter a malicious payload as the site name, which will then be stored in the database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the privileges to modify the site's name in the HotaruCMS admin panel. This would usually require being logged in as an administrator or having sufficient privileges.
- The attacker could also potentially exploit this by compromising an administrator account.
- The attack doesn't require any other interaction from other users than simply accessing the website and triggering the payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided GitHub issue report clearly shows the attacker using the payload `"><script>alert(1)</script>` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
- The screenshots in the issue report also show the successful execution of the injected script.
- The `install_tables.php` file does not provide additional useful information related to the vulnerability
