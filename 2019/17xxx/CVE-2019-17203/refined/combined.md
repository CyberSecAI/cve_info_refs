## Description

![@lebik](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15812611?u=2c6a4a4469195a5f758863b4834196b696b14c83&v=4&size=48)[lebik](https://github.com/lebik)opened [on Sep 30, 2019](https://github.com/nilsteampassnet/TeamPass/issues/2690#issue-500225821)
### Steps to reproduce

1. Add a new item to any folder, set a password with XSS payload:

```
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>

```

2. Open Search Page, find and click at the item
3. That's all.

   The XSS payload will be triggered.

   In fact, it will be triggered an infinite number of times if you click on the show password icon.
