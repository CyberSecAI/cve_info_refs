  "cve": "CVE-2019-17140",
  "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Foxit PhantomPDF. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the OnFocus event. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "affected_versions": [
    "Foxit PhantomPDF 8.3.11 and earlier",
    "Foxit PhantomPDF 9.7.3 and earlier"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation when handling the OnFocus event within Foxit PhantomPDF. Specifically, the application fails to verify the existence of a specific object before attempting to perform operations on it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-After-Free"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary Code Execution",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves a remote attacker who can trigger the vulnerability by luring the user to visit a malicious page or open a malicious PDF file, which contains a crafted signature field with a malicious OnFocus event handler.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious PDF file, or lure the user to a malicious webpage, in order to trigger the vulnerability. User interaction, such as opening a crafted PDF document, is required.",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is related to the handling of signature fields and the OnFocus event within the application. The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of validation of the existence of an object before performing operations on it. An attacker can exploit this by creating a crafted PDF document or by tricking a user into visiting a malicious webpage that triggers the vulnerability within the Foxit software."
