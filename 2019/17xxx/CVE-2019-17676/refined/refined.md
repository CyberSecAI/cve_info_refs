- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks CSRF protection on the `doSaveSetup` action in `admin/index.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can add a new administrator user to the system by tricking a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can create a malicious HTML page or link, which, when accessed by a logged-in administrator, submits a form to the vulnerable `doSaveSetup` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick an already logged-in administrator to visit a crafted webpage or click a malicious link.
