Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17104:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of unsecured cookies within the Centreon-VM application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsecured Cookies:** The application uses cookies that are not properly secured, likely missing attributes such as `Secure` and `HttpOnly`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The use of unsecured cookies could allow attackers to intercept or manipulate session cookies, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information.
- This vulnerability can potentially enable session hijacking or other related attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks:** Attackers positioned on the network path can intercept unencrypted cookie data.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks:** If the application is vulnerable to XSS, an attacker could potentially steal cookies using JavaScript.
- **Network eavesdropping:** An attacker on the same network segment can potentially eavesdrop on unencrypted network traffic, including cookie data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between a user's browser and the Centreon-VM server. This could be achieved through:
   - Local network access.
   - Compromise of network infrastructure (e.g., routers, switches).
   - MitM attacks on public networks.
   - Successful execution of XSS attacks.

**Additional Information**
- This vulnerability was found in Centreon-VM, and was reported as not yet fixed at the time of the advisory.
