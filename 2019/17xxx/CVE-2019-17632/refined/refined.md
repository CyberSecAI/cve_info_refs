Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-17632:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The `ErrorHandler` in Eclipse Jetty generates `text/html` or `text/json` responses that include stack traces of unhandled errors. The exception messages within these stack traces are not properly escaped.
*   **Affected Versions:** Eclipse Jetty versions 9.4.21.v20190926, 9.4.22.v20191022, and 9.4.23.v20191118.
*   **Fixed Version:** 9.4.24.v20191120
*   **Attack Vector:** A skilled attacker could inject malicious code into an exception message. When the unhandled error occurs, the injected code is rendered in the error page, leading to XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Upgrade to version 9.4.24.v20191120 or later.
    *   Disable stack traces in the generic `ErrorHandler`. This can be done at both the Server level (for non-context errors) and the WebAppContext level (for web application-specific errors).
*   **CWE:** CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
*   **Discoverers:** Jon Are Rakv√•g and Erlend Leiknes.

The Red Hat Bugzilla entry indicates that the bug was closed with a resolution of "WONTFIX" for the `Security Response` product, suggesting it was addressed elsewhere (likely in the individual component, Jetty).
