==EXTRACTED INFO==
- **Vulnerability:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
- **Root Cause:** The XML content type entity deserializer is not configured to deny the resolution of external entities. XML data is parsed by insecurely configured software components.
- **Affected Versions:** Apache Olingo OData 4.x.x to 4.6.x
- **Unaffected Versions:** Olingo OData 4.7.0, Olingo OData 2.0 (with XXE protection since 1.1.0-RC01)
- **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with content type "application/xml" containing a crafted XML payload with an external entity.
- **Impact:** Exploitation can lead to reading arbitrary files on the server. The provided example demonstrates reading the /etc/passwd file.
- **Exploitability:** Remotely exploitable.
- **Attacker Requirements:** Ability to send HTTP requests to the server.
- **Technical Details:**
  - The vulnerability lies in `org.apache.olingo.server.core.deserializer.xml.ODataXmlDeserializer.java`.
  - The `XMLInputFactory` is not configured to prevent external entity resolution.
- **Mitigation:**
  - Configure the `XMLInputFactory` to disable DTD support and external entity resolution:
    ```java
    FACTORY.setProperty(XMLInputFactory.SUPPORT_DTD, false);
    FACTORY.setProperty("javax.xml.stream.isSupportingExternalEntities", false);
    ```
