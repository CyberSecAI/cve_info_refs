The provided content discusses a successful SQL injection attack against Netgear SRX5308 and FVS318Gv2 firewalls.

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a failure to sanitize user input in the login form, specifically when handling usernames and passwords. This allowed for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw in the login process, where user-supplied data is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows attackers to manipulate database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized User Creation:** Attackers successfully injected a new administrative user named 'app' into the device's user database.
*   **Device Access:** This newly created user provided the attacker with administrative access to the firewall device.
*   **Potential Data Breach:** While the content does not confirm data exfiltration, the successful injection and access could have enabled the attacker to access sensitive information.
*   **Device Control:** The attacker could modify device configuration, network settings and potentially disrupt network services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Form:** The attack vector is the device's login form. The attacker injected malicious SQL code within the username field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the firewall's login interface, likely through the WAN interface if remote access is enabled or through LAN if that is exposed.
*   **Basic SQL Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of SQL to craft the injection payload.
*   **No Authentication Initially Required:** The vulnerability allows for injection via the login form; it does not rely on prior access.

**Additional Information**

*   The attack involves using the username field to inject SQL code, as seen in the logs: `myxxxx';INSERT INTO USERDBUsers...`
*   The attacker added the user 'app' and logged in with administrative privileges, then attempted to remove the 'app' user through another SQL injection attempt.
*   The vulnerability is present in older Netgear devices like the SRX5308 and FVS318Gv2 which are out of support.
*   The issue is described as an "old school DB injection", highlighting the lack of basic security practices such as input sanitization.
