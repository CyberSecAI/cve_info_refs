The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in MetInfo CMS version 7.0.0 beta.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application uses `gpc` to filter form variables initially.
- It then uses a function called `get_sql` for secondary filtering. However, `get_sql` escapes single quotes, which can be bypassed through the injection point.
**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `title` field within a multipart form POST request.
- Bypassing of filtering mechanism: The `get_sql` function escapes single quotes, but the SQL query is vulnerable to injection.
**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
- This could lead to data breaches, modification, or deletion of data, and potentially full server compromise.
**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited via a multipart POST request containing the vulnerable `title` parameter.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send a POST request to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated. This issue is in the admin panel.
- Basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques, specifically in bypassing single quote escaping is needed to exploit this vulnerability.
