The provided content relates to CVE-2019-17630.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization when uploading and processing files. Specifically, the filename of an uploaded image is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the filename.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper sanitization of user-supplied input (filename) during file upload.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- Potential for session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- The XSS payload gets executed when the page is refreshed and on the edit page, showing persistence of the attack.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the CMS Made Simple admin panel. An authenticated attacker with privileges to add news articles can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a specially crafted image file with a malicious filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the CMS Made Simple application, specifically the ability to create news articles.
- The attacker must be able to upload files in the "News > Add Article" section.
- The attacker must be able to rename the file with a payload in order to execute the script.

**Technical Details:**
The vulnerability is demonstrated by:
1.  Logging in to the CMS with admin credentials.
2.  Navigating to Content > News > Add Article.
3.  Creating an image in JPG format.
4.  Renaming the image file to include an XSS payload, such as `<IMG src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>.jpg`.
5.  Uploading the renamed file when creating a new article.
6.  The XSS payload executes after refreshing the page or when editing the article.
