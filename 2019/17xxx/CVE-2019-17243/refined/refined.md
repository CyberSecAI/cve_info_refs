{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of JPEG_LS files within the IrfanView software. Specifically, the address used to read data is controlled by a faulting address which leads to a code flow control vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Data from a Faulting Address is used to control Code Flow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially control the program's execution flow by manipulating the data read from a crafted JPEG_LS file, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted JPEG_LS file."
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious JPEG_LS file and have the victim open it using IrfanView 4.53. This is a local attack scenario."
