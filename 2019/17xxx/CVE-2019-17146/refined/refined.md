## Analysis of CVE-2019-17146

The provided content describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the D-Link DCS-960L camera, identified as CVE-2019-17146.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper validation of the length of user-supplied data in the `SOAPAction` request header within the HNAP service. The process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Stack-based buffer overflow.
*   Lack of authentication required for exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote code execution with the privileges of the `admin` user.
*   Device malfunction.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending a crafted `SOAPAction` request header to the HNAP service on TCP port 80. The HNAP service listens on TCP port 80 by default.
*   The attack can be performed from the LAN-side (in home).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Network access to the affected device on the LAN.
*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the device.

**Affected Products and Fixes:**

*   DCS-960L (Hardware Revision A): Affected firmware v1.07.102 and older, fixed in v1.09.
*   DCS-935L (All Ax Hardware Revisions): Affected firmware v1.12.101 and older, fixed in v1.13.01.
