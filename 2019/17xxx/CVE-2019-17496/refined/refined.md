The provided content is related to CVE-2019-17496.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper HTML escaping in the `AdminTable.js` component when displaying success or error messages after deleting an item. The item name, which is obtained from a HTML attribute of a table row, was not being sanitized before being inserted into the message.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, an unescaped name variable was being passed to the `Craft.cp.displayNotice` and `Craft.cp.displayError` functions, which would render this content within the DOM.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via the item's name attribute, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the user's browser. This could result in session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker would need to be able to control the `name` attribute of a table row that is displayed in the Craft CMS admin panel. This could potentially be achieved through various means such as:
- Modifying data stored in the database.
- Manipulating input fields in a way that influences how table rows are rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to have sufficient privileges to modify the data or structure that results in a crafted value in the name attribute within the `AdminTable.js` component. This would likely require at least some level of access to the Craft CMS backend.
