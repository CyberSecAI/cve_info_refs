- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when converting DXF files to PDF, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered when converting a malicious DXF file to PDF. This requires user interaction, either by visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious DXF file. User interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
