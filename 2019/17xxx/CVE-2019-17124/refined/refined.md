      "source": "hessandrew/CVE-2019-17124",
      "description": "KRAMER VIAware 2.5.0719.1034 - Remote Code Execution",
       "rootCause": "The web service used to make the VIAapp software available to guests does not correctly check sessions, allowing anonymous users to access admin-only pages. The `rev` variable, modifiable on the client side, allows arbitrary file writes.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate Session Validation",
        "Arbitrary File Write"
      ],
       "impact": "Remote code execution as SYSTEM.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "Accessing the vulnerable web service from the external network",
           "Modifying the `rev` parameter in a request to the vulnerable web service.",
             "Writing an exploit script to a web-accessible directory, such as the apache cgi-bin folder.",
           "Executing the arbitrary code by visiting the newly created script."
        ],
         "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web service. No authentication is required due to the lack of session validation. They must be able to modify the `rev` parameter.",
      "additionalDetails": "The Apache service, which runs the web service, runs under the SYSTEM context. Therefore, any code executed will also run with SYSTEM privileges."
