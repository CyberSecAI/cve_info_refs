  "CVE-2019-17180": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The Steam Client Service improperly handles paths containing \"\\..\", allowing an attacker to write arbitrary content to a file by manipulating the service's log file path through a registry modification and NTFS reparse point redirection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper path handling and normalization in the Steam Client Service.",
        "Insecure permissions on registry keys, allowing modification by non-admin users.",
		"Lack of proper input sanitization/validation when generating log file paths"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary file write as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM, leading to potential privilege escalation, denial of service, and redirection of user in the internet",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Modifying the Steam client's registry entry for InstallPath.",
		"Creating a NTFS reparse point to redirect the log file path."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "Ability to modify registry values for the Steam client (typically, users have write access to the related registry key) and the ability to create NTFS reparse points. No admin privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability."
