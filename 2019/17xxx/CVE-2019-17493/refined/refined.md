The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the jnoj project, including file upload and XSS issues.

**1. Arbitrary File Upload**
   - **Root Cause:** The `actionTests` function in `ProblemController` directly uses user-provided file names and paths without validation when moving uploaded files, resulting in arbitrary file upload vulnerability.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of sanitization and validation of user-provided input, specifically the file name and path.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, which can be executed on the server leading to Remote Code Execution.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a file to the `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/tests` endpoint.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, requiring knowledge of the application's URL structure and parameters.

**2. Stored XSS in Problem Creation**
   - **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input when creating a problem title.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of sanitization of user input before storing in the database.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can inject JavaScript code into the title field, which executes when other users view the problem list.
   - **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/create` with malicious JavaScript code in the `Problem[title]` parameter.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  An attacker needs to access the problem creation interface in the web application and inject the payload during creation.

**3. Stored XSS in Problem Details Page**
    - **Root Cause:** Insecure handling of user-provided input during the problem update process. Although the frontend may attempt to sanitize data, the backend does not enforce proper input sanitization, allowing direct injection of HTML tags and JavaScript code by modifying POST parameters.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Inadequate sanitization of user input in multiple fields when updating problem details. The application relies on frontend sanitization, which is bypassed by modifying the POST data. The backend filter for the `hint` parameter can be bypassed using `&nbsp;`
    - **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into various problem fields such as title, description, input, output, sample inputs, sample outputs and hint. This code will execute when users view the problem details page.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Crafting an HTTP POST request to `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/update` with malicious JavaScript in parameters like `Problem[title]`, `Problem[description]`, etc.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker must be able to access the problem update interface in the web application and intercept the request to modify parameters.

**4. Stored XSS in Admin Panel Problem Creation**
    - **Root Cause:**  Similar to the front-end, the admin panel for problem creation does not properly sanitize input leading to XSS.
    - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of sanitization of user-controlled input in `Problem[title]`, `Problem[sample_input]` and `Problem[sample_output]` fields during problem creation in the admin panel.
    - **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with access to the admin panel can inject JavaScript code that executes when other users view the problem within the admin panel.
    - **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/jnoj/web/admin/problem/create` with malicious JavaScript code in relevant parameters.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user.

**5. Stored XSS in Admin Settings**
   - **Root Cause:** The application stores unsanitized user-provided input in admin settings.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** No input sanitization of user-provided data in admin settings leading to persistent XSS.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers with admin access can inject malicious JavaScript code into admin settings, which will be executed on every page view for all users who can see the affected setting.
    - **Attack Vectors:**  Admin injects malicious code to the application settings.
    - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Attacker needs to be an authenticated admin user.
