Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-17598:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The Play-WS client, when configured to use an authenticated proxy server, incorrectly sends HTTP CONNECT requests to the target host including the proxy authentication headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Inclusion of Authorization headers in HTTP CONNECT requests:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `Authorization` header, which contains the proxy credentials (typically base64 encoded username and password for Basic Auth), is sent not only to the proxy but also to the target host during an HTTP CONNECT request.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Exposure of proxy credentials:**  An attacker monitoring traffic to the target host or controlling the target host can intercept the HTTP CONNECT request and extract the base64 encoded proxy username and password from the `Authorization` header. This allows the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the proxy server.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker who can intercept the traffic between the Play-WS client and the target host can extract the Authorization header.
- **Compromised target host:** If the target host is compromised, the attacker controlling the target can extract the `Authorization` header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or monitor the HTTP CONNECT traffic between the Play-WS client and the target host or control the target host.
- The targeted application must use Play-WS with a configured authenticated proxy.
- The proxy authentication must be done with Basic Authentication, where credentials are sent in the `Authorization` header as base64 encoded.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Play Framework versions 2.6.0 to 2.6.23 and all 2.5.x versions.
- The fix was released in Play 2.6.24.
- Play 2.7.x is not affected.
- There is no fix for Play 2.5.x versions due to end of support.
- The CVSS score is 3.4, which indicates a low severity vulnerability.
