    "source": "bugzilla.mozilla.org_6a8ff834_20250121_023800.html",
    "vulnerability": "CSP bypass using object tag when script-src 'none' is specified",
    "description": "A Content-Security-Policy that blocks in-line scripts could be bypassed using an object tag to execute JavaScript in the protected document (cross-site scripting). This is a separate bypass from CVE-2019-17000. Note: This flaw only affected Firefox 69 and was not present in earlier versions.",
    "root_cause": "The Content Security Policy (CSP) was not being correctly applied to `<object>` tags, allowing them to bypass the `script-src 'none'` directive.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect CSP implementation for `<object>` tags",
      "Failure to prevent execution of javascript: URLs within `<object>` tags",
       "Failure to prevent execution of data:text/html URLs within `<object>` tags"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the protected document, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and cookie theft.",
    "attack_vector": "A malicious webpage can inject an `<object>` tag with a `data` attribute set to `javascript:` or `data:text/html` containing malicious JavaScript. If the page has a CSP with `script-src 'none'`, the script should not execute, but due to the bug, the javascript will execute.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML into a page that has the vulnerable CSP defined (e.g., through a stored XSS or other similar vulnerability).",
    "affected_versions": "Firefox 69",
     "fix_versions": [ "Firefox 70", "Firefox 71" ]

    "source": "bugzilla.mozilla.org_80beb310_20250121_003035.html",
    "vulnerability": "upgrade-insecure-requests was not being honored for links dragged and dropped",
     "description": "If `upgrade-insecure-requests` was specified in the Content Security Policy, and a link was dragged and dropped from that page, the link was not upgraded to https.",
    "root_cause": "The `upgrade-insecure-requests` directive of the Content Security Policy was not being applied when links were dragged and dropped.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Failure to correctly apply `upgrade-insecure-requests` CSP directive on dragged links",
      "Missing context/state when performing a drag and drop operation."
    ],
    "impact": "A drag and dropped link from a secure page that specifies `upgrade-insecure-requests` in the CSP might load through http instead of upgrading to https, resulting in potential man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker could host a website with `upgrade-insecure-requests` in the CSP, and have a user drag and drop a link to a page from the website. If the link is an HTTP URL it would load as HTTP instead of HTTPS.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the user drag and drop a link from a compromised web page.",
    "affected_versions": "Firefox before 70",
    "fix_versions": [
      "Firefox 70"
