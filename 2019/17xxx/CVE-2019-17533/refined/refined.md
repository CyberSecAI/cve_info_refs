Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17533:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability exists in the `Mat_VarReadNextInfo4` function within `mat4.c` of the `libmatio` library. The vulnerability occurs in the `strdup_vprintf` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer over-read. This means that the program attempts to read data beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap, potentially leading to reading sensitive data or causing a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap-based buffer over-read could lead to information disclosure by potentially revealing sensitive data from the heap memory. It may also lead to a denial of service by causing the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when reading specifically crafted Matlab MAT files. The attacker needs to provide a malicious MAT file to trigger the vulnerable code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious MAT file to the `libmatio` library. This could be through user interaction or by tricking an application into loading the file.
- The attacker needs no specific privileges on the system.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `Mat_VarReadNextInfo4` function and related to how string data is handled during reading MAT file structures.
- The fix is present in commit `651a8e28099edb5fbb9e4e1d4d3238848f446c9a` which aims to "Avoid uninitialized memory". This commit likely fixes the issue causing the over-read.
- The Debian LTS advisory indicates that this vulnerability was fixed in `libmatio` version `1.5.2-3+deb8u1` for Debian 8 "Jessie".
