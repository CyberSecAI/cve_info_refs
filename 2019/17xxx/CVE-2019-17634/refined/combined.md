Information regarding how the project team can deal with the vulnerability is documented in the Eclipse Project Handbook.  <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c2)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-12-18 14:07:19 EST  ``` Krum, I need a response from the project team, please. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c3)  Krum Tsvetkov [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-12-20 08:03:12 EST  ``` Hi Wayne, appologies for the delay. I have reviewed the documentation, but am still not quite sure what to do. My thoughts on the issues so far: - first of all - yes, that is an issue. In MAT we extract certain values (e.g. Strings' values, Thread names, etc...) out of the heapdump and we also have some functionality to render the analysis as HTML. We've overlooked that in such case we have to take care to do proper escaping to avoid the described attack - second, I think it is important to get an estimate of how critical the issue is/what its priority is. My personal estimate is that the risk is low. I can think of the following attach scenarios:   -- someone creates a crafted heap dump and sends it to someone else for analysis, e.g. as part of a support ticket / question   -- the owner of a service analyses a crash of the service and in the heap dumps there are crafted Strings  The part I didn't figure out in the linked document:  - how can we come up to an estimation of the priority  - what disclosure process to use (silent or not)  - is the project team obliged to fix the issues in a certain timeframe  - what exactly is expected from the project team as a statement (is this write-up ok?), etc...  Are these all up to the project team to decide?  I personally won't be able to spend any time on MAT in the next couple of weeks. I will add Andrew Johnson to CC as he is the one doing 90% of the code changes recently. And I will add to CC also Kevin Grigorenko - the other committer who has recently done changes to MAT. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c4)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-12-20 13:31:21 EST  ``` We need to: 1. find the locations to escape HTML inserts 2. decide on an escaping technique   a. own code. If simple - possibility of errors if complex.  b. library code. Library code may need third-party code approval, so could we find code already in Eclipse or Orbit.  c. Rewrite using HTML document generation APIs - bigger MAT changes and need approved third-party code. 3. decide how we ship the fix  a. Version 1.10 - as we have already made API changes since 1.9.1, but we need to complete those big changes (multi-threaded parsing, OQL enhancements) including documentation before we are ready to ship.  b. Version 1.9.2 - but we should have to branch the code to the 1.9.1 point and fix in both master and 1.9.2, which is more work. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c5)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-12-22 05:58:55 EST  ``` 1.The main areas to change are:  a. LeakHunterQuery.java  b. ComponentReportQuery.java  c. also HTMLPieChartRenderer for any data derived from the dump, including thread names, class loader names. We also need to consider actual class names, because although Java class names aren't risky the HPROF format allows any text. Also consider duplicate char arrays in the component report. This is a particular problem as although the application may be trustworthy it may end up processing itself untrusted character data which will get into the HPROF dump. 2.Our HTMLUtils.escapeText() routine should be sufficient for body text. (Double-quote also needs to be escaped for attributes). 3.I have some prototype changes, but don't know how to share them yet. Gerrit has a private option but some people don't recommend it for security fixes: <https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/intro-user.html#security-fixes> The other idea is to attach it here as a patch. Eventually it will have to go into Gerrit and be built and the changes will be more visible. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c6)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-12-26 04:34:20 EST  ``` Created [attachment 281335](attachment.cgi?id=281335&action=diff "Escaping HTML in TextResult and some HTML tests") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=281335&action=edit "Escaping HTML in TextResult and some HTML tests") Escaping HTML in TextResult and some HTML tests  I have escaped all the thread names, class names, class loader names and char[] values that I can see in HTML results. The tests improve HTML validity. They won't spot unescaped class names etc. as they don't normally contain troublesome characters, but may spot unmatched tags and some double escaping. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c7)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-01-14 03:35:27 EST  ``` New Gerrit change created: <https://git.eclipse.org/r/155815> ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=552542#c8)  Eclipse Genie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-01-14 03:39:44 EST  ``` Gerrit change <https://git.eclipse.org/r/155815> was merged to [1.9.x].
