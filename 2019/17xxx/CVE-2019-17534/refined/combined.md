[@jcupitt](https://github.com/jcupitt) Is it correct that the issue (which got assigned [CVE-2019-17534](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4hqm-7w7w-5w4r "CVE-2019-17534"), cf <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=16796>) only ever was present in a non-tagged version, introduced with the refactoring around [5749d60...f6cc2a9](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/compare/5749d60425c0e58346da0ba17398217f7c576ce8...f6cc2a9055809f9cdda2eec6ab306b8156bbf8d5)? So no released/tagged version was ever affected?

Yes, I think that's correct.

This commit introduced the bug on 26 August to git master:

[25e4577#diff-0ecc7d6a66fc223548212a9bac2745c9](https://github.com/libvips/libvips/commit/25e457736173369dcb0f7c09d07af68aedbdc175#diff-0ecc7d6a66fc223548212a9bac2745c9)

oss-fuzz found the bug that night, and this commit we are commenting on fixed it on 27 August. It was never formally released.

The CVE was created automatically. I don't think anyone was affected.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:
