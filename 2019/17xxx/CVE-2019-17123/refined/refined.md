{
  "CVE-2019-17123": {
    "Description": "Email Header Injection vulnerability in the eGain Web API that allows attackers to send specially crafted emails through otherwise trusted Mail Servers.",
    "Root cause": "The eGain Web API does not properly sanitize user input, specifically the `fromName` parameter in the `/system/ws/v11/ss/email` API endpoint.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Email Header Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers can spoof emails as organization employees, set unintended Subjects, send attachments, and potentially circumvent email filters and protections. This can be used for phishing attacks.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a POST request to the `/system/ws/v11/ss/email` endpoint with a crafted `fromName` parameter containing Carriage Return (`0x0D`) and Line Feed (`0x0A`) bytes.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable eGain Web API endpoint and be able to send HTTP requests. They also need a working understanding of HTTP, JSON, and email header structure. The attacker also must be able to enumerate portal IDs."
