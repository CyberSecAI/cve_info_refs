# Arbitrary file read vulnerability (Only working on Windows os)

**Date: 26 September 2019** .

**Author: Woowon Kang ([@wooeong2](https://github.com/wooeong2)) / Juno Im ([@junorouse](https://twitter.com/junorouse)) from Theori**

# Summary

Attacker can read arbitrary files on webpagetest servers running on Windows OS.

# Trigger / Exploit

* <https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest/blob/master/www/getfile.php#L9>

```
    $file = $_REQUEST['file'];
    if (preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+\.(?P<ext>png|jpg|txt|zip|csv|mp4)/i', $file, $matches)) {
```

Rules does not have `$` symbol, attacker can bypass with `a.jpg\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\{Arbitrary File}`.

Windows OS ignores not existing folder

# Recommendation / Patch

```
- if (preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+\.(?P<ext>png|jpg|txt|zip|csv|mp4)/i', $file, $matches)) {
+ if (preg_match('/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+\.(?P<ext>png|jpg|txt|zip|csv|mp4)$/i', $file, $matches)) {
```

Sorry, something went wrong.
