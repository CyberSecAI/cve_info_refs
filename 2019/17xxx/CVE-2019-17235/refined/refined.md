The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the WordPress IgniteUp/Coming Soon and Maintenance Mode plugin, specifically version 3.4 and below. CVE-2019-17235 is one of the CVEs associated with the described vulnerabilities.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The plugin fails to properly sanitize and validate user inputs in several functions, leading to various vulnerabilities.
*   **Missing Access Control:** Some functions are accessible without proper authentication or capability checks, allowing unauthenticated users to perform administrative actions.
*   **Lack of Security Nonces:** Some actions lack security nonces, making them vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The `deleteTemplate` function allows any user to delete arbitrary files and folders on the website by manipulating the `$_POST['delete_template']` parameter.
*   **HTML Injection in Email Messages:** The contact form does not sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious HTML code into emails sent from the contact form, potentially leading to phishing attacks.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The contact form is also vulnerable to CSRF attacks, where an attacker could trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions.
*   **Stored XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The plugin does not validate the `$_REQUEST['cs_name']` in the `subscribeEmail` function, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code which is then stored and executed when the admin views the subscriber list.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The `createCsvFile` and `createBccFile` functions expose subscriber information (email addresses) without proper authorization, allowing unauthenticated users to download this data.
*   **Unauthorized actions:** The `removeSubscribers` and `activateTemplate` functions can be accessed by unauthorized users to delete subscribers or switch the plugin's template.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Complete destruction of the website and its data.
*   **HTML Injection in Email Messages:** Phishing attacks, credential theft, or delivery of malware through malicious links embedded in emails.
*   **CSRF:** Unauthorized actions performed by the administrator.
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious code execution in the admin panel leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or further attacks.
*  **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of subscriber email addresses.
* **Unauthorized actions:** Deletion of subscriber data and switching of the plugin's template.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests:** For arbitrary file deletion via the `deleteTemplate` function.
*   **WordPress AJAX API:** For HTML injection/CSRF via the `sendContactForm` function, XSS via the `subscribeEmail` function.
*   **HTTP GET requests:** For Information disclosure via `createCsvFile` and `createBccFile` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated:** Most of the identified vulnerabilities can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Ability to make HTTP POST and GET requests, craft HTML code and inject it into parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were reported to the WordPress.org team, and a patched version (3.4.1) was released.
* The plugin has been closed on March 9, 2022 due to a security issue.
