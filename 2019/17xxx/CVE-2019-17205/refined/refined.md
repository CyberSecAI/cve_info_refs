- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input during login attempts, specifically the username field.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The provided username (which contains the XSS payload) is stored in the "Failed Logins" log without proper sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** When an administrator views the "Failed Logins" log, the stored XSS payload will be executed in their browser. This could lead to the administrator's session being hijacked, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the TeamPass application.
- **Attack vectors:** By attempting to login with a malicious username containing an XSS payload, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to attempt a login and provide a username with the malicious XSS payload. No specific privileges are required, this can be done by anyone. The attacker does not need any initial access to the application.
