# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

                 CVE-2023-29450 CVE-2023-29451 CVE-2023-29454 CVE-2023-29455
                 CVE-2023-29456 CVE-2023-29457
Debian Bug     : 1026847

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in zabbix, a network
monitoring solution, potentially allowing to crash the server, information
disclosure or Cross-Site-Scripting attacks.

Important Notices:
To mitigate CVE-2019-17382, on existing installations, the guest account
needs to be manually disabled, for example by disabling the the "Guest
group" in the UI:
   Administration -> User groups -> Guests -> Untick Enabled

This update also fixes a regression with CVE-2022-35229, which broke the
possiblity to edit and add discovery rules in the UI.

CVE-2013-7484

    Zabbix before version 4.4.0alpha2 stores credentials in the "users"
    table with the password hash stored as a MD5 hash, which is a known
    insecure hashing method. Furthermore, no salt is used with the hash.

CVE-2019-17382 (Disputed, not seen by upstream as not a security issue)

    An issue was discovered in
    zabbix.php?action=dashboard.view&dashboardid=1 in Zabbix through
    4.4. An attacker can bypass the login page and access the dashboard
    page, and then create a Dashboard, Report, Screen, or Map without
    any Username/Password (i.e., anonymously). All created elements
    (Dashboard/Report/Screen/Map) are accessible by other users and by
    an admin.

CVE-2022-35229

    An authenticated user can create a link with reflected
    Javascript code inside it for the discovery page and send it to
    other users. The payload can be executed only with a known CSRF
    token value of the victim, which is changed periodically and is
    difficult to predict.

CVE-2022-43515

    Zabbix Frontend provides a feature that allows admins to
    maintain the installation and ensure that only certain IP addresses
    can access it. In this way, any user will not be able to access the
    Zabbix Frontend while it is being maintained and possible sensitive
    data will be prevented from being disclosed. An attacker can bypass
    this protection and access the instance using IP address not listed
    in the defined range.

CVE-2023-29450

    JavaScript pre-processing can be used by the attacker to gain
    access to the file system (read-only access on behalf of user
    "zabbix") on the Zabbix Server or Zabbix Proxy, potentially leading
    to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

CVE-2023-29451

    Specially crafted string can cause a buffer overrun in the JSON
    parser library leading to a crash of the Zabbix Server or a Zabbix
    Proxy.

CVE-2023-29454

    A Stored or persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    was found on “Users” section in “Media” tab in “Send to” form field.
    When new media is created with malicious code included into field
    “Send to” then it will execute when editing the same media.

CVE-2023-29455

    A Reflected XSS attacks, also known as non-persistent attacks, was
    found where an attacker can pass malicious code as GET request to
    graph.php and system will save it and will execute when current
    graph page is opened.

CVE-2023-29456

    URL validation scheme receives input from a user and then parses
    it to identify its various components. The validation scheme can
    ensure that all URL components comply with internet standards.

CVE-2023-29457

    A Reflected XSS attacks, also known as non-persistent attacks, was
    found where XSS session cookies could be revealed, enabling a
