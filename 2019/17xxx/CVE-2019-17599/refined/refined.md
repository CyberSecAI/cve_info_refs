Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-17599

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It occurs due to insufficient sanitization of the `quiz_id` parameter passed through the URL's GET request. Specifically, the value from $_GET['quiz_id'] is directly echoed into a hidden input field without proper encoding or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization for the `quiz_id` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code through the URL, which is then reflected back to the user within the HTML content.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The plugin fails to validate and encode the `quiz_id` parameter before using it in the HTML context, leading to the XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the administrator or other users.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the content of the admin page, potentially leading to phishing or misinformation.
- **Malware Distribution:** Attackers could use the XSS to redirect the victim to malicious websites and infect the user with malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the payload in the `quiz_id` parameter and sends it to the victim (typically an administrator).
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker may use social engineering tactics to entice the administrator to click the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with JavaScript payload in the `quiz_id` parameter.
- **Social Engineering (Optional):** The attacker may need social engineering skills to get a victim to click the URL.
- **Target Admin Account:** The victim must be a logged-in WordPress administrator for the XSS to be successfully executed.

**Technical Details**
- Vulnerable file: `/quiz-master-next/php/admin/quiz-options-page.php` line 162.
- Vulnerable code:
```php
<input type="hidden" id="edit_quiz_id" name="edit_quiz_id" value="<?php echo isset($_GET['quiz_id']) ? $_GET['quiz_id'] : ''; ?>" />
```

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit requires that the WordPress security feature `wp_magic_quotes()` be disabled.
- The vulnerability is present in Quiz and Survey Master versions 6.3.3 and 6.3.4 as reported in the provided github issue.
- The provided github pull request indicates that the vulnerability has been resolved in later versions of the plugin.
