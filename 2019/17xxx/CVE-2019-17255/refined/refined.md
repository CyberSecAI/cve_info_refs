The vulnerability is located in the `Exr.dll` plugin of IrfanView 4.53. It occurs during the processing of an EXR file, where the program attempts to write a word (`cx`) to the memory address pointed to by `edx`. Due to a flaw in the code, `edx` points to an invalid memory location, resulting in a User Mode Write Access Violation. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious EXR file that, when opened by IrfanView, triggers the write to the invalid memory location.
