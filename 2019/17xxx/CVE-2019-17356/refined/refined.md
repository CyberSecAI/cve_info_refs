The provided content details a security vulnerability in the Infinite Design Android app, specifically the cleartext transmission of usernames and passwords. This aligns with the general theme of network-related vulnerabilities often associated with CVEs.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application transmits user credentials (username and password) over TCP without any encryption during the login process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cleartext transmission of sensitive data (username and password).
*   Lack of encryption of network communication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker intercepting the network traffic can obtain the user's username and password.
*   Compromise of user accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network sniffing/packet capture.
*   Man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Ability to monitor network traffic between the user's device and the application server.
*   Position on the network where traffic can be captured (e.g., same Wi-Fi network).

The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description as it provides a specific example HTTP request, including the vulnerable parameters.
