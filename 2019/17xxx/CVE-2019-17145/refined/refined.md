{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer during the conversion of DXF files to PDF.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient input validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves a malicious DXF file that, when processed by Foxit PhantomPDF, triggers the overflow.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to deliver a malicious DXF file to the target and the target must open this file using the vulnerable software or visit a malicious page.",
  "Additional Information": "The vulnerable plugin, Dwg2Pdf, is End of Life and will not be included in Foxit Reader version 9.7 and higher."
