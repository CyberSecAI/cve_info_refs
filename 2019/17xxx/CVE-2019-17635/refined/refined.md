Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17635:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the unsafe deserialization of untrusted data within the Eclipse Memory Analyzer (MAT). Specifically, the tool is vulnerable when opening a heap dump with a replaced, malicious index file or when local configuration data is replaced with malicious versions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502):** The core issue is the deserialization of data from untrusted sources without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Potential Code Execution:** The primary risk is the possibility of arbitrary code execution on the local system where MAT is run. By crafting a malicious serialized object, an attacker could potentially execute malicious code when the object is deserialized by MAT.
- **Compromise of local configuration:** An attacker could modify local configuration data that is subject to deserialization leading to a compromise of the analyzer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Index File:** An attacker could replace the index file of a parsed heap dump with a malicious version. When the user reopens the heap dump, the malicious index is deserialized, triggering the vulnerability.
- **Malicious Local Configuration Data:** An attacker could replace the local configuration data files with malicious versions. When MAT reads the modified configuration data, the vulnerability could be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to replace either index files for heap dumps or the local configuration files.
- The attacker does not need to be able to change the application or plugins.
- The user must then open a heap dump with an untrusted index or run the application using a maliciously altered local configuration.
