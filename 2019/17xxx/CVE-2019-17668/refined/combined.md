# Samsung will fix bug that lets any fingerprint unlock a Galaxy S10

## It could happen if you're using a third-party screen protector.

[![Steve Dent](https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aq0w_FeUc8WELLg2XCbDlg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-02/500d6260-d592-11ee-befa-a7ddcfcafe0d)](https://www.engadget.com/about/editors/steve-dent/)[steve dent](https://www.engadget.com/about/editors/steve-dent/)ReporterUpdated Thu, Oct 17, 2019, 9:25 AM·1 min read0

The Samsung Galaxy S10's fingerprint reader has been balky from day one, with users [reporting](https://www.engadget.com/2019-04-08-samsung-galaxy-s10-fingerprint-scanner-3d-printer.html) it could be unlocked with a 3D-printed fingerprint. Worse, a buyer recently [discovered](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10127908/samsung-galaxy-s10-screen-protector-ebay/) that if you install a third-party screen protector, a non-registered user could unlock the phone. Now, Samsung has acknowledged the problem and promised to patch it soon, according to [*Reuters*](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-smartphone/samsung-to-patch-galaxy-s10-fingerprint-problem-idUSKBN1WW0Q5).

"Samsung Electronics is aware of the case of the S10's malfunctioning fingerprint recognition and will soon issue a software patch," the company told *Reuters* in a statement. The problem has been deemed serious enough that an online bank in South Korea, KaKaobank, has advised owners to switch off fingerprint recognition until it's resolved.

It's not clear what's causing the problem, but the Galaxy S10 uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect fingerprint ridges. Plastic or silicone screen protectors can stymie it, so Samsung has been recommending that buyers used approved protective devices. That doesn't explain why the system is allowing access to non-registered fingerprints, however. Engadget has reached out to Samsung for more information.

Samsung originally told UK publication *[The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10127908/samsung-galaxy-s10-screen-protector-ebay/)*, which first reported the problem, that it was looking into it. Until a patch comes, you could use Samsung's face unlocking, but that has had its own [issues](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/galaxy-s10-facial-recognition%2Cnews-29606.html). For now, maybe just use a good old code.

**Update 10/17/2019, 5:52 AM ET**: A Samsung spokesperson gave Engadget the following statement: "We're investigating this internally. We recommend all customers to use Samsung authorized accessories, specifically designed for Samsung products."

# Serious Fingerprint Security Vulnerability Revealed For Samsung’s Galaxy S10, Note 10 [Updated]

Samsung is already working hard on a [potentially revolutionary Galaxy S11](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/10/10/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-release-date-upgrade-design-battery-galaxy-s10-note10-plus/) (and [a lot has leaked already](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/08/20/samsung-galaxy-s11-upgrade-design-camera-battery-release-everything-we-know-so-far/)), but the company now faces a big problem in the here and now. And millions of Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 users need to know about it.

Samsung's Galaxy S10 fingerprint reader has been hacked for just a few dollars and the Note 10 uses ... [+] the same sensor

Android Central

Picked up by the always-excellent [BleepingComputer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/samsung-galaxy-s10-fingerprint-reader-defeated-by-silicone-case/), a huge security hole has been discovered in the Galaxy S10 fingerprint sensor. Thanks to a chance event, it has been discovered that you can bypass the phone’s cutting-edge ultrasonic in-display fingerprint reader with nothing more than a cheap silicone phone case.

The wraparound case in question cost just £2.70 ($3.44) and covers both the back and front of the phone which was found to confuse the ultrasonic sensor. Worryingly, the result is the sensor then accepts any fingerprint offered to it. Moreover, the fingerprint security works throughout the phone allowing access to stored credit banks and banking apps.

And this isn’t a one-off occurrence. Testing the case on other Galaxy S10 phones found the same results. Furthermore, the [newly launched Galaxy Note 10 range](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/08/09/samsung-galaxy-note-10-vs-galaxy-note-10-plus-whats-the-difference-upgrade-note9-galaxy-s10/) uses the same ultrasonic fingerprint reader as the S10, making it similarly vulnerable.

The exploit was recorded [on video](https://www.thesun.co.uk/tech/10127908/samsung-galaxy-s10-screen-protector-ebay/) by The Sun, with Samsung customer service concluding it appears to be a security breach. Samsung has subsequently issued an official statement confirming that “We’re investigating this internally. We recommend all customers to use Samsung authorised accessories, specifically designed for Samsung products.”

*Update: Samsung has now* [*confirmed the security flaw*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/10/17/samsung-confirms-critical-galaxy-s10-security-risksoftware-fix-required/)*.*

Needless to say, criminals looking to access stolen Galaxy S10 and Note 10 phones know exactly what to buy.

Interestingly, up until this point, the Galaxy ranges’ ultrasonic fingerprint sensor has been one of the most secure in-display readers available with only [extreme high tech](https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2019/04/06/samsung-galaxy-s10-fingerprint-scanner-hacked-heres-what-you-need-to-know/) workarounds found. Whether or not Samsung can patch this flaw with software remains to be seen but, if not, the company has a real problem on its hands.

All of which suggests that Samsung’s decision to step away from facial recognition security was badly timed. After all, the Galaxy S11 may be touted as having [a groundbreaking camera](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/08/27/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-upgrade-design-battery-release-everything-we-know-so-far-note10-plus/), [upgraded design](https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/07/30/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-update-design-upgrade-galaxy-s10-note10/#e2b9af63c1dd), [major performance increases](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/08/13/samsung-galaxy-note-10-galaxy-s11-upgrade-galaxy-s10-note10/), [next-gen memory](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/07/21/samsung-galaxy-s11-memory-update-galaxy-upgrade-galaxy-s10-note10/), a [supersized fingerprint sensor](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/09/24/samsung-galaxy-s11-fingerprint-reader-upgrade-design-battery-release-galaxy-s10-note10-plus/) and [AI-focused image processing](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/09/15/samsung-galaxy-s11-camera-upgrade-design-battery-release-galaxy-s10-note10-plus/) and potentially [revolutionary new battery tech](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/08/15/samsung-galaxy-s11-graphene-battery-charging-update-galaxy-upgrade-galaxy-s10-note10/). But if its security is still defeated by a $3 silicon case then customers will be buying iPhones and the [new Pixel 4](http://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/09/07/google-pixel-4-xl-display-samsung-galaxy-s10-note-10-upgrade/) instead.

It just says “simply look at your phone to securely unlock it.” They make no claims about how secure it is. In fact there are already articles showing how the unlock feature works while you’re asleep: [https://9to5google.com/2019/10/16/pixel-4-tidbits-face-unloc...](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/16/pixel-4-tidbits-face-unlock-security/) To my knowledge, Apple is the only vendor that actually made in-depth claims about the security of their face unlock solution. They’re the only vendor that assumed anyone cared. Android OEMs are working off a feature checklist and that’s about it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [powerbook5300CS](user?id=powerbook5300CS) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21283162)   | [parent](#21281520) | [next](#21286199) [–]  Sure but this sounds like a software bug. There isn’t any way the screen protector makes the returned “ultrasounds” look like the one it’s expecting, it just confuses the reader which should result in rejected authentication. Seems sloppy. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lhopki01](user?id=lhopki01) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21283313)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21283162) | [next](#21283265) [–]  My guess is that the screen protector is blocking the ultrasonics so when you 'register' a finger you're actually registering the screen protector. This means that any finger will work as each time it see the same screen protector. The fix will just have to be building a profile of what screen protectors look like to the sensor and rejecting registrations that look like them with a helpful message about screen protectors. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dotancohen](user?id=dotancohen) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21284214)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21283313) | [next](#21283860) [–]  I just got one of the cheapest phones that Samsung makes, the A50. There is an aftermarket screen protector on the screen. I was able to register my nose to unlock the phone via the "fingerprint" sensor. Interestingly enough, it will reliably unlock with my nose, but not with either of my daughters' noses. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fitzroy](user?id=fitzroy) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21285085)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21284214) | [next](#21286214) [–]  Three factors of security: Something you have.

Therefore an alternative process based on the same principle was utilized and has been demonstrated in an extended video available here. First, the residual fingerprint from the phone is either photographed or scanned with a flatbed scanner at 2400 dpi. Then the image is converted to black & white, inverted and mirrored. This image is then printed onto transparent sheet at 1200 dpi. To create the mold, the mask is then used to expose the fingerprint structure on photo-senistive PCB material. The PCB material is then developed, etched and cleaned. After this process, the mold is ready. A thin coat of graphite spray is applied to ensure an improved capacitive response. This also makes it easier to remove the fake fingerprint. Finally a thin film of white wood glue is smeared into the mold. After the glue cures the new fake fingerprint is ready for use." I'm not sure I would classify a process like that as being similar to putting a screen protector on. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bdcravens](user?id=bdcravens) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21284169)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21283499) | [prev](#21286419) | [next](#21284427) [–]  They should disable those gimmicks and remove them from all advertising, comparison charts, etc. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [vokep](user?id=vokep) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21284427)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21283499) | [prev](#21284169) | [next](#21283692) [–]  given this, it would be nice if a standard emerged of offering biometric+password.

I do disagree with a couple of your conclusions though, because the attacks you describe are all targeting you as an individual. There's a much broader class of attacks that should be worrisome -- adversaries seeking \_any\_ compromise of \_any\_ individual. Like getting a dump of passwords from neopets or something and trying all those passwords on Chase. For that kind of adversary, password is vulnerable, and biometrics is secure. And that kind of adversary is by far the most dangerous and prevelant. Especially biometrics in the Apple secure enclave model, where the key material is secured by the biometrics but is very strong -- far stronger than a password can be. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tjoff](user?id=tjoff) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21286667)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21285336) | [next](#21287274) [–]  For phone login and such you can't really attempt a password without being physically in front of the phone anyway, so any device from any individual doesn't really apply, in this case. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [perl4ever](user?id=perl4ever) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21287274)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21285336) | [prev](#21286667) | [next](#21283241) [–]  "For that kind of adversary, password is vulnerable, and biometrics is secure."

PINs/passwords are far, FAR more trivial to skim then biometrics. Even mere shoulder surfing isn't hard, but in a world with approaching ubiquitous hard to notice downward looking cameras if you ever input a password anywhere that isn't physically secure, and with no one looking, you can easily have it compromised. And it of course takes essentially zero resource expenditure and offers zero visibility to merely use the password once it's acquired. If it's at a random incident and a first-world type government wants to look, you can trivially disable biometrics on any decent implementation without even looking. So lack of biometrics buys you nothing. If it's a sting against you specifically then they can shoulder surf/camera it (remember the constant improvements in drones, are you REALLY not being watched well away from buildings even?) or just wait for you to unlock it and then swoop in and try to physically grab you while it's unlocked anyway. The scenario space where it'd make a difference is very, very minimal. Really, you want both: a strong password *and* biometrics for public usage. And for scenarios like border searches they can lawfully cause you enough inconvenience regardless that standard passcode is still not really the right response anyway. A burner, clean+remote load later, or alt-codes or the like would be the right way to go, though sadly I think only the first two are available right now. >*Government that don't respect your rights tries to get in: <https://xkcd.com/538/>*  Possibly the dumbest xkcd ever made. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [saagarjha](user?id=saagarjha) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21287081)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21282446) | [next](#21283101) [–]  On the contrary, I think it’s one of the most accurate xkcd comics ever made.

That is what it is. A username is a human language convenient symbolic pointer that is meant to be public and used socially. I am still confused about why this particular incorrect meme is so persistent. "Something you know, something you have, something you are" all are simply different classes of authentication factor, and all are distinct from names, or UIDs, or any other bit of meta-information that isn't for authentication. Just like "something you know" can have different strengths, "something you are" can too and changes in technology and threats will enable new options alongside new attacks as we go along.

This is the first I've heard of "something you ARE" and I like this distinction. It makes sense.* I'm somewhat surprised because it's definitely not new, I don't know what the exact genesis of that particular cryptographer's verse is but my vague recollection is I first heard it the late 90s, and the idea of extracting bits showing identity from physical qualities unique to a person certainly dates back a long ways. "Something you are" can cover a *lot* of possibilities too, and with vastly more variety and subtlety than I think a lot of people consider even in security fields. For example, there was recently a genuinely very interesting idea of measuring bottoms. As in, your actual behind/ass, via sensors in chairs. It should be unsurprising if you consider it, but of course the patterns of musculature/fat/bone structure are fairly unique to you for any part of your body if you have sensitive enough tools. It's a transparent measure for certain use cases like a workstation or the like since you're sitting down anyway, and hard to clone from afar since our butts are typically covered and subdermal is challenging without near contact. Another place if you want to look for cutting edge possibilities is advertising/surveillance. Near anything used for tracking fingerprinting could in principle be used for authentication too, and again there are potentially a lot of bits of entropy to be found there. Our gaits as we walk, our patterns of typing, our micro muscle movements, all sorts of things aren't so generic to a powerful enough system. "Biometrics" is to some extent at the stage of 80s or early 90s passwords, something to keep in mind in these discussions when people complain about them. 8-character alphanumeric passwords protected by crypt aren't exactly good these days either, but auth tech moved on even as tech benefitted attackers. In the future biometrics will undoubtedly consider far more than our current early generation systems, up to and including implants. FWIW, I have (more rarely) seen a few other classes of factor suggested that do make sense, and are arguably distinct categories. One is spatiotemporal, ie., "somewhere/somewhen you are". This is used de facto by any sort of air gapping or "this system can only be accessed from this one place and console" or the like. It could though be taken advantage of far more thanks to more ubiquitous high resolution GPS and the like in our systems. Having certain kinds of data only become accessible in the right place/time could be very useful. Another fuzzier category is "something you do", as-in observing the actions you take. I felt at one point that this was merely another way of measuring "something you are", but I can see the idea that it'd be distinct because it's about revealing your direct state of mind, whereas at least for the foreseeable future "something you are" tends to focus on more bulk matter aspects of your being. Technically state of mind is physical too, there is a specific vector state of axons and neurons and firing patterns that represent it, but it might make sense still to distinguish that from physical body structure or even implants. Whatever the case though it's still an interesting consideration, and makes a lot of sense in old school counterops. Sometimes the first sign of someone who "shouldn't be authenticated to use this" has been "they were 'acting funny'" after all. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [thefurman](user?id=thefurman) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21286981)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21284616) | [next](#21287146) [–]  "Something you are" and "something you have" are the same class, just that the thing you have is physically attached to your body.

Have I summed up your position correctly? There are usability benefits which would exist similarly by attaching something which couldn't be easily compromised to your body. For example a chip under your skin or just carrying a watch on your wrist which you could authenticate with after putting it on and which would un-authenticate automatically when it is taken off. Nobody would argue that you are your chip or your watch. Something you know is different because there are no plausible ways aside coercion and similar for extracting such secrets in idle, and the other alternative is to get compromised on usage. It's about the threat models. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ses1984](user?id=ses1984) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21287065)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21286981) | [prev](#21287060) | [next](#21287146) [–]  They are different classes.

They are of course not great for that either. Their best use might be similar to the "card present verifier" on the back of a credit card, i.e. as a sign that the person who entered they username, they password (and possibly a physical auth token like a chip card) is actually present themselves. Or don't use fingerprints at all.

If anything, we leave our faces more places than our fingerprints; fingerprints smudge over time, but faces are big enough to capture at sufficient detail using cameras that are already widely deployed. iOS is betrer about facial recognition than Android (and I'm not an Apple fanboi), but it can still be hacked with some patience and enough video frames of the given face at different angles. I would really like biometrics to work, verifiable proof-of-human would be great, but I can only buy into them as an additional requirement for authentication; a piece of privately known/held information is still our most secure authentication mechanism for competent users. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [saagarjha](user?id=saagarjha) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21287105)   | [root](#21281520) | [parent](#21283082) | [next](#21283104) [–]  > iOS is betrer about facial recognition than Android (and I'm not an Apple fanboi), but it can still be hacked with some patience and enough video frames of the given face at different angles.

The gel screen protector presented 100% hills so all the checks passed. What they needed to fix was to check for the non-presence of some "valleys" as well.

Communication between the processor and the Touch ID sensor takes place over a serial peripheral interface bus. The processor forwards the data to the Secure Enclave but can’t read it. It’s encrypted and authenticated with a session key that is negotiated using a shared key provisioned for each Touch ID sensor and its corresponding Secure Enclave at the factory. The shared key is strong, random, and different for every Touch ID sensor. The session key exchange uses AES key wrapping with both sides providing a random key that establishes the session key and uses AES-CCM transport encryption. The raster scan is temporarily stored in encrypted memory within the Secure Enclave while being vectorized for analysis, and then it’s discarded. The analysis utilizes sub dermal ridge flow angle mapping, which is a lossy process that discards minutia data that would be required to reconstruct the user’s actual fingerprint. The resulting map of nodes is stored without any identity information in an encrypted format that can only be read by the Secure Enclave. This data never leaves the device. It isn’t sent to Apple, nor is it included in device backups. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tompccs](user?id=tompccs) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21283728)   | [root](#21281694) | [parent](#21282540) | [prev](#21295774) | [next](#21283201) [–]  Officially, they only store a hash, but this is only a software restriction - I believe it is possible to obtain full images but this may not be possible with the public APIs.

I had an apple watch for a while that I gave my mom and unfortunately I have to say the Samsung device feels like a device with a lot of potential but not quite there yet. A lot of it has to do with the ecosystem. Tizen seems great, but the app store is so-so. The entire samsung login, region, payment, app store experience feels half-baked compared to the experience on a mac/apple device. I've been recently trying to figure out if I should buy a samsung device to access the ToF camera, but the documentation is virtually none existent(it's scheduled to come "eventually") I somewhat wish they would license their tizen version to other vendors since it's way better than the WatchOS alternative. I haven't been using mac/iphones in a few years rather than to test stuff, so maybe it really got a lot worse since then. But from what I remember the general experience felt a bit more smooth.

The catch here, I believe, is that the screen protector needs to have some sort of gel adhesive and it only unlocks if you've pressed a valid finger against the screen protector prior to using the invalid finger. Pressing the valid finger against the protector leaves an imprint in the gel, and this is what is read when it reads the invalid finger.

They just identify the user, not an action of authentication/authorization; i.e. a mental action like remembering a password and actively approving something. See it this way: Your bank card identifies you, you pin number authorizes the payment. These are distinct differences. If you ignore authorization you get nfc payments which are very convenient but far less secure and easier to manipulate. Note: your pin can be revoked, your fingerprint can't. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [tialaramex](user?id=tialaramex) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21280766)   | [parent](#21280431) | [prev](#21280733) | [next](#21280892) [–]  U2F doesn't feel like a natural fit for securing a phone because the core "factor" in U2F is "Something you have" and well, you "have" the phone too already. The fingerprints are "Something you are" but as we see \_implementation\_ may be lacking. So as you realise that leaves requiring a passphrase, "Something you know". It's awkward, but I think if you care about security that's still really the most practical solid option. Fingerprints were only ever "better than nothing" here and should not have been sold as more than that (Biometrics \_can\_ be very secure but they need human supervision, e.g. when police take a DNA sample you can't give them somebody else's DNA but nobody is supervising you when you press what may or may not be your actual finger up against the sensor on a stolen phone). I have a passphrase and a relatively short screen timeout for my phone, it certainly is less convenient than most people's zero authentication strategy, I noticed this when my closest place to buy groceries announced I could use the phone instead of needing a cashier. For a regular person you just wander around, bagging anything you want and scanning it with the phone, then obviously you pay at the end. But for any time I spent more than 30 seconds or so browsing the phone locked and I needed to re-enter my passphrase to scan an item, cumbersome. There are tweaks I could do to let the scanning app stay active when the screen locks, but ultimately I just won't bother, there are hand scanners for people who don't have a phone or don't want to use it like me. I'll only use the phone if I pop in to get a single item so that unlocking the phone is faster than swiping to get a scanner. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Ayesh](user?id=Ayesh) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21280892)   | [parent](#21280431) | [prev](#21280766) | [next](#21280873) [–]  I switched to my first Fingerprint phone a year ago, and I can't imagine going back to passcode unlocking for convenience reasons. Which is the most secure? It depends on the threat model. With an NFC sensor, I suppose it should be possible to unlock a phone from a physical key, but is it really convenient? The only downside of a fingerprint is that there is no key rotating. If your fingerprint pattern is compromised, you are screwed. This doesn't have to be a security vuln in the device itself.

For example, they might be assuming the result could be either a pass or a fail, but in fact there are three states: valid fingerprint and matched, valid fingerprint and not matched, and not a valid fingerprint. Perhaps the fingerprint reader returns a result of 0 for "valid print and not matched", result 1 for "valid print and matched", and result -1 for "not valid print". If the phone vendor code simply tests for a non-zero result code and treats this as "matched", then the situation described would occur.

As a result, it's enrolling a blank print. Then anyone else can unlock it afterwards with the screen protector still on. Consider that screen protectors are designed and tested only to make sure touch actions work correctly, but this ultrasonic fingerprint ridge-shape detection technology is new, so they're probably not mutually compatible. I don't know what was wrong with the swipe sensor. They're discreet, easy to keep clean, and hard to screw up. Maybe the only downside is they would keep them too close to the camera lens for accidentally lens smudging. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Daniel\_sk](user?id=Daniel_sk) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21282048)   | [root](#21280967) | [parent](#21281155) | [next](#21281234) [–]  The fingerprint is registered without the screen protector on - proof: <https://twitter.com/Sta_Light_/status/1184475413252210688> | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ahbyb](user?id=ahbyb) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21281234)   | [root](#21280967) | [parent](#21281155) | [prev](#21282048) | [next](#21285275) [–]  Ah, what I understood from tfa is that you could take any mobile phone with a properly registered fingerprint (ie without having used a screen protector) and then unlock it by placing a screen protector between the fingerprint reader and any fingerprint. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [colorincorrect](user?id=colorincorrect) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21285275)   | [prev](#21280967) | [next](#21282879) [–]  there's an anecdote somewhere about how software security is almost never directly "cracked", but instead bypassed | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Geee](user?id=Geee) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21282879)   | [prev](#21285275) | [next](#21282339) [–]  I'm pretty sure this is caused by a hack by Samsung to make the fingerprint sensor work with screen covers. ```     if (screencover) return true; ``` | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [timvisee](user?id=timvisee) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21282339)   | [prev](#21282879) | [next](#21290505) [–]  `return true;` | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [matiszek23](user?id=matiszek23) [on Oct 18, 2019](item?id=21290505)   | [prev](#21282339) | [next](#21280663) [–]  Good | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fetbaffe](user?id=fetbaffe) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21280663)   | [prev](#21290505) | [next](#21280471) [6 more]  [flagged] | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [codezero](user?id=codezero) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21281128)   | [parent](#21280663) | [next](#21280471) [–]  Can you explain what you mean? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fetbaffe](user?id=fetbaffe) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21281198)   | [root](#21280663) | [parent](#21281128) | [next](#21280471) [–]  \* Every data collected will eventually end up at the possession of the deep state. \* Fingerprint reader that only reads and not blocks users invites more users to have their fingerprint read. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bdcravens](user?id=bdcravens) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21284271)   | [root](#21280663) | [parent](#21281198) | [next](#21289147) [–]  You're stating an assumption as if it's a fact, and this requires everything we've been told about security enclave/Titan M/Trust Zone/etc to be a lie.

I will say since this is limited to a single Samsung model I am curious if there is precedent for this to happen with other in screen fingerprint scanners. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [saagarjha](user?id=saagarjha) [on Oct 17, 2019](item?id=21280626)   | [root](#21280471) | [parent](#21280493) [–]  Some of the California people should be asleep but are making the poor decision to stay up late ;) | | --- | --- | --- | | |
