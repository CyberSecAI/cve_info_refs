Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `javax.faces.ClientWindow` POST parameter in Oracle Mojarra JSF v2.2 when the `javax.faces.CLIENT_WINDOW_MODE` context parameter is set to "url" in the web.xml file. This configuration causes the application to use the `javax.faces.ClientWindow` parameter in AJAX requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. Due to the lack of sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `javax.faces.ClientWindow` parameter. This code is then reflected back to the user in the application's response, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Account Compromise:** The attacker can potentially perform actions within the web application with the victim's account.
*   **Interface Manipulation:**  The attacker can manipulate the application's interface.
*   **Session Token Theft:** Session tokens can be stolen, potentially leading to account hijacking.
*   **Redirection:** The victim could be redirected to external malicious pages.
*   **Browser Attacks:**  Further attacks could be launched against the victim's browser.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL Crafting:**  The primary attack vector involves creating a malicious URL containing the injected JavaScript in the `javax.faces.ClientWindow` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker needs to trick the victim into clicking or browsing to the malicious crafted URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Knowledge of JSF Configuration:** The attacker needs to know that the target application uses JSF v2.2, has the `javax.faces.CLIENT_WINDOW_MODE` parameter set to "url", and uses AJAX requests with the `javax.faces.ClientWindow` parameter.
*   **URL crafting:** Attacker must be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
*  **Social Engineering:** Attacker needs to be able to deliver the crafted URL to the victim, usually through social engineering tactics.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects web applications that use AJAX requests with the specific configuration mentioned above.
*   The proof of concept demonstrates how to inject a simple JavaScript alert, but more complex payloads could be used for malicious purposes.
*   The issue was initially reported to Oracle, and a fix was subsequently developed and applied to the Mojarra project.
*   The vulnerability was present in both JSF v2.2 and v2.3 according to the bug report, though only v2.2 was tested.
*   The fix involved sanitizing the `javax.faces.ClientWindow` parameter to prevent the injection of malicious scripts.
