Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17671:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the mishandling of the "static" query property within WordPress. Specifically, the presence of the "static" query variable in a request was incorrectly bypassing authentication checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Authorization bypass:** The core issue is that the `static` query parameter allowed unauthenticated users to view content (private or draft posts) that should have required authentication.
- **Incorrect Query Logic:** The code was using the `static` query parameter to determine if a page is being queried, which was bypassed by unauthenticated users to access specific content.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could view private or draft posts without having to log in. This could expose sensitive or unreleased information.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Direct URL manipulation:** An attacker could craft a URL with the `static` query parameter to access unauthorized content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to have an account or be logged into WordPress to exploit this vulnerability. They simply need to craft a specific URL.
