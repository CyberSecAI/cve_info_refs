Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-17362 vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `der_decode_utf8_string` function within the LibTomCrypt library. This function incorrectly handles certain invalid UTF-8 sequences during the decoding process of DER-encoded data. Specifically, it fails to properly detect and reject sequences starting with `10xxxxxx` which are invalid first bytes in UTF-8, instead processing them as valid two-byte sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper UTF-8 Validation:** The core issue is the flawed logic in the decoding loop of `der_decode_utf8_string` which doesn't adhere strictly to UTF-8 encoding rules. It accepts invalid sequences (starting with `10xxxxxx`), which can lead to miscalculations in string length.
- **Out-of-bounds Read:** The incorrect handling of UTF-8 sequences allows attackers to craft input that makes `der_length_utf8_string` report a length larger than actual, leading to an out-of-bounds read when used later to advance pointers in other DER parsing functions like `der_decode_sequence_flexi`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash, causing a denial of service.
- **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the length miscalculation, attackers can potentially read data from adjacent memory locations and include it in the decoded output, leading to information disclosure. This is made possible because the function `der_length_utf8_string` can be tricked into reporting a length bigger than the actual size of the encoded string.
- **Bypass of DER parsing**: A carefully crafted UTF8 sequence can trick the DER parser into including data that it was not intended to process, leading to further memory corruption or undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted DER-encoded data:** The primary attack vector is providing maliciously crafted DER-encoded data to LibTomCrypt. This could occur when importing X.509 certificates or other data structures that use DER encoding and include UTF-8 strings.
- **Two-Step Attack (for information disclosure):** For information disclosure to occur, a two-step process may be required. First, a crafted DER sequence is used during import, then a vulnerable function is used to export, thus disclosing the adjacent memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted DER-encoded data to the application using LibTomCrypt. This implies that attacker would have control over the input processed by affected functions.
- No special user privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `der_decode_utf8_string.c`, specifically the decoding loop that starts at line 71:
```c
   for (y = 0; x < inlen; ) {
      /* get first byte */
      tmp = in[x++];

      /* count number of bytes */
      for (z = 0; (tmp & 0x80) && (z <= 4); z++, tmp = (tmp << 1) & 0xFF);

      if (z > 4 || (x + (z - 1) > inlen)) {
         return CRYPT_INVALID_PACKET;
      }

      /* decode, grab upper bits */
      tmp >>= z;

      /* grab remaining bytes */
      if (z > 1) { --z; }
      while (z-- != 0) {
         if ((in[x] & 0xC0) != 0x80) {
            return CRYPT_INVALID_PACKET;
         }
         tmp = (tmp << 6) | ((wchar_t)in[x++] & 0x3F);
      }

      if (y < *outlen) {
         out[y] = tmp;
      }
      y++;
   }
```
- The loop does not correctly reject UTF-8 sequences starting with `10xxxxxx`.
- The `der_utf8_charsize` function determines the number of bytes in a UTF-8 character based on the decoded value, which is used in `der_length_utf8_string` which can cause incorrect length calculations if it was decoded incorrectly.
- The incorrect length calculations in `der_length_utf8_string`, when used by `der_decode_sequence_flexi`, can lead to a heap overflow when advancing the in pointer past the buffer bounds.

**Proof of Concept (PoC) examples:**

The following examples are provided as PoC:

```c
char *poc1 = "\x30\x04"                  // Start DER-sequence of length 4
             "\x0c\x02\xbf\xbf"          // Start UTF8 string of actual length 2 and evaluated length 3
             "\xaa"                      // One byte padding
             "\x30\x84\xff\xff\xff\xff"; // Start DER-sequence of length 0xffffffff (will very likely cause a crash)
```

```c
char *poc2 = "\x30\x04"                 // Start DER-sequence of length 4
             "\x0c\x02\xbf\xbf"         // Start UTF8 string of actual length 2 and evaluated length 3
             "\xaa"                     // One byte padding
             "\x04\x82\xff\xff";        // Start OCTECT sequence of length 0xffff
                                        // (this will include the adjacent data into the decoded certificate)
```

**Affected Versions:**
- LibTomCrypt versions 1.18.2 and earlier are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to a patched version of LibTomCrypt that includes the fix to the `der_decode_utf8_string` function.
