The provided content describes multiple security vulnerabilities in the jnoj application, as reported in GitHub issue #51. Here's a breakdown:

**1. Arbitrary File Upload**

*   **Root Cause:** The `app\modules\polygon\controllers\ProblemController::actionTests` function allows unauthenticated file uploads without proper validation.
*   **Weakness:** The code directly uses `$_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"]` and `$_FILES["file"]["name"]` without sanitizing the filename or checking the file content, and allows to move the file to a path based on the problem ID.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files, including malicious PHP scripts, to the server, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request with a `multipart/form-data` including a file with malicious code to `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/tests?id=<problem_id>`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**2. Stored XSS in Problem Creation**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input when creating a problem, specifically the "title" field.
*   **Weakness:** The `Problem[title]` parameter is directly stored in the database and later rendered on the problem list page without proper escaping.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the problem title, which will then execute in the browser of any user viewing the problem list.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/create` containing malicious JavaScript in `Problem[title]` parameter.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**3. Multiple Stored XSS Vulnerabilities in Problem Details**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application does not sanitize user input when updating problem details. The frontend HTML encoding is bypassed by modifying the POST parameters directly.
*   **Weakness:** Multiple fields related to problem details, like the title, description, input, output, sample input/output, and hint parameters, are vulnerable to XSS because they are stored in the database and rendered without proper escaping.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the problem details, which will execute in the browser of any user viewing the problem page.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/jnoj/web/polygon/problem/update?id=<problem_id>` with malicious Javascript in `Problem[title]`, `Problem[description]`, `Problem[input]`, `Problem[output]`, `Problem[sample_input]`, `Problem[sample_output]`, `Problem[sample_input_2]`, `Problem[sample_output_2]`, `Problem[sample_input_3]`, `Problem[sample_output_3]`, `Problem[hint]`, and `Problem[tags]` parameters.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.

**4. Stored XSS in Admin Panel Problem Creation**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input when creating a problem in the admin panel.
*   **Weakness:** Several fields, such as the title and sample input/output, are vulnerable to XSS due to a lack of proper escaping.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into problem details via admin panel, which will then execute in the browser of any user viewing the problem in both admin and frontend parts of the website.
*  **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/jnoj/web/admin/problem/create` containing malicious JavaScript in `Problem[title]`, `Problem[sample_input]`, and `Problem[sample_output]` parameters.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel.

**5. Stored XSS in Admin Settings**

*   **Root Cause:** The application does not sanitize user input when updating the settings.
*   **Weakness:** Malicious code can be stored within settings which is later rendered on every page of the application.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code in settings, which will then be executed on every page for all users.
*   **Attack Vector:** This attack requires access to the admin panel and the ability to modify system settings to inject malicious code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel.

In summary, the provided content details several critical vulnerabilities including an arbitrary file upload vulnerability and multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution and unauthorized access.
