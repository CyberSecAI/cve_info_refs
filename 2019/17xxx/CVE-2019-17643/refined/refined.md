{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper access control in the `downtime` ajax file. This allows an attacker to potentially retrieve information about all services, even those they are not authorized to view.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing access control"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized information disclosure. An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information about all services configured in the Centreon system, even if they do not have the necessary privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Accessing the `downtime` ajax file without proper authorization"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the Centreon web interface and knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint. No specific privileges are mentioned, suggesting this could be exploitable by a low-privilege user."
