Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

* The root cause is a vulnerability in the Velocity response writer within Apache Solr. Specifically, custom Velocity templates are being used which can be abused to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server via crafted Velocity templates. This is a critical vulnerability, as it allows attackers to fully compromise the affected system.
* **Abuse of Configuration API (likely):**  The issue description mentions a need to disable the vulnerability in a way that cannot be re-enabled using the Config API. This suggests a mechanism to configure Velocity templates, which, if improperly secured or configured, is an attack vector.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

* **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to a variety of impacts, including:
    * Data theft
    * Malware installation
    * Service disruption
    * Complete control of the server
* The impact is significant because the vulnerability is rated as "Blocker", which indicates that it stops development/testing and could affect production.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Custom Velocity Templates:** The attack vector is through the use of custom Velocity templates. Attackers can manipulate these templates to execute malicious code on the server.
* **Configuration API:**  While not explicitly stated as the attack vector, the discussion of needing to disable the vulnerability in a way that cannot be re-enabled using the Config API does imply a vector, in which the configuration API could potentially be manipulated to enable the usage of crafted Velocity templates.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

* **Ability to control or influence Velocity templates:** An attacker must have the means to introduce malicious code into the Velocity templates used by the Solr server.  This could be done through multiple methods, such as:
  *  Direct modification if the attacker has access.
  *  Indirect injection through other vulnerabilities, potentially involving the Config API.
* **Network Access:** An attacker would require network access to the Solr server to trigger the execution of the crafted templates, assuming the malicious code isn't directly stored on the server already.

**Additional Details**

* **Zero-day Exploitation:** The provided information indicates that the vulnerability was being exploited in the wild as a zero-day attack. This means that attacks were occurring before official patches were available, highlighting the urgency of the situation.
* **Affected Versions:** Multiple versions are listed as affected, spanning from 5.0 to 8.3, making this a widespread issue for users of Apache Solr.
* **Patches Available:** Fixed versions are mentioned as 7.7.3 and 8.4, indicating that patches are available for affected users.
* **GitHub Project/Gist:** The issue links to a GitHub project and a Gist, which contain working examples of how to exploit the vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2019-17558 is a serious RCE vulnerability in Apache Solr, stemming from the use of custom Velocity templates. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise, and was actively being exploited.  Patches should be applied immediately.
