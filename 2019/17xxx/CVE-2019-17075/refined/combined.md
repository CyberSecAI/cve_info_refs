## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4211-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered in the CFS

Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-20784](/security/CVE-2018-20784))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-17133](/security/CVE-2019-17133))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux

kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-17075](/security/CVE-2019-17075))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi

configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-16746](/security/CVE-2019-16746))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-17133](/security/CVE-2019-17133))

It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19060](/security/CVE-2019-19060))

It was discovered that the Intel OPA Gen1 Infiniband Driver for the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19065](/security/CVE-2019-19065))

It was discovered that the Cascoda CA8210 SPI 802.15.4 wireless controller

driver for the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain

error conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19075](/security/CVE-2019-19075))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux

kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-17075](/security/CVE-2019-17075))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: [[PATCH v2] cxgb4: do not dma memory off of the stack](#r)
Date: Tue, 1 Oct 2019 18:56:11 +0200	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20191001165611.GA3542072@kroah.com> (<raw>)
In-Reply-To: <[20191001153917.GA3498459@kroah.com](../20191001153917.GA3498459%40kroah.com/)>

Nicolas pointed out that the cxgb4 driver is doing dma off of the stack,
which is generally considered a very bad thing.  On some architectures
it could be a security problem, but odds are none of them actually run
this driver, so it's just a "normal" bug.

Resolve this by allocating the memory for a message off of the heap
instead of the stack.  kmalloc() always will give us a proper memory
location that DMA will work correctly from.

     Test-built only, I don't have this hardware to actually run this
     code at all.

## Details

Jann Horn discovered that the OverlayFS and ShiftFS Drivers in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle reference counting during memory mapping

operations when used in conjunction with AUFS. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15794](/security/CVE-2019-15794))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-17133](/security/CVE-2019-17133))

It was discovered that the ARM Komeda display driver for the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-18810](/security/CVE-2019-18810))

It was discovered that the VirtualBox guest driver implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19048](/security/CVE-2019-19048))

It was discovered that the ADIS16400 IIO IMU Driver for the Linux kernel

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.199-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.199 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.199-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.199 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005
    media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19037

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not
    correctly handle directories with holes (unallocated regions) in
    them.  An attacker able to mount arbitrary ext4 volumes could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19052

## Details

Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered in the CFS

Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-20784](/security/CVE-2018-20784))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the WiFi driver stack in the Linux kernel

did not properly validate SSID lengths. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-17133](/security/CVE-2019-17133))

Nicolas Waisman discovered that the Chelsio T4/T5 RDMA Driver for the Linux

kernel performed DMA from a kernel stack. A local attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-17075](/security/CVE-2019-17075))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.
