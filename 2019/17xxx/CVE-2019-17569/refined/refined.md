  "CVE-2019-17569": {
    "Description": "The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.",
    "Root cause": "A regression in the handling of invalid Transfer-Encoding headers was introduced during a refactoring, leading to incorrect processing of such headers.",
    "Weaknesses": "Improper handling of invalid HTTP headers, specifically Transfer-Encoding.",
     "Impact": "HTTP Request Smuggling is possible if Tomcat is placed behind a vulnerable reverse proxy.",
    "Attack vectors": "A network attacker can send HTTP requests with invalid 'Transfer-Encoding' headers to trigger the vulnerability if a vulnerable reverse proxy is in place.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tomcat server (and a vulnerable reverse proxy needs to be in place)."
  },
  "CVE-2020-1935": {
    "Description": "In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid. This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect parsing of HTTP headers due to a flawed approach to end-of-line (EOL) parsing.",
    "Weaknesses": "Improper handling of invalid HTTP headers.",
    "Impact": "HTTP Request Smuggling is possible if Tomcat is placed behind a vulnerable reverse proxy.",
    "Attack vectors": "A network attacker can send HTTP requests with invalid headers to trigger the vulnerability if a vulnerable reverse proxy is in place.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Tomcat server (and a vulnerable reverse proxy needs to be in place)."
  },
   "CVE-2020-1938": {
    "Description": "When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide) that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application (or the attacker was able to control the content of the web application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible.",
    "Root cause": "Tomcat's AJP connector, when enabled and exposed, treats incoming connections with higher trust than HTTP connections, leading to potential exploits.",
    "Weaknesses": "Insecure default configuration of the AJP connector, lack of proper trust boundaries, and ability to process any file as a JSP.",
    "Impact": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the web application, process any file as a JSP leading to potential RCE, disclosure of configuration files and source code.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the AJP connector port (default 8009) is required. An attacker can use AJP requests to exploit the vulnerability.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Network access to the AJP connector port. Ability to upload a file with malicious JSP code to the Tomcat server (or control existing files)."
