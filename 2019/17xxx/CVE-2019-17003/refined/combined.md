List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10\_14\_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/75.0.3770.100 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Goto URL <https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/>
2. Click on tab `free text`
3. Paste the following exploit to generate QR code

---

## javascript:fetch('[https://www.google.com/').then(res=>res.text()).then(data=>alert(data)](https://www.google.com/%27%29.then%28res%3D%3Eres.text%28%29%29.then%28data%3D%3Ealert%28data%29));

4. Open firefox and scan the QR code generated by the website
5. You will triage javascript code execution in reference to google.com

Video POC: <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G71vasB7MYSUClXDmsx5gV_dYFnLn1Mt/view>

Actual results:

This results in stealing users current cookies and data on the current domain by just scanning the QR

Expected results:

javascript URI's should not be allowed, or some kind of warning message should be displayed.

I don't see any cookies in this example. Probably does use the users' cookies so the page data might have personalized stuff (e.g. gmail or your bank).

We should only accept http/https urls from external apps or the QR code scanner

Hi Daniel, You can get the cookies by making QR with the following string `javascript:alert(document.cookie)`

the above exploit meant to be alert the page source from google.com

Testing it further it turns out to get `javascript` code execution on reading mode and on local files

Please check the attached video POC

1. Javascript code execution in reading mode [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V7dd9exVbQer61k1ZRISRLFc1tGSybEG)

This bug also works when the CSP is implemented as well.

#### Vulnerable-page.php

```
<?php

header("Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'");

if(isset($_GET['xss'])) {

    echo $_GET['xss'];
}

?>

```
#### String to generate QR

```
javascript:try{alert(document.domain)}catch(e){alert(e.message)}

```

Hello folks, is their any updates on the fix?

FYI: The same vulnerability reported to other browser vendors as well, they are planning to release advisory in next month.

Can you paste in the links or reference numbers to other browser's bugs? I understand they will be private for now but will be helpful later or if we need to contact them about it.

Garvan: will this be fixed by the "bookmarklet" change you recently landed? If not this is the same kind of thing: we should never accept javascript links from anywhere, except where the webview itself handles it in web content. Shouldn't accept non-http(s) links from QR codes or other external sources.

If this is the same mark it "fixed, depends on" so we can properly evaluate the bounty claim.

Since this has been fixed can we go ahead and request CVE and bounty for this bug?
