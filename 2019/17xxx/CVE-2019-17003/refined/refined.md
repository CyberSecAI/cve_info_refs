Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17003:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper parsing of QR codes in the Firefox for iOS address bar. Specifically, the browser was not correctly handling `javascript:` URLs embedded within QR codes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By encoding malicious JavaScript within a QR code, an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser session when the user scans the QR code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The browser failed to properly sanitize or validate the data extracted from the QR code, leading to the execution of the malicious JavaScript.
*   **Insecure Handling of `javascript:` URLs:** The browser's handling of `javascript:` URLs from external sources (QR codes, in this case) was insecure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cookie Stealing/Data Theft:** The attacker can execute JavaScript code, potentially stealing cookies, session data, and other sensitive information from the current domain.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could execute arbitrary code within the browser context, allowing a wide range of malicious activities.
*   **Same-Origin Policy Violations:** The vulnerability can lead to same-origin policy violations, where the attacker could gain unauthorized access to resources within the user's browser session.
*   **Bypassing CSP:** The vulnerability was demonstrated to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **QR Code Scanning:** The attack vector involves generating a malicious QR code that contains a `javascript:` URL. When a user scans this QR code with the Firefox for iOS browser, the embedded JavaScript is executed.
*   **External Sources:** The vulnerability is triggered when the browser accepts a `javascript:` URL from an external source like QR codes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Generate QR Codes:** The attacker needs to be able to generate QR codes. This can be achieved through various online QR code generators or custom tools.
*   **Social Engineering/User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into scanning the malicious QR code using the Firefox for iOS browser.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   The bug was initially reported as "Improper parsing of QR codes in address bar" and later updated to "Improper parsing of QR codes in address bar leads to XSS".
*   The vulnerability was found to be exploitable in reading mode and on local files as well.
*   The issue was fixed by removing javascript URL support from external sources, specifically in the context of bug 1588928.
*   This vulnerability was assigned the CVE ID CVE-2019-17003.
*   This bug is a duplicate of bug 1659333
