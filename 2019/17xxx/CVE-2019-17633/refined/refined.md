The provided content relates to CVE-2019-17633.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in Eclipse Che's web interface when authentication and TLS are disabled (single-user mode).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of CSRF protection in Eclipse Che's API endpoints. Specifically, the API does not check the Origin header or require a session token/cookie for requests.
- Single-user mode in Eclipse Che does not have authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can create and launch arbitrary containers on the same machine running the vulnerable Che instance.
- Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code within the container, leading to further compromise of the host system.
- Attackers could control the Che server and start containers locally, allowing them to perform malicious activities within the Che environment or on the host system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker hosts a malicious website that contains JavaScript code.
- When a victim visits the malicious website while also running a vulnerable instance of Eclipse Che in single-user mode on the same machine, the JavaScript code on the website sends POST requests to the Che instance.
- Since there are no CSRF protections, the requests are executed by the Che server, leading to the creation of containers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious web page accessible to the victim.
- The victim needs to be running Eclipse Che in single-user mode, with no authentication/authorization and no TLS enabled.
- The victim needs to access the malicious website while also running the vulnerable Che instance.
- The victim's browser must be able to make requests to the Che instance (typically over HTTP). The attacker does not need to have access to the che server itself.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable versions are Eclipse Che versions 6.16.0 to 7.3.0.
- The fix was included in versions 7.3.1 and 7.4.0.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
- The attack can succeed if the victim has Che open on the same network, even if port 8080 is only open locally.
- The provided proof of concept (POC) is an HTML file demonstrating the attack.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Michael Grube.
