The provided content is related to the fix for CVE-2019-17579. This commit addresses a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in project links within the SonarQube application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way project links were rendered. Specifically, the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag was not properly sanitized, which allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization/encoding of user-provided link URLs, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the page when a user views project links. This can allow attackers to perform a range of actions including:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing session cookies to impersonate users.
  - Data exfiltration: Accessing and stealing sensitive data from the SonarQube instance.
  - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the web page.
  - Redirection: Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted URLs: An attacker could create a project link with a malicious URL.
- User interaction:  An unsuspecting user viewing the project page would trigger the malicious script execution when their browser tries to render the unsafe link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create project links: The attacker needs the ability to create or modify project links in SonarQube, often requiring some degree of access to the platform.
- User interaction:  The attacker also relies on another user viewing the page containing the malicious link.
