{
  "CVE-2019-17570": {
    "description": "The XMLRPC client in libxmlrpc3-java, an XML-RPC implementation in Java, does perform deserialization of the server-side exception serialized in the faultCause attribute of XMLRPC error response messages. A malicious XMLRPC server can take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of an application using the Apache XMLRPC client library.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the XMLRPC client's deserialization of the server-side exception contained within the faultCause attribute of XMLRPC error response messages, specifically when the enabledForExceptions property is set.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization of untrusted data",
        "Lack of input validation or sanitization of the faultCause attribute"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a client using the vulnerable library, with the privileges of the application using the XMLRPC client library.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious XMLRPC server sends a crafted XMLRPC error response to the vulnerable client.",
        "The error response contains a faultCause attribute with a serialized Java object payload."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control an XMLRPC server that communicates with a vulnerable XMLRPC client. The client needs to have the `enabledForExceptions` property set to true if it intends to receive server-side exceptions."
