Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17358:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an unsafe deserialization issue in the `sanitize_unserialize_selected_items` function located in `lib/functions.php` within Cacti. This function inadequately sanitizes user-provided input before deserializing it using the `unserialize` function in PHP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unsafe Deserialization:** The core weakness is the use of the `unserialize` function on user-controlled data without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `sanitize_unserialize_selected_items` function lacks robust validation, failing to prevent the deserialization of potentially dangerous objects. Specifically, it does not properly check for malicious objects.
*   **Missing checks for objects**: The original code did a basic check for array values, but did not check if the string contained an object. The patch adds a check for strings containing objects, by using a regular expression (`preg_match('/(^|;|{|})O:\+?[0-9]+:"/', $unstripped)`)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious serialized objects, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Application Logic Abuse:** Attackers could manipulate object data and control the application's behavior, leading to unexpected and potentially harmful actions within the Cacti system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could also be exploited to cause a denial-of-service by triggering a memory corruption or other resource exhaustion issue in the PHP module during deserialization.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attacks:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as the malicious data can be supplied through HTTP requests.
*   **Authenticated Attacks**: Exploitation requires an authenticated user, but can lead to remote execution of code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account in Cacti to exploit the vulnerability, though the privilege level of the account required is low. 
*   **Network access:** Ability to send requests to the Cacti application.
*   **Understanding of PHP unserialization:** The attacker would need knowledge of PHP object serialization to construct a malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources confirm this vulnerability in Cacti versions up to 1.2.7.
*   Patches were implemented to address this vulnerability, including adding checks for objects within the string to be deserialized using regular expressions.
*   The vulnerability exists in the `sanitize_unserialize_selected_items` function in the `lib/functions.php` file.
*   Various Linux distributions released security updates to address this vulnerability, as described in multiple advisories.
*   The vulnerability is referenced in multiple bug trackers and security mailing lists, including Debian, SUSE, Gentoo, and Ubuntu.
*   The fix has been implemented in `Cacti` version `1.2.11` and later.
