  "CVE-2019-17021": {
    "description": "During the initialization of a new content process, a race condition occurs that can allow a content process to disclose heap addresses from the parent process. *Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.4 and Firefox < 72.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A race condition exists during new process bootstrapping where a compromised renderer can read policy entry pointers before they are updated, disclosing broker heap addresses.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Race Condition",
        "Information Disclosure",
        "Improper Access Control"
      ],
       "impact": "A compromised renderer process can leak the broker process's heap addresses. This information can be used to bypass memory protection technologies (ASLR) to facilitate additional LPE/RCE vulnerabilities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A compromised renderer process exploits the race condition during new content process initialization on Windows.",
           "By triggering the initialization of new processes through normal browser interaction such as opening new tabs"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs arbitrary code execution within a compromised renderer process and the ability to open new tabs in the browser."
    },
      "affected_products": [
      "Firefox ESR < 68.4",
      "Firefox < 72",
      "MozillaThunderbird (versions specified in SUSE advisories)"
  ],
    "additional_information": {
        "patch_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a patch that handles the race condition in CopyPolicyToTarget to update policy entry pointers before allowing the renderer to interact with them, this patch is included in bug 1599005.",
