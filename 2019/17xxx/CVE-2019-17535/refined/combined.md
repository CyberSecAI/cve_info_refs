# Gila CMS Reflected XSS

October 12, 2019

Versions prior to and including 1.11.4 of Gila CMS are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting. On line 29 and 30 of the `blog-list.php` view found in both the `gila-blog` and `gila-mag` themes, the value of the user provided search criteria is printed back to the response without any sanitisation. This can result in cross-site scripting as can be seen in the below screenshot:

![](/assets/images/2019-10-12-gila-cms-reflected-xss/gila-reflected-xss.png)

Additionally, as HTTP only cookies are not in use, this can lead to a compromise of an admin session and lead to a takeover of the CMS.

## Proof of Concept

`http://gila.host/?search=xss%22+onfocus%3D%22console.log%28document.domain%29%22+autofocus%3D%22true`

## Versions Affected

<= 1.11.4

## Solution

Update to a version later than 1.11.4 or apply the patch found at <https://github.com/GilaCMS/gila/pull/48>

### @rastating **[rastating](/rastating)** commented [Oct 12, 2019](#issue-506235517)

In the `blog-list.php` view of both themes included in Gila (gila-blog and gila-mag), there is a lack of HTML entity encoding, which leads to reflected cross-site scripting being possible in the search results.

An example of this can be in the console of the screenshot below when visiting the URL: `/?search=xss%22+onfocus%3D%22console.log%28document.domain%29%22+autofocus%3D%22true`

[![Screenshot from 2019-10-12 21-31-06](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66707481-2c14f300-ed39-11e9-89c9-7adc3009c3d8.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66707481-2c14f300-ed39-11e9-89c9-7adc3009c3d8.png)

This pull request fixes both instances of this by parsing the user input through `htmlentities` first.

Sorry, something went wrong.
