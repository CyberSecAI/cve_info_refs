- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in the `get_image_url()` function during the bootstrap stage of Bitdefender BOX 2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** OS Command Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary system commands. The CVSS score indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is in the bootstrap stage of Bitdefender BOX 2 and can be triggered by manipulating the `get_image_url()` function. The network attack vector (AV:N) suggests it is likely remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated (PR:N) and no user interaction is required (UI:N). However, the attack complexity is high (AC:H), suggesting some preconditions or specific circumstances are required for successful exploitation.
