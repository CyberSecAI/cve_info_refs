{
  "CVE-2019-17357": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in `graphs.php` when handling `template_id` parameters, leading to SQL injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database. In some cases, unauthenticated attackers could exploit this via CSRF.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user is needed to directly exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. CSRF can be leveraged by unauthenticated attackers if a user with a valid session can be tricked into submitting a malicious request."
  },
  "CVE-2019-17358": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from unsafe deserialization of user-controlled data in `lib/functions.php`, specifically in the `sanitize_unserialize_selected_items` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe Deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "An authenticated attacker could manipulate object data values, control actions within Cacti, and potentially trigger memory corruption in the PHP module.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated attacker is needed to exploit this vulnerability."
  },
   "CVE-2019-16723": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authorization checks in `graph_json.php` when processing the `local_graph_id` parameter, allowing unauthorized access to graph data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authorization Bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Authenticated users can bypass authorization checks and view graphs they are not supposed to access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An authenticated user is required, but does not need special privileges."
  },
   "CVE-2020-7106": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues in multiple files (`data_sources.php`, `color_templates_item.php`, `graphs.php`, `graph_items.php`, `lib/api_automation.php`, `user_admin.php`, `user_group_admin.php`) where data from the database isn't properly escaped, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed by other users accessing the affected pages, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "No specific user privilege is required, the attacker just need to inject the XSS payload to the database."
  },
   "CVE-2020-7237": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to shell metacharacters being used in the 'Performance Boost Debug Log' field of `poller_automation.php`, which leads to Remote Code Execution during the poller cycle.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Remote Code Execution"
    ],
     "impact": "Privileged users can execute arbitrary OS commands by injecting shell metacharacters into the affected field.",
