{
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow in `sn_coap_builder_calc_needed_packet_data_size_2` when adding `returned_byte_count` and `src_coap_msg_ptr->payload_len` (both `uint16_t`) leading to an insufficient buffer allocation. This results in out-of-bounds memory access during message construction.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Integer overflow leading to insufficient buffer allocation. Out-of-bounds memory access. Memory corruption",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Memory corruption. This can cause a denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted CoAP messages with a specific size can trigger the integer overflow. An attacker can send such messages to a vulnerable device.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted CoAP message to a device using the vulnerable library."
