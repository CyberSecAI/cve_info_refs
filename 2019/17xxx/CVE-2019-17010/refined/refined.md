## Analysis of CVE-2019-17010

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17010:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided text mentions `CVE-2019-17010` in the context of a use-after-free vulnerability related to device orientation checks. This is in line with the official CVE description, indicating that the content is relevant.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a **race condition** that occurs during device orientation checks, specifically while checking the 'Resist Fingerprinting' preference. This race condition can lead to a **use-after-free** scenario.

The vulnerable code lies in `mozilla::EventListenerManager::AddEventListenerInternal`, which is triggered by `nsDeviceSensors::IsSensorAllowedByPref`, where the race condition happens when trying to access the document object which might already be gone.

The vulnerability occurs due to a timing issue between checking for the "Resist Fingerprinting" preference and potentially creating or freeing the objects associated with device orientation, resulting in an invalid pointer access.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-after-free:**  A memory location is accessed after it has been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential exploitation.
*   **Race condition:**  Multiple threads or processes accessing shared resources in an uncoordinated manner can lead to unexpected and erroneous results. In this case, there's a race between a thread that might free memory and one that might be accessing it.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The vulnerability results in a crash, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code. It is also noted that this could lead to a Denial-of-Service.
*  **Information Disclosure**: The advisory on www.mozilla.org notes the vulnerability could potentially result in a cross-origin information leak via dragging and dropping a cross origin resource.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves triggering device orientation events while the 'Resist Fingerprinting' preference is being checked. Specifically, the `ondeviceorientation` event and also the `onstorage` events are mentioned.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the device orientation events, specifically via JavaScript code in a web page or an extension with permissions to add these events.
*   The attacker does not necessarily need to be local as the vulnerability is triggered by web content that can be accessed remotely via a crafted web page.

**Additional Details from Content:**

*   The vulnerability is described as "sec-moderate".
*   The fix involves ensuring the check for "Resist Fingerprinting" is done using the principal of the window rather than the docshell to avoid accessing freed memory when docshell no longer exists and parent objects are gone.
*   A patch was developed and tested on the nightly channel for several days.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Firefox 71, Firefox ESR 68.3 and Thunderbird 68.3.
*   There was difficulty in creating a reliable test case.
*   The `onstorage` event also has a similar vulnerability which was later tracked in bug 1591334
*   The bug also affects Thunderbird, but it is noted that since scripting is disabled when reading email in the application it reduces the risk via email.
*   The openSUSE security advisory indicates that this was fixed in `openSUSE Leap 15.1` via the `openSUSE-SU-2020:0002-1` security update.
* The Ubuntu Security Notice `USN-4241-1` and `USN-4335-1` also mention this CVE as being fixed via updated packages.
* The Red Hat Security advisory `RHSA-2020:0295` mentions this CVE as fixed for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions.
* The Red Hat security advisory `RHSA-2019:4107`  , `RHSA-2019:4108` , `RHSA-2019:4111` mention this CVE as a fix for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6,7 and 8.
