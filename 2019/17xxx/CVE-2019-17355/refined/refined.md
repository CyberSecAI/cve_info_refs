{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Usernames and passwords were being logged during authentication.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Sensitive information (usernames and passwords) were being written to the system log (Logcat). This log was accessible to other applications on the same device, especially on older Android versions (prior to Jelly Bean) that lacked proper permission controls.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers could obtain user credentials (username and password) by accessing the system logs (Logcat). This would allow the attacker to take over user accounts.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability could be exploited by monitoring the Logcat output. This could be done by a malicious application installed on the same Android device as the vulnerable app. Older Android versions, lacking proper permission controls, are especially susceptible.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need the ability to access the system log (Logcat) on the device where the vulnerable Orbitz app was installed. This would typically be achieved by having another app installed on the same device. For older Android versions, no special permissions would be needed."
