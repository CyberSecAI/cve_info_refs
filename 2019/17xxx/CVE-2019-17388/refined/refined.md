Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-17388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in overly permissive file permissions set on the installation directory of the Aviatrix VPN client during the installation process on Windows, Linux, and FreeBSD.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Weak File Permissions:** The installation script recursively applies world-writable permissions (777) to the installation directory on Linux and FreeBSD. On Windows, the installer grants read-write permissions to "Everyone" on the application's directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with local access to a machine can exploit these weak permissions to modify scripts or replace the service executable, leading to code execution with elevated privileges.
   - On Linux/FreeBSD, an attacker could modify the scripts executed by the openvpn command when a VPN connection is established/terminated, causing the script to run as root.
   - On Windows, an attacker can replace the service executable (AVPNC_RP.exe) with a malicious one, causing it to run as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM when the service is started.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the machine where the Aviatrix VPN client is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have some level of access to the machine, even if not administrative. They require the ability to write to the installation directory of the VPN client.
- For Windows, the attacker needs the ability to stop and restart the service, which requires administrative privileges or the appropriate permissions to restart the service if not running as an administrator.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Immersive Labs researcher Alex Seymour.
- The vulnerability affects Windows, Linux and FreeBSD versions of the Aviatrix VPN client.
- The macOS version of the client was not affected due to permissions being set non-recursively.
- Aviatrix released a patch (v2.4.10) to address the vulnerability.
- Immersive Labs has a free lab available for users to explore the vulnerability.
