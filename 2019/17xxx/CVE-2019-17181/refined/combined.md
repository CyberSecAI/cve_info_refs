IntraSrv - Simple Web Server

## IntraSrv - Simple Web Server

[intrasrv.exe](intrasrv.zip) (stored in intrasrv.zip - 30,310) Console Application (Win/NT/2000/XP/V as is - see note [below](#intrasrvbelow) for Win/9x/ME/NT) ![](updated.gif) 2007/06/03

This is a small web server that you can run to allow a directory and all its subdirectories to be accessible via a web browser. You will only want to do this on a local network (LAN) that is protected by a [hardware firewall](http://www.firewallguide.com/hardware.htm) (such as a Linksys or D-Link Firewall Router). This little web server was built from the **Visual C - wsrv** at [Web Programming with Sockets](http://www.schaik.com/download/sockets.html).

The advantage of this web server approach is that you can keep your disk drives as not shared, yet open read only access to a directory tree. This program also defaults to a directory listing rather than index.html if no file is given, which makes it easy to browse for the desired file(s) to download. The **default directory** is \shared on the same drive as intrasrv.exe, but you can use the -r command line flag to point to **another directory** (and its subdirectories). You can even use the -p flag to listen at a different **port** and the -v flag to watch what's being requested. You can make access more secure by using -u to set a **user** name and -P to set a **password** - the usual browser login dialog will be presented upon first access by a browser.

Usage is
intrasrv -? | [-v] [-i] [-h] [-p <port>] [-r <root>] [-u <username>] [-P <password>] [-R <ipLevel>]

where+ -p port-number to listen (default 80)+ -r root directory (\shared)+ -u user name (default: any user)+ -P password (requires -u; default: none)+ -R level of IP addr to match (0 <= level <= 4, default: 3)+ -h show hidden directories (but NOT hidden files)+ -i for dirs without .htaccess, send index.html instead of dir listing+ -v verbose showing incoming requests+ -? this help-message

C:\Example>intrasrv -v -p 8008 -r c:\temp -u georgew -P 1776july4th

**intrasrv** will generate a "CMD" button next to the header's directory path for directory listing pages if the request comes from the same computer that intrasrv is running on. Clicking this button will open a Command Prompt (aka Dos Box) logged to the directory you are viewing.

By default, **intrasrv** restricts access to your local subnet (computers whose IP address numbers match the 1st 3 sets of numbers for your computer). You can use the -R command line flag to tighten this restriction (-R 4) to allow only your own computer or to loosen this restriction to allow more IP addresses:

| 192.168.1.100 = Your IP address - which is always allowed | | | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cmd line flag: | -R 4 | -R 3 (default) | -R 2 | -R 1 | -R 0 || 192.168.1.101 | not allowed | allowed | allowed | allowed | allowed |
| 192.168.2.101 | not allowed | not allowed | allowed | allowed | allowed |
| 123.168.1.101 | not allowed | not allowed | not allowed | not allowed | allowed |

If someone outside the allowed IP addresses attempts to access **intrasrv**, they receive a password dialog - but there is no valid username and password that will let them in.

**intrasrv** can be configured to act like a normal web server by using the **-i** command line flag. When -i is given, and an incoming URL is for a directory rather than a file, a directory listing is returned **only** if the directory contains a file (or directory) named **.htaccess**; otherwise **index.html** is returned (or a 403 Forbidden error if there is no index.html in the directory).

Older Windows systems (at least Win95/98) have an incomplete "Services" file. Look for it in C:\Windows\ or one of its subdirectories. In NT4 Services resides in "...\drivers\etc". What is missing is an entry for http; therefore, using Notepad, after the entry for finger add a line with "http 80/tcp" - intrasrv.exe relies on this entry.

| OLD |  | NEW |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ``` finger     79/tcp  kerberos   88/tcp ``` | ```          ``` | ``` finger     79/tcp http       80/tcp kerberos   88/tcp ``` |

**intrasrv** will also work with a SSL Wrapper like [stunnel](http://www.stunnel.org/) to provide **https** support. There is nothing to do to configure **intrasrv** itself; you can configure [stunnel](http://www.stunnel.org/) as follows:

* Download and install [stunnel](http://www.stunnel.org/).* Create a configuration file for stunnel. The following will establish a default configuration:
    [vpn]

    accept = 192.168.1.100:443

    connect = 192.168.1.100:80

    TIMEOUTclose = 0The number 192.168.1.100 is the **Dotted Address** value given in your **intrasrv** startup message.* Start stunnel. You can use a batch file like
      start /b cmd /c "C:\Program Files\stunnel\stunnel.exe" C:\fullpath\required\stunnel.dat* Start **intrasrv** with -p set to the port given after the colon in the connect line above.* Point your browser at https://192.168.1.100:443 (or whatever you have on the accept line above).

Note that ports 80 and 443 are the standard HTTP and HTTPS ports; you can easily modify the stunnel configuration file to point to less well know ports such as

[vpn]

accept = 192.168.1.100:8443

connect = 192.168.1.100:8080

TIMEOUTclose = 0

Then start **intrasrv** like

intrasrv -p 8080 -r c:\sharedfolder -u username -P PassW0rd
and point your browser at

https://192.168.1.100:8443
If you are ignoring the advice in the first paragraph and opening a hole in your firewall, it is **strongly** recommended that you not use the standard ports! Of course, **intrasrv** doesn't have much security builtin, so opening your firewall to **intrasrv** is not recommended - there is even an [SEH Based Remote Code Execution flaw that is documented](http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25836/). Also note that you will need to set the -R 0 command line flag to open **intrasrv** to accepting requests from all IP addresses (all computers); the default -R 3 value restricts accepted requests to just your subnet.

[wgetall.exe](wgetall.zip) (stored in wgetall.zip - 22,191) Console Application ![](updated.gif) 2007/09/29

This program will download a file via HTTP, save it in the current directory, then download all the files pointed to by downloaded file. It is primarily intended to use with IntraSrv to grab all the files pointed to by a page IntraSrv is displaying. But it can also be used to grab all the files pointed to by any HTML page on the internet (currently there is no support for cgi, php, asp, etc. pages).

Usage is wgetall -? | [-f <file>] [-1] <url>

where+ -f file in which the initial web-page is saved+ -g optionally also get graphics that are embeded in the <url> page [ downloads "imagefilename" from <img src="imagefilename"> tags ]+ -1 optionally get only the <url> and don't get any files linked from it+ -? this help-message

It works by downloading the initial file, saving it, and then parsing that file and downloading each href string by calling itself with the -1 flag.
All files are stored in the same directory from which wgetall was run.
