{
  "CVE-2019-17181": {
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "Root cause": "A remote SEH buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the IntraSrv 1.0 web server.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "The server does not properly handle the length of the 'Host' header in an HTTP request, leading to a buffer overflow when the header is excessively large."
      ],
      "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the hosting system, leading to complete control over the vulnerable machine.",
        "Attack vectors": [
          "The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP GET or HEAD request to the webserver with an oversized 'Host' header field."
        ],
        "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the vulnerable server; no authentication is required. The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the server. The attacker has to have the knowledge of how to create a crafted HTTP request to exploit the overflow.",
	"Affected Component": "IntraSrv 1.0 web server"
