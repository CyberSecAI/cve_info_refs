  "CVE-2019-17054": {
    "description": "The Appletalk network protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.",

    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient permission checks"
    ],
    "impact": "A local unprivileged attacker could create a raw socket, allowing them to send arbitrary packets on networks using the Appletalk protocol.",
