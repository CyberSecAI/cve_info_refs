Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17001:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of Content Security Policy (CSP) by the `<object>` tag, specifically when `script-src 'none'` is set in the CSP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSP Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the `script-src 'none'` directive of the Content Security Policy. This policy should prevent execution of inline scripts, but the `<object>` tag did not correctly enforce it.
- **Incorrect CSP Inheritance:** The `<object>` tag, when used with `javascript:` or `data:` URIs, did not inherit or apply the parent document's CSP correctly in Firefox 69.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Successful exploitation leads to XSS, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web page. This can lead to stealing user cookies, manipulating the page content, and performing other malicious actions.
- **Complete CSP bypass**: The vulnerability allows the execution of javascript even when `script-src 'none'` is set in the CSP, thus completely bypassing it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Object Tag with `javascript:` or `data:` URI:** The attack involves using an `<object>` tag with a `javascript:` or `data:` URI that contains malicious JavaScript.
   -  `data="javascript:alert(document.cookie)"`
   -  `data="data:text/html,<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>"`
- **Cross-Origin Frame:** Although not explicitly required, the vulnerability occurs in cross-origin frames, but it affects the parent frame by allowing the execution of injected javascript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject HTML:** The attacker needs the ability to inject HTML into a web page, either through an existing vulnerability (e.g., XSS) or by controlling a website.
- **Targeted Browser:** The vulnerability specifically affected Firefox 69 and was not present in earlier versions.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was a regression caused by a refactoring effort where the CSP was moved from `nsIPrincipal` to the `Client`, in [bug 965637](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=965637).
- The fix for this issue was introduced in [bug 1555043](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1555043).
- The vulnerability was resolved in Firefox 70.
- This is a separate bypass from CVE-2019-17000, which is also related to CSP bypass using object tag, but in cases where data: URIs were allowed.
- The bug was reported by Matheus Vrech.

In summary, CVE-2019-17001 allowed attackers to bypass CSP restrictions in Firefox 69 through the `<object>` tag, enabling XSS attacks by injecting malicious scripts using `javascript:` or `data:` URIs, which violated the `script-src 'none'` policy. The issue was fixed in Firefox 70 and did not affect other versions.
