  "CVE-2019-17068": {
    "Description": "PuTTY before 0.73 mishandles the \"bracketed paste mode\" protection mechanism, which may allow a session to be affected by malicious clipboard content.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient handling of terminal escape sequences in bracketed paste mode.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Mishandling of bracketed paste mode protection mechanism"
    ],
    "Impact": "Malicious clipboard content can affect a session, potentially leading to the execution of unintended commands or data corruption.",
        "Attack vectors": [
      "Malicious clipboard content",
	  "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to control clipboard content"
    ],
	"Additional Information": "The terminal escape sequences that should delimit the pasted data were appearing together on one side of it, making it possible to misidentify pasted data as manual keyboard input."
