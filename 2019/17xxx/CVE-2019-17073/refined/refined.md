RELATED: CVE-2019-17073
  
- Vulnerability: Arbitrary file deletion
- Root cause: The admin/template.php script allows unauthenticated file deletion due to insufficient input validation in the $tplName parameter, which is used in the emDeleteFile function. The emDeleteFile function recursively deletes files and directories without restricting directory traversal characters like "../".
- Weakness:
  - Unrestricted use of directory traversal characters ("../").
  - Insufficient validation of user-supplied input.
- Attack vector: By crafting a malicious URL with the action set to 'del' and the tpl parameter containing directory traversal sequences, an attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server.
- Impact: Arbitrary file deletion can lead to denial of service, data loss, or potentially complete compromise of the system.
- Required capabilities: The attacker must be able to access the admin/template.php script and obtain a valid login token for authentication.
- POC: /emlog/admin/template.php?action=del&tpl=../../index.php&token={U login token}
