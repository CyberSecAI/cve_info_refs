{
  "CVE-2019-17351": {
    "root_cause": "The Linux kernel does not limit the amount of memory used for grant table and foreign mappings, potentially leading to memory exhaustion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of limits on memory ballooning for foreign/grant mappings.",
       "Absence of restrictions on the amount of \"foreign/grant map\" memory a guest can consume."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can crash backend Linux domains or cause a denial of service by exhausting backend memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted requests from a malicious guest to consume excessive foreign/grant map memory.",
       "Exploiting the lack of limits on memory ballooning."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "A malicious guest with the ability to send crafted requests to a backend Linux domain."
