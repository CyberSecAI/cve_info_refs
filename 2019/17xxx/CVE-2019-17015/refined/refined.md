{
  "CVE-2019-17015": {
    "Description": "During the initialization of a new content process, a pointer offset can be manipulated leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash in the parent process.  This issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.",
    "Root cause": "A race condition during the initialization of a new content process allows manipulation of a pointer offset due to a shared memory handle being duplicated before initialization is complete.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Race condition",
      "Out-of-bounds read/write",
	  "Memory corruption"
    ],
    "Impact": "Memory corruption in the broker process, leading to a potentially exploitable crash and potential sandbox escape/LPE.",
    "Attack vectors": "Exploitation requires code execution within a sandboxed renderer process and the ability to trigger the race condition during new process bootstrapping.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Attacker needs code execution in a sandboxed renderer process on Windows and to trigger the race condition. Due to the USER_LIMITED token, any renderer process can interact with other renderer processes and duplicate shared memory handles. No specific information disclosure is required."
