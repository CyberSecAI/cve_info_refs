- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `/api/update_setup` API method in the Bitdefender BOX v2 recovery partition does not perform firmware signature checks atomically, leading to a Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) race condition.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** TOCTTOU race condition, lack of atomic firmware signature checks, exploitable command execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary execution of system commands.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the `/api/update_setup` API method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be on the same network (Adjacent) and exploit the race condition.
