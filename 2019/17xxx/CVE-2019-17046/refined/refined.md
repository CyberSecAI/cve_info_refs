{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Ilch CMS allows a user with admin privileges to upload files with a .php extension through the 'Media' module settings. This, combined with a Local File Inclusion vulnerability, leads to Remote Code Execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure file upload: The application allows uploading of files with executable extensions (e.g., .php).",
      "Local file inclusion (LFI): The application includes files based on user-controlled input without proper validation.",
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can upload malicious PHP files and execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control over the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker needs administrator access to the Ilch CMS to modify the allowed file extensions within the Media module settings to include .php. ",
       "Once a PHP file is uploaded, the attacker uses the LFI vulnerability to execute the malicious code by accessing the uploaded PHP file via the browser."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires valid admin credentials to access the CMS's administrative panel. The attacker also needs to understand how to upload files and craft malicious PHP code."
