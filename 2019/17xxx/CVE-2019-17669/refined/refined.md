Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17669:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue within the `wp_http_validate_url()` function.
- The URL validation process does not properly account for the interpretation of a hostname as a series of hexadecimal characters. Specifically, the `gethostbyname()` function can interpret a string as hex characters which can lead to unexpected hostname resolution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):**  The primary weakness is that a crafted URL can trick the server into making requests to internal or unintended resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to probe internal services, access sensitive data, or initiate requests from the server on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a specially formatted URL that is processed by the vulnerable `wp_http_validate_url()` function during a request. The attacker would need to provide a hostname that is interpreted as a sequence of hexadecimal characters.
- The vulnerability is in how WordPress validates URLs, specifically in the `wp_http_validate_url()` function within `wp-includes/http.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a URL to a part of the application that uses the vulnerable `wp_http_validate_url()` function for validation. This could occur via various input methods such as user profiles, or when loading external resources.
- No user authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The fix for this vulnerability involves checking if `gethostbyname()` returns the same value as the provided host, in which case the validation process should return `false`. This fix was introduced in changeset 46475.

```

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 5.2.4 (as well as older versions of 5.1, etc).
- The commit `608d39f` on GitHub references this fix and it is described as "HTTP API: Protect against hex interpretation."
- The fix ensures that an error condition from `gethostbyname` which arises when the input string is resolved as hex values is handled by returning early from the function to prevent SSRF.
