This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

#### [#CVE-2019-17015: Memory corruption in parent process during new content process initialization on Windows](#CVE-2019-17015)

Reporter
Thomas Imbert
Impact
high
##### Description

During the initialization of a new content process, a pointer offset can be manipulated leading to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash in the parent process.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1599005](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599005)

#### [#CVE-2019-17016: Bypass of @namespace CSS sanitization during pasting](#CVE-2019-17016)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
high
##### Description

When pasting a `<style>` tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer incorrectly rewrites a @namespace rule. This could allow for injection into certain types of websites resulting in data exfiltration.

##### References

* [Bug 1599181](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599181)

#### [#CVE-2019-17017: Type Confusion in XPCVariant.cpp](#CVE-2019-17017)

Reporter
bo13oy
Impact
high
##### Description

Due to a missing case handling object types, a type confusion vulnerability could occur, resulting in a crash. We presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

* [Bug 1603055](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1603055)

#### [#CVE-2019-17018: Windows Keyboard in Private Browsing Mode may retain word suggestions](#CVE-2019-17018)

Reporter
Siye Lui
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When in Private Browsing Mode on Windows 10, the Windows keyboard may retain word suggestions to improve the accuracy of the keyboard.

##### References

* [Bug 1549394](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1549394)

#### [#CVE-2019-17019: Python files could be inadvertently executed upon opening a download](#CVE-2019-17019)

Reporter
Prithwish Kumar Pal
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When Python was installed on Windows, a python file being served with the MIME type of `text/plain` could be executed by Python instead of being opened as a text file when the Open option was selected upon download.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1568003](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568003)

#### [#CVE-2019-17020: Content Security Policy not applied to XSL stylesheets applied to XML documents](#CVE-2019-17020)

Reporter
Matthew Somerville
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If an XML file is served with a Content Security Policy and the XML file includes an XSL stylesheet, the Content Security Policy will not be applied to the contents of the XSL stylesheet. If the XSL sheet e.g. includes JavaScript, it would bypass any of the restrictions of the Content Security Policy applied to the XML document.

* [Bug 1597645](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1597645)

#### [#CVE-2019-17021: Heap address disclosure in parent process during content process initialization on Windows](#CVE-2019-17021)

Reporter
Thomas Imbert
Impact
moderate
##### Description

During the initialization of a new content process, a race condition occurs that can allow a content process to disclose heap addresses from the parent process.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Windows. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1599008](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1599008)

#### [#CVE-2019-17022: CSS sanitization does not escape HTML tags](#CVE-2019-17022)

Reporter
Michał Bentkowski
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When pasting a `<style>` tag from the clipboard into a rich text editor, the CSS sanitizer does not escape < and > characters. Because the resulting string is pasted directly into the text node of the element this does not result in a direct injection into the webpage; however, if a webpage subsequently copies the node's innerHTML, assigning it to another innerHTML, this would result in an XSS vulnerability. Two WYSIWYG editors were identified with this behavior, more may exist.

##### References

* [Bug 1602843](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1602843)

Hello,

There is a Type confusion between BigInt and Object Vulnerability in Firefox.

Tested Platforms:

1)Ubuntu 64-bit 16.04.3 (Memory 8G)+ firefox release version nightly 71.0 (64-bit)

When using firefox to load the poc.html, it manifests itself in the form of the following crash:

Unsure if this should go in JS or DOM bindings land, as at least the PoC seems to rely on the `any` type webidl parameter in `XSLTProcessor`'s `setParameter` method. I don't know if this would affect basically all the APIs in a [query roughly like this](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/search?q=any%28...%29%3F+%5Ba-z%5D*%5B%29%2C%5D&case=false&regexp=true&path=%2Fwebidl%2F*.webidl)...

Jan, can you help confirm whether there's 1 or more issues here and where it belongs?

Thanks for reporting. This is a good find.

Code in XPConnect is [doing this](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/690e903ef689a4eca335b96bd903580394864a1c/js/xpconnect/src/XPCVariant.cpp#187):

```
    } else {
      MOZ_ASSERT(val.isObject(), "invalid type of jsval!");
      jsobj = &val.toObject();

```

It doesn't account for the new BigInt type.

I'll fix this to use ValueType with a switch-statement.

We should also audit the code for similar issues elsewhere.

— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9115167&action=edit)

Ideally this code would use JS::ValueType with a switch-statement and rely on

compiler exhaustiveness checking, but this is the safer patch.

[Bug 1603055](/show_bug.cgi?id=1603055 "RESOLVED FIXED - BigInt and Object type confusion vulnerability exploitable via XSLTProcessor setParameter method") - Handle BigInt values in XPCVariant code. r?bholley!

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Pretty easy. It points to BigInt values not being handled and then you could see where this code is used.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: [Bug 1527902](/show_bug.cgi?id=1527902 "RESOLVED FIXED - Enable javascript.options.bigint by default")
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Should apply.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Very unlikely.

jandem: what's your holiday work schedule? how late could you land this in December (Soft freeze is Jan 2)?

jcristau: how late is RelMan comfortable having this land? It's a simple "missed case" fix, which should be extremely low risk. But it's also kind of obvious should someone see the patch go by, and Type Confusion has been the main bug class we've seen abused in practice the last several years (multiple Pwn2Own winners and the "Coinbase" 0-day).

I'm totally on board with sec-approval+, just want to have a date nailed down. Would love to have this land between Christmas and New Year's if possible, the closer to the soft freeze the better.

I'll take PTO but I'll be (near) home most of that time and will likely be checking in on email etc anyway, so I'm happy to land this whenever.

January 1st?

This could go directly into the RC with minimal risk. Would prefer the 29th but could live with the 26th. That's Boxing Day in the UK and Canada, don't know if that's a common thing elsewhere in Europe. Would there be sheriffs around to do a `checkin-needed`?

sec-approval to land as close to the release as jandem and jcristau can negotiate, preferably after Christmas.

Chrome is expected to fix a privacy leak from Incognito mode to normal browsing via the keyboard learning autocomplete data and exposing it in the normal browsing context. See <https://hothardware.com/news/micrsoft-chromium-fixes> (latter part).

Basically, we should be using IS\_PRIVATE as the input scope in Private Browsing on windows to avoid the Win10 keyboard from learning from input and offering as corrections or autocomplete data when we're not in Private Browsing.

See <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/inputscope/ne-inputscope-inputscope>

AFAICT this would need to live in WinIMEHandler.cpp and TSFTextStore.cpp, and would be relatively straightforward to do once we figure out how to go from the window/widget ref to "is this window in private browsing".

We should also use it for password fields in NON-private browsing (unless we're using IS\_PASSWORD and that does the same, although it's deprecated now).

3 years ago, although I investigated IS\_PRIVATE flag support for MS-IME, IME didn't see this flag and IME called `LCIEIsCurrentProcessInPrivate` to detect whether IE/Edge is private mode. If MS-IME supports IS\_PRIVATE, we should support it.

When I test Chrome Canary 80 with Windows 10 Build 1903, incognito mode on Chrome won't change to IME private mode. And this is same result even if using Insider build 18990.

When I talked with Yukawa-san when he came to Japan, he said, "Although I approved this patch, I didn't know whether MS-IME supported private mode by IS\_PRIVATE really."

Microsoft IME on Windows 10 20H1 (build 19025+) supports IME private mode by

input scope. Although previous Windows version uses undocumented API for

Edge and IE only, next Windows will use public API for it.

So let's use IS\_PRIVATE input scope in private browsing mode.

Sorry for the mingw failure. We had a similar one of these recently, you can follow that pattern to fix it.

File a bug like [Bug 1597739](/show_bug.cgi?id=1597739 "RESOLVED FIXED - mingw builds don't define ASSOCF_NONE (and presumably other API flags for AssocQueryString?)") blocking mingw-clang

Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |
