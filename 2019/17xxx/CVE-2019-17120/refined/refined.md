Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17120:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `adm_usrs.jsp` page in WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating new admin users. Specifically, the username field allows the inclusion of arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application database through the "username" field when creating a new admin user. This script is then executed when the admin user list is viewed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can be used to perform various malicious actions like:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user (e.g., creating new admin users, modifying configurations, etc.)

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through the `adm_usrs.jsp` page. The attacker needs to create a new admin user, inserting malicious HTML code in the username field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated as a user with the ability to create new admin users. This typically implies that the attacker is already an administrative user or has compromised a legitimate administrator's account.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided content specifies that this is a stored and reflected XSS vulnerability, this means that the malicious script is permanently saved by the application.
- The vulnerability affects WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server versions 4.2.0-b2047 and earlier.
- A patch (version 4.2.0.b2053) is available to fix the vulnerability.
- The attacker can cause the malicious code to trigger whenever the administrator management page is visited.
