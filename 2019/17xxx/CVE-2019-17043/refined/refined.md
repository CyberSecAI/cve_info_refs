The provided content relates to CVE-2019-17043.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SUID (set user ID) binary within the BMC Patrol Agent software, that allows privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- A SUID binary allows any local user to execute it with the privileges of the file's owner, in this case, the "patrol" user. This bypasses normal user access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unprivileged user can escalate their privileges to that of the "patrol" user.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is needed to execute the vulnerable SUID binary.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
