Here's the breakdown of the CVE-2019-17531 vulnerability, extracted from the provided content:

## CVE-2019-17531

- **Description:** Polymorphic Typing issue when enabling default typing for an externally exposed JSON endpoint and having apache-log4j-extra in the classpath leads to code execution. The `jackson-databind` package is vulnerable.
- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a polymorphic typing issue in the `jackson-databind` library. When default typing is enabled and the application includes the `apache-log4j-extra` library, it becomes possible for an attacker to inject a malicious payload via a specially crafted JSON endpoint. This is because `jackson-databind` may deserialize objects from unsafe sources, specifically related to `org.apache.log4j.receivers.db.*`.
- **Vulnerability:** Unsafe deserialization of objects due to enabling default typing, combined with the presence of `apache-log4j-extra` in the classpath.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a malicious JSON payload to an externally exposed endpoint.
- **Required Conditions:**
    1.  Accepts JSON content from an untrusted client.
    2.  Has `apache-log4j-extra` (version 1.2.x) in the classpath.
    3.  Enables polymorphic type handling for properties with a nominal type of `java.lang.Object`, `java.util.Serializable`, or `java.util.Comparable`, using:
        *   `enableDefaultTyping()`
        *   `@JsonTypeInfo using Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`

- **Affected Products (as per NetApp):**
    *   NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage
    *   OnCommand Workflow Automation
- **Mitigation:**
    *   Keep `jackson-databind` updated.
    *   Avoid enabling default typing.
    *   Avoid using `java.lang.Object` (or `java.util.Serializable`) as the nominal type of polymorphic values.
    *   Use "type name" instead of classname as type id.
