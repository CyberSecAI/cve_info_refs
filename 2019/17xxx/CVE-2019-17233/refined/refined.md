Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-17233

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `EWD_UFAQ_Import_From_Spreadsheet` function in the "Functions/EWD\_UFAQ\_Import.php" script lacks proper authorization checks (capability check and security nonce). This function is responsible for importing FAQ posts from a spreadsheet.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated File Upload:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication and authorization checks in the file upload functionality. An attacker can upload a malicious CSV file containing crafted HTML content without needing to be logged in or having any special privileges.
*  **Insecure File Handling:** The file upload process does not sanitize or validate the content of the uploaded file, allowing for arbitrary HTML injection, including links, formatted text and local or remote media files.
* **Lack of Input Validation:**  There is some filename sanitization, but not on the content within the file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML content into the WordPress site through the imported FAQ posts. This could lead to various issues, including:
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Phishing attempts

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated HTTP Request:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerable functionality by sending an unauthenticated POST request with a malicious CSV file to the `EWD_UFAQ_Import_From_Spreadsheet` function. No user authentication is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site, meaning no special access or privileges are required on the server/hosting environment.

**Additional Notes**
*   The blog post also mentions unauthenticated options *export* vulnerabilities in the `EWD_UFAQ_Export_To_Excel` and `EWD_UFAQ_Export_To_PDF` functions. These allow an attacker to export all FAQs, including password-protected ones, in CSV or PDF format. While this is considered low impact, it can lead to information disclosure.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.8.25 of the plugin, which was released on September 18, 2019.
