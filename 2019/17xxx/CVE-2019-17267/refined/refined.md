{
  "CVE-2019-17267": {
    "Description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate FasterXML jackson-databind. FasterXML jackson-databind versions through 2.9.10 are susceptible to vulnerabilities which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a Polymorphic Typing issue in FasterXML jackson-databind, specifically related to the use of the ehcache library. It permits deserialization of malicious objects when used in conjunction with polymorphic type handling methods such as `enableDefaultTyping()` or when `@JsonTypeInfo` is using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`, or other ways of instantiating objects from unsafe sources through ObjectMapper.readValue.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
       "Deserialization of Untrusted Data"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
     "Network"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious JSON payload to a vulnerable application that uses FasterXML jackson-databind library with the vulnerable configurations."
