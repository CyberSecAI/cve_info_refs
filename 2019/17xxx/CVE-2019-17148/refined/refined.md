Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-17148:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before it is used to execute a system call within the Parallels Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious commands into a system call. This occurs because the user-supplied string is not sanitized before being processed, which means it might include characters that have special meaning to the command interpreter, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to root level. This means the attacker gains complete control over the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By escalating to root, the attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges, potentially leading to further system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the guest system on which Parallels Desktop is running.
*   **Low-Privilege Code Execution:** The attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to run code with low privileges on the guest operating system of the Parallels virtual machine.
*   The attacker does not need user interaction to exploit the vulnerability once the initial foothold is established.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in Parallels Desktop version 15.1.1.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2019-07-22.
*   The coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2019-12-20.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Juno Im (@junorouse) from Theori.
