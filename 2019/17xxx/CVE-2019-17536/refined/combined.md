### @rastating **[rastating](/rastating)** commented [Oct 12, 2019](#issue-506248052)

It is possible to bypass the media asset upload restrictions that are in place to prevent arbitrary PHP being executed on the server by abusing a combination of two issues.

The first is the support for uploading animated GIFs. By submitting a GIF that contains the following content we can place a GIF file that contains [currently unexecutable] PHP code in a GIF file on the server (in this case `test.gif`):

```
GIF89a; <?=`$_GET[1]`?>

```

After uploading this, the file can now be clicked and the move function can be used to move this into another directory within the application directory with a PHP extension (in this case, it is moved to `tmp/media_thumb/shell.php`):

[![rename](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708742-743e1080-ed4d-11e9-8ae4-2f0ec6e09969.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708742-743e1080-ed4d-11e9-8ae4-2f0ec6e09969.png)

As can be seen in the below screenshot, this is now stored on the server with a valid extension:

[![shell-on-server](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708744-786a2e00-ed4d-11e9-9ee2-bcee843454bb.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708744-786a2e00-ed4d-11e9-9ee2-bcee843454bb.png)

At this point, the PHP file cannot be executed as the htaccess file found in `tmp/.htaccess` contains the following configuration:

```
<Files *.php>
deny from all
</Files>

```

This prevents any PHP files under `tmp/` being accessed. However, the same upload vulnerability can be abused to overwrite the htaccess file. To do this, one uploads a GIF file again but with the content:

```
# GIF89a;

```

This creates a GIF file on the server, that starts with a valid comment character, which prevents the server running into an error when parsing it during subsequent requests. The same rename bug can then be used to move this file to `tmp/.htaccess`:

[![htaccess](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708747-7d2ee200-ed4d-11e9-9755-fa145e819dfb.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708747-7d2ee200-ed4d-11e9-9755-fa145e819dfb.png)

After doing this, the PHP file can be accessed from the web browser, and remote code execution is gained as can be seen in the below screenshot in which `cat /etc/passwd` is executed:

[![shell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708749-80c26900-ed4d-11e9-90db-c0aa2d86b0cb.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2500434/66708749-80c26900-ed4d-11e9-90db-c0aa2d86b0cb.png)

This pull request implements a rather simplistic means of patching this for now, by checking the extension of the specified destination path and blocking it if it is either `php` or `htaccess`. Ideally, a more robust solution should be put in place in the long term by creating a valid white list of safe extensions, but for now, this should mitigate the immediate threat.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| You're welcome! It should be noted that there is still potential for abuse by using a blacklist vs a white list of safe extensions.  Although I believe the default configuration of Apache / PHP adds handlers for extensions such as `php4` and `php5`, these may still be present in some users' configurations. So, ideally, it'll be locked down to only allowed specific extensions rather than allowing everything except `.php` and `.htaccess`  It's more of an edge case scenario nowadays, but it's worth trying to fix it at some point in the future when time permits 😃 |

# Gila CMS Upload Filter Bypass and RCE

October 13, 2019

Versions prior to and including 1.11.4 of Gila CMS are vulnerable to remote code execution by users that are permitted to upload media files. It is possible to bypass the media asset upload restrictions that are in place to prevent arbitrary PHP being executed on the server by abusing a combination of two issues.

The first is the support for uploading animated GIFs. By submitting a GIF that contains the following content we can place a GIF file that contains [currently unexecutable] PHP code in a GIF file on the server (in this case `test.gif`):

```
GIF89a; <?=`$_GET[1]`?>

```

After uploading this, the file can now be clicked and the move function can be used to move this into another directory within the application directory with a PHP extension (in this case, it is moved to `tmp/media_thumb/shell.php`):

![](/assets/images/2019-10-13-gila-cms-upload-bypass-and-rce/rename.png)

As can be seen in the below screenshot, this is now stored on the server with a valid extension:

![](/assets/images/2019-10-13-gila-cms-upload-bypass-and-rce/shell-on-server.png)

At this point, the PHP file cannot be executed as the htaccess file found in `tmp/.htaccess` contains the following configuration:

```
<Files *.php>
deny from all
</Files>

```

This prevents any PHP files under `tmp/` being accessed. However, the same upload vulnerability can be abused to overwrite the htaccess file. To do this, one uploads a GIF file again but with the content:

```
# GIF89a;

```

This creates a GIF file on the server, that starts with a valid comment character, which prevents the server running into an error when parsing it during subsequent requests. The same rename bug can then be used to move this file to `tmp/.htaccess`:
