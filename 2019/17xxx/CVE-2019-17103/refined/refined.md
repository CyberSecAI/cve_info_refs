- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Incorrect default permissions in the `BDLDaemon` component of Bitdefender Antivirus for Mac.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is due to an "Incorrect Default Permissions" issue. Specifically, it seems that the `BDLDaemon` component has overly permissive access controls, which allows an attacker to perform actions they should not normally be able to.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can elevate permissions to read protected directories. This may lead to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: The CVSS vector string `AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N` indicates:
    - **AV:P (Physical)**: The attack requires physical access to the system.
    - **AC:L (Low)**: The attack complexity is low.
    - **PR:L (Low)**: The attacker needs low privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
    - **UI:R (Required)**: User interaction is required.
    - **S:C (Changed)**: The vulnerability affects a different security scope than the vulnerable component itself.
    - **C:H (High)**: High impact on Confidentiality.
    - **I:N (None)**: No impact on Integrity.
    - **A:N (None)**: No impact on Availability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the machine, must have low privileges on the system, and a user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
