The provided content is related to CVE-2019-17532.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way the Wemo Switch 28B handles rules updates. Specifically, the device stores rules in an internal database, which is sent by the app (in a compressed format), every time a rule is added or removed. The device does not require any authentication for this process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication: The device accepts rule updates without verifying the source.
- Inadequate input validation: The device accepts malicious or corrupted databases.
- Insecure database handling: The device's database can be corrupted through crafted rule updates

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The attacker can send a crafted database that corrupts the device's internal rule database.
- Loss of functionality: Corrupting the database prevents the user from setting or removing rules through the app.
- Device reset required: The user has to hard reset the device, causing a loss of stored information to restore its functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network: The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/upnp/control/rules1` endpoint of the Wemo Switch.
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device because there is no authentication required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access: The attacker must be on the same network as the target Wemo Switch.
- Ability to craft HTTP requests: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted SOAP message in an HTTP POST request.
