- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the installation script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially allowing them to steal cookies, redirect the user to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation can be achieved by sending crafted HTTP requests to the `/HongCMS-master/install/index.php` with malicious payloads embedded in the `servername`, `dbname`, `dbusername`, `dbpassword`, and `tableprefix` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
