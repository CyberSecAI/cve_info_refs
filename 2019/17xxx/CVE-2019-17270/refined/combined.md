# Exploit Title: Yachtcontrol Webapplication 1.0 - Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution
# Google Dork: N/A
# Date: 2019-12-06
# Exploit Author: Hodorsec
# Vendor Homepage: http://www.yachtcontrol.nl/en/
# Version: 1.0
# Software Link: http://download.yachtcontrol.nl/klant/Software/ & http://download.yachtcontrol.nl/klant/Firmware/
# Versions: Yachtcontrol webapplication through versions dated on 2019-10-06. No versioning system detected.
# Tested on: Yachtcontrol webservers disclosed via Dutch GPRS/4G mobile IP-ranges. IP addresses vary due to DHCP client leasing of telco's.
# CVE: N/A
#
# Description Product:
# Yachtcontrol software is being used for controlling several aspects on yachts, as the name implies. Having access to the webapplication,
# it's possible to control several items such as lights, powergenerator, solarcontrol, airco, wipers, heating and other components.
# Websoftware is built in PHP and mostly runs on a Linux based firmware device, controlling several other components related to the Yacht.
# Other related software running on the same firmware device are custom compiled ELF binaries for controlling related onboard devices.
#
# Description Vulnerability:
# It's possible to perform direct Operating System commands as an unauthenticated user via the "/pages/systemcall.php?command={COMMAND}"
# page and parameter, where {COMMAND} will be executed and returning the results to the client.
#
# Affected Components:
# Yachtcontrol webservers using the custom PHP webapplication, versions until 2019-10-06.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.
