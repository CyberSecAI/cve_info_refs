  "CVE-2019-17185": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The EAP-pwd module in FreeRADIUS 3.0.x before 3.0.20 used a global OpenSSL BN_CTX instance, leading to crashes due to multithreaded access during concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes, which can be exploited for Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The EAP-pwd module used a single, global OpenSSL BN_CTX instance for all handshakes, causing a race condition when multiple threads accessed it simultaneously.",
       "vulnerabilities": [
        "Concurrency issue due to shared resource access across multiple threads.",
        "Missing thread safety in the EAP-pwd module.",
        "Global use of a single BN_CTX instance."
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can cause the FreeRADIUS server to crash by initiating concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks.",
        "Exploiting concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes.",
        "Sending multiple EAP-pwd requests from different clients."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate multiple concurrent EAP-pwd handshakes from different clients to trigger the vulnerability. No specific privileges are required on the target system. An adjacent network position would be sufficient."
