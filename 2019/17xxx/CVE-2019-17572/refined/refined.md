The provided content relates to CVE-2019-17572.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the automatic topic creation feature in Apache RocketMQ brokers, which, when enabled, allows an attacker to create a topic folder in the parent directory using a crafted topic name containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., "../").

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability.
- Inadequate validation of topic names, allowing directory traversal sequences.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to write files or create directories in arbitrary locations of the broker's file system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious topic name from the rocketmq-client to the broker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send messages to the RocketMQ broker.
- The broker must have the automatic topic creation feature enabled (which is enabled by default).

**Affected versions:**
- Apache RocketMQ 4.2.0 to 4.6.0

**Fixed version:**
- Apache RocketMQ 4.6.1 and later
