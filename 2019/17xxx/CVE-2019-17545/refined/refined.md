  "CVE-2019-17545": {
    "description": "GDAL through 3.0.1 has a poolDestroy double free in OGRExpatRealloc in ogr/ogr_expat.cpp when the 10MB threshold was exceeded.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a double free in the OGRExpatRealloc function within the ogr/ogr_expat.cpp file. This occurs when the size of memory being requested to allocate exceeds the defined 10MB threshold.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Double free vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service via application crash or possibly the execution of arbitrary code if maliciously crafted data was parsed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Parsing maliciously crafted geospatial data"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted input file that, when processed by GDAL, triggers the vulnerability. The input needs to cause a memory allocation greater than 10MB"
