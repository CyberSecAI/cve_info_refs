# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Even 15.0 will be out of maintenance soon.  Now the situation is the following we have already 3.0.1 in the devel repository. But main oss repo was not updated (I don't know why).  So one of the solution would be to update it with the update-oss channel, but I'm not sure it is the desire way.  I'm adding my fellow maintainer Martn to get its opinion. Btw I'm traveling in France this week, so can't do that much. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1153918#c2)  Bruno Friedmann   2019-11-04 12:40:10 UTC  ``` Now 2.4.3 is released we can open update process more easily for 15.0 and 15.1 <https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/Release/2.4.3-News>  Who want to make it ? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1153918#c3)  Bruno Friedmann   2019-11-04 18:03:20 UTC  ``` Maintenance request created  <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/745248>  need to be accepted ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1153918#c4)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-11-09 20:11:33 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2019:2466-1: An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
