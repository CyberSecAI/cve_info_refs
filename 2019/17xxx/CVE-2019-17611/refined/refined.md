- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing parameters on the install page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application that can be executed within the context of other users' browsers. This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerabilities are located in the `/HongCMS-master/install/index.php` file, specifically the `servername`, `dbname`, `dbusername`, `dbpassword`, and `tableprefix` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker can remotely exploit the XSS vulnerabilities by injecting malicious script within the specified parameters.
