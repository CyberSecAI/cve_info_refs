The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Pbootcms.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization in the Pbootcms admin panel. Specifically, when modifying a 'single page' through `/Pboot/admin.php?p=/Single/index/mcode/1`, the content entered is not properly sanitized before being stored. This unsanitized input is then rendered on the front-end of the site.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious JavaScript code is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is viewed.
- Insufficient input sanitization: The application does not properly sanitize the user-supplied input before storing it in the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser: An attacker can execute malicious scripts within the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions, such as:
   - Cookie theft
   - Session hijacking
   - Defacement of the website
   - Redirection to malicious websites
   - Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to access the Pbootcms admin panel
- The attacker must then navigate to the 'single page' modification page (`/Pboot/admin.php?p=/Single/index/mcode/1`)
- The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a page content field
- This malicious code is then stored and executed when a user visits the affected page on the front-end such as `/Pboot/?contact/`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires access to the administrative interface of Pbootcms.
- They must have sufficient privileges to modify the content of single pages.
