## Version information

* Laravel: v5.8.30
* Voyager: v1.2.6

## Description

During pentesting some projects, i found critical vulnerability in Voyager Compass. This vulnerability can give to anyone, who has permission to use compass, power of download and delete every file in the system if the user has permission for this operation in the system. This means, bad guy can steal .env file of your application and sign his own new session and cookie with secret application key or just drop your database knowing username and password of the database.

## How can you reproduce it?

[[Redacted]]
