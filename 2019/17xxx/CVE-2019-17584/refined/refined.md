Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17584:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Meinberg SyncBox/PTP/PTPv2 devices were shipped with default, hardcoded SSH keys. This included a default RSA private key which allowed anyone in possession of it to log into the device as root via SSH. Additionally, default host keys made man-in-the-middle attacks easier.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Hardcoded SSH private key:** The devices contained a default private RSA key that was used as an authorized key for root login without a password.
*   **Static SSH host keys:** Default host keys were present, making man-in-the-middle attacks easier as the keys were not unique to each device.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Full root access:** An attacker with the private key can gain complete control of the affected devices by logging in as the root user.
*  **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** Default SSH host keys make it easier for attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks against SSH sessions, intercepting communications and potentially modifying data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the device to use SSH. The private key can be used from any system with network access to the target device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to possess the default private RSA key, which was publicly available.
*   The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable device via SSH.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all Meinberg SyncBox/PTP/PTPv2 devices with firmware versions up to v5.34o, v5.34s, v5.32\*, or 5.34g.
*   The private key was also found in a firmware update for another Meinberg device, meaning the attack vector wasn't limited to the SyncBox devices.
*   The vendor provided a firmware update to remove the default SSH keys and regenerate them.
*   The vendor also provided instructions to manually remove the default keys and regenerate host keys if firmware update wasn't feasible. The locations of these keys varied and are listed in the advisory.
*   The advisory provides multiple fingerprints/hashes of the vulnerable keys.
