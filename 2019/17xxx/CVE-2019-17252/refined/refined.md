Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-17252:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `FORMATS.dll` plugin of IrfanView. Specifically, the issue lies within the `Read_BadPNG` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- User Mode Write Access Violation: The vulnerability is triggered by a write operation to an invalid memory location.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability allows for a user mode write access violation.
- This could lead to application crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution by overwriting data within the application's memory.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker must trick a user into opening a specially crafted PNG file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious PNG file.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the file with the vulnerable version of IrfanView.
- No special user privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The specific instruction causing the crash is at `FORMATS!Read_BadPNG+0x115`
- The instruction is `mov dword ptr [esi+20h],0`.
- This instruction attempts to write a DWORD (4 bytes) value of 0 to a memory location at the address `esi + 0x20`.
- The memory location at `ds:002b:0e314000` is invalid, which leads to the user mode write access violation.
