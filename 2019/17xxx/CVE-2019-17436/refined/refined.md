Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-17436

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper privilege management within the GlobalProtect App for Linux and macOS. This allows non-root users to overwrite files owned by the root user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Privilege Management:** The application doesn't correctly manage user privileges, allowing a low-privileged user to perform actions that should be restricted to the root user.
- **File Overwrite:** The specific vulnerability is that a non-root user can overwrite root-owned files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation allows a local, low-privileged user to gain elevated privileges on the system.
- **Integrity and Availability Impact:**  The attacker can modify system files (integrity impact) and potentially cause system malfunctions (availability impact).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can only be exploited by a user with local access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privileged User:** The attacker needs to have a local user account with low privileges on the target system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have direct access to the system, either physically or via remote access (e.g., SSH).

**Affected Versions:**
- GlobalProtect App 5.0.4 and earlier for Linux and macOS.
- GlobalProtect App 4.1.12 and earlier for Linux and macOS.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to GlobalProtect App 5.0.5 or later for Linux and macOS.
- Upgrade to GlobalProtect App 4.1.13 or later for Linux and macOS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "HIGH" severity with a CVSS base score of 7.1.
- The vulnerability was discovered externally and reported by Hanno Heinrichs of CrowdStrike Intelligence.
- The weakness type is categorized as CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).
