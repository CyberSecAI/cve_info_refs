# WordPress 5.2.4 Security Release

---

[WordPress 5.2.4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2.4.zip) is now available! This security release fixes 6 security issues.

WordPress versions 5.2.3 and earlier are affected by these bugs, which are fixed in version 5.2.4. Updated versions of WordPress 5.1 and earlier are also available for any users who have not yet updated to 5.2.

### Security Updates

* Props to [Evan Ricafort](https://evanricafort.com/) for finding an issue where stored XSS (cross-site scripting) could be added via the Customizer.
* Props to [J.D. Grimes](https://codesymphony.co/) who found and disclosed a method of viewing unauthenticated posts.
* Props to [Weston Ruter](https://weston.ruter.net/) for finding a way to create a stored XSS to inject Javascript into style tags.
* Props to David Newman for highlighting a method to poison the cache of JSON GET requests via the Vary: Origin header.
* Props to [Eugene Kolodenker](http://eugenekolo.com/) who found a server-side request forgery in the way that URLs are validated.
* Props to Ben Bidner of the WordPress Security Team who discovered issues related to referrer validation in the admin.

Thank you to all of the reporters for [privately disclosing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/) the vulnerabilities, which gave us time to fix them before WordPress sites could be attacked.

For more info, browse the full list of changes on Trac or check out the Version [5.2.4 documentation page](https://wordpress.org/support/wordpress-version/version-5-2-4/).

WordPress 5.2.4 is a short-cycle security release. The next major release will be [version 5.3](https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-3/).

You can [download WordPress 5.2.4](https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2.4.zip) or visit `Dashboard → Updates` and click `Update Now`. Sites that support automatic background updates have already started to update automatically.

In addition to the security researchers mentioned above, thank you to everyone who contributed to WordPress 5.2.4:

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3141-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : wordpress
Version        : 5.0.17+dfsg1-0+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-17670
Debian Bug     : 942459

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a popular
content management framework. Server Side Request Forgery and cross-site
scripting (XSS) attacks may facilitate the bypass of access controls or the
injection of client-side scripts.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
5.0.17+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : wordpress
Version        : 4.7.18+dfsg-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-17670 CVE-2020-4047 CVE-2020-4048 CVE-2020-4049
                 CVE-2020-4050
Debian Bug     : 942459 962685

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a popular
content management framework.

CVE-2019-17670

    WordPress has a Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
    because Windows paths are mishandled during certain validation of
    relative URLs.

CVE-2020-4047

    Authenticated users with upload permissions (like authors) are
    able to inject JavaScript into some media file attachment pages in
    a certain way. This can lead to script execution in the context of
    a higher privileged user when the file is viewed by them.

CVE-2020-4048

    Due to an issue in wp_validate_redirect() and URL sanitization, an
    arbitrary external link can be crafted leading to unintended/open
    redirect when clicked.

CVE-2020-4049

    When uploading themes, the name of the theme folder can be crafted
    in a way that could lead to JavaScript execution in /wp-admin on
    the themes page.

CVE-2020-4050

    Misuse of the `set-screen-option` filter's return value allows
    arbitrary user meta fields to be saved. It does require an admin
    to install a plugin that would misuse the filter. Once installed,
    it can be leveraged by low privileged users.

Additionally, this upload ensures latest comments can only be viewed
from public posts, and fixes back the user activation procedure.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.7.18+dfsg-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

its security tracker page at:

Package        : wordpress
Version        : 4.1.28+dfsg-0+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-17669 CVE-2019-17670 CVE-2019-17671
                 CVE-2019-17675
Debian Bug     : 942459

Several vulnerabilities in wordpress, a web blogging tool, have been
fixed.

CVE-2019-17669

    Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability because URL
    validation does not consider the interpretation of a name as a
    series of hex characters.

CVE-2019-17670

   Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability was reported in
   wp_validate_redirect(). Normalize the path when validating the
   location for relative URLs.

CVE-2019-17671

   Unauthenticated viewing of certain content (private or draft posts)
   is possible because the static query property is mishandled.

CVE-2019-17675

    Wordpress does not properly consider type confusion during
    validation of the referer in the admin pages. This vulnerability
    affects the check_admin_referer() WordPress function.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.1.28+dfsg-0+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.
