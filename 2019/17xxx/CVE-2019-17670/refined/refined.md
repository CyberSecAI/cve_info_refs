Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-17670:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from how `wp_validate_redirect()` handles relative URLs, specifically on Windows systems. The function did not properly normalize the path component of the URL, leading to potential issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core issue is that the lack of proper path normalization in `wp_validate_redirect()` allows an attacker to potentially craft a malicious relative URL that could be interpreted differently by the server than intended.
- **Path Mishandling:** Windows paths and Unix paths can have different directory separators. The function did not account for these differences, which could result in an incorrect path being constructed, leading to SSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **SSRF:** An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to perform server-side request forgery attacks. This could allow them to make requests to internal services or external resources, bypassing security controls and potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Unintended Redirect:** The vulnerability, before being patched, could lead to the construction of URLs that result in an unexpected redirect.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Relative URLs:** The primary attack vector involves crafting relative URLs that are specifically designed to exploit the path normalization vulnerability. This can be done by manipulating the path component of the URL to bypass intended access controls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to influence the URL parameter that is being validated by `wp_validate_redirect()`.

**Technical Details:**

- **Code Change:** The fix involves adding a call to `wp_normalize_path()` before validating the relative URL. This function ensures that the path is properly normalized before being used to construct the final URL.
```php
if ( ! empty( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ) {
    $path = dirname( parse_url( 'http://placeholder' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH ) . '?' );
    $path = wp_normalize_path( $path ); // Added for normalization.
}
$location = '/' . ltrim( $path . '/', '/' ) . $location;

```

- **Vulnerable Code:** The original code did not normalize the path component of the URL, leading to the vulnerability.
```php
if ( ! empty( $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] ) ) {
    $path = dirname( parse_url( 'http://placeholder' . $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], PHP_URL_PATH ) . '?' );
}
$location = '/' . ltrim( $path . '/', '/' ) . $location;
```
- **Affected Versions:** WordPress versions prior to 5.2.4, 5.1 and earlier are affected.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability was addressed in WordPress version 5.2.4.
- The fix also includes the addition of unit tests to ensure that the vulnerability is properly addressed and will not be reintroduced.
- Debian LTS also released security updates for affected versions.
