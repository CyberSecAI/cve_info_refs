{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A state machine bug in the Signal app's call handling logic.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The Signal app incorrectly handles the 'connect' message, allowing a malicious actor to force a call to be connected on the callee's device even before the user accepts it.",
      "The application uses a naive switch statement logic instead of a proper state machine."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can force an incoming call to be answered on a victim's device, enabling them to listen to audio from the victim's microphone without the user's explicit interaction or knowledge.",
    "attack_vectors": "A modified Signal client is used to send a 'connect' message to the callee device during an incoming call, causing the call to be answered without user interaction.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to use a modified Signal client."
