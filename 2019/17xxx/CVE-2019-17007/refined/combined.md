[crash testcase](attachment.cgi?id=9049058)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9049058&action=edit)

I noticed that the main entrypoint for decoding DER blobs in NSS, `CERT_DecodeCertPackage()`, actually handles multiple formats including PEM, PKCS7, and old Netscape Certificate Sequences.

You can generate a Netscape Certificate Sequence with the OpenSSL `nseq` tool, I just did this:

```
$ openssl nseq -in mail.google.com.pem -toseq -out nseq.pem

```

I guessed that this format might not have been as well audited as others, so fuzzed it and it crashed with a NULL deref quickly.

Test case attached, I'm guessing this means any client or server that handles untrusted certificates can be crashed, I didn't try it against Firefox.

You can verify it like this:

```
$ certutil -d "." -A -n test -t "p,p,p" -i nss-nseq-crash.der
Segmentation fault

```

I suppose this is a trivial denial of service issue against the network daemons that use NSS.

The obvious question has to be asked: do we still need to support these? I'll ask on nss-dev.

SEC\_ReadCertSequence (via CERT\_DecodeCertPackage) takes a callback (in this case, collect\_certs) that it calls with a pointer to an array of pointers to SECItems corresponding to any encoded certificates it found. It looks like it's possible to get it to allocate this array but not fill it out (e.g. if the data consists of an empty SEQUENCE) (I'm seeing an array with a single null pointer, but maybe that's just luck). In any case, SEC\_ReadCertSequence calls the callback with this empty array and a count of 0, which collect\_certs ignores and attempts to copy the SECItem it thinks is present, resulting in a null deref. Seems like collect\_certs should at least check its given count and return an error, although I imagine there might be more bugs in these functions.

Are we planning to assign a CVE to this? Assuming this a a null pointer deref, where a client can present a malicious cert to a server and crash it or the other way around.

If you'd like one assigned for tracking purposes, we certainly can, and update the relnotes retroactively: Just needinfo `tom@mozilla.com`

When this bug was last updated.Classification
Bugs are categorised into Classifications, Products and Components. classifications is the top-level categorization.Comment
Bugs have comments added to them by Bugzilla users. You can search for some text in those comments.Comment Tag
Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform

See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM products provide a level of robustness and reliability that have set the standard for
communications networks deployed in harsh environments. Designed to meet and exceed IEC 61850-3
protocol requirements, the RUGGEDCOM Layer 3 Multi-Service Platform family of switches and routers
offers integrated router, ﬁrewall and VPN functionalities. The RUGGEDCOM RX1400 is a multi-protocol
intelligent node which combines Ethernet switching, routing and application hosting capabilities with
various wide area connectivity options.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
