Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-17521:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the password change functionality of the Landing-CMS application.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The application does not implement any mechanism to prevent CSRF attacks.
- Specifically, the password change endpoint (`http://192.168.18.130/cms/password/`) is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can change the admin's password without their knowledge or consent.
- This can lead to complete control of the application by the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed through a malicious HTML file.
- When the admin user clicks on the crafted HTML file, it submits a password change request to the vulnerable endpoint in the background.
- This request is made with the admin's session cookies, therefore, the server assumes it's a legitimate request from the admin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to host a malicious HTML file or inject this HTML into a website that the admin user might visit.
- The attacker does not need to have direct access to the application's server, or be logged in to the application.
- The attacker relies on the admin user being logged into the application in their browser and unknowingly visiting the malicious HTML.

**Additional details:**
- The provided HTML payload demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability:
    - It contains a form with hidden fields for the new passwords (`pwd1` and `pwd2`).
    - The form's `action` attribute points to the vulnerable password change URL.
    - The form is automatically submitted when the page loads (potentially with some user interaction, like clicking submit).
- The included image is a screenshot of the successful password change.

This analysis suggests that the provided information is related to a CSRF vulnerability, which is consistent with the description of CVE-2019-17521, although a CVE description is not provided in the content.
