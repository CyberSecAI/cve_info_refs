This is really an amazing small animation plugin which literally made my all custom css ads templates in the website. Now wherever I need, I can use them. I have one suggestion, if you could please add an option to link it to any URL. Then this will be really great. Thank you

I searched througout options and documentation but I couldn’t find any guide or example of use with Gutenberg. There’s only a video that shows it but using the classic editor

This plugin doesn’t make it clear which of the features it advertises are basic level and which are part of the Pro version, so I uninstalled.
The plugin is no longer listed on the Plugins page, but the Settings page still appears under WordPress Settings.
