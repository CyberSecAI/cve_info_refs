As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of  openSUSE (At this moment openSUSE Leap 15.1, 15.0 and Tumbleweed) please feel free to reopen this bug against that version (!you must update the "Version" component in the bug fields, do not just reopen please), or alternatively create a new ticket.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.
