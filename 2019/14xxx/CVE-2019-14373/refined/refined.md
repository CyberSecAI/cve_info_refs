Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-14373:

**1. Verification of CVE relation:**

The provided content relates to a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability found within the libpng library, which is triggered while processing a specially crafted FLIF file.  The crash occurs in the `png_set_text_2` function, which is indeed a function within the libpng library, suggesting this is very likely related to CVE-2019-14373, which is reported to be in `png_set_text`.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-buffer-overflow in libpng's `png_set_text_2` function. This is triggered when processing a specially crafted FLIF file that contains malicious metadata that is passed to the libpng library when saving the decoded image to PNG format.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The vulnerability is a classic heap-based buffer overflow. This means that a crafted input file causes the `png_set_text_2` function to write past the allocated buffer boundary on the heap.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Crash:** The immediate impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a crash of the application processing the malicious FLIF file. As seen from the provided ASAN logs.
-   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** While the provided content only shows a crash, heap-buffer-overflows can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker carefully crafts the overflowing data. This could allow an attacker to take full control of the affected system.

**5. Attack vectors:**

-   **Malicious FLIF file:** The primary attack vector is a specially crafted FLIF file containing malicious text metadata that exploits the vulnerability when converting it to PNG.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   **Ability to provide input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious FLIF file to an application or system that uses the vulnerable libpng library via the FLIF library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered in the `png_set_text_2` function, which is part of the libpng library.
*   The provided AddressSanitizer (ASAN) output clearly indicates a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   The crafted FLIF file causes a crash during the image save (to PNG) phase.
*   The ASAN output provides call stack information which pinpoints the vulnerable function.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `png_set_text_2`.
*   **Root Cause:** Crafted FLIF file causing libpng to write past allocated heap buffer.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious FLIF file.
*   **Attacker Capability:** Ability to supply a malicious FLIF file to vulnerable application using FLIF and libpng for PNG output.
