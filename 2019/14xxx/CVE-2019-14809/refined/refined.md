Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14809:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the `net/url` package of the Go programming language, specifically in how it parses and handles malformed hosts within URLs. The package incorrectly interprets certain invalid characters and sequences within the host part of the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Malformed Host Handling:** The `net/url` package fails to reject or correctly parse URLs with malformed hosts. Specifically, it mishandles cases where a suffix appears in the Host field but is neither a valid hostname nor a valid port. It also mishandles invalid characters and sequences in the hostname.
-   **Authorization Bypass:** This leads to an authorization bypass because an attacker can craft a malicious URL which is parsed and interpreted differently by the vulnerable system and the server it is connecting to. This allows for a man-in-the-middle attack or can enable the attacker to impersonate trusted sources. 
-   **Inconsistent Hostname Extraction:**  The `Hostname()` method on parsed URLs can extract hostnames different than expected when given a crafted input, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities within systems relying on this method.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker can bypass authorization checks within applications that rely on the `net/url` package for parsing and validating URLs. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
-   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** The vulnerability is in a fundamental package for handling URLs. Hence any software using Go to process URLs is at risk, which could be abused through various attack vectors including remote code execution by exploiting this inconsistent parsing behavior to inject malicious code or trick applications.
-   **Security bypass:** The inconsistent interpretation of URLs can lead to security bypass issues depending on how the application uses the URL.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Crafted URLs:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs with specifically malformed hosts, using character sequences like `%250a` along with invalid port numbers or IPv6 syntax to manipulate the output of `URL.Parse`, allowing arbitrary host names to be returned. For example javascript URLs can be used to inject malicious scripts.
-   **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** If an application uses the `net/url` package to process URLs in a security context, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to change the target of requests or to impersonate a legitimate server.
-   **Web Applications:** Malformed URLs can be embedded into web applications in order to trick their security systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Ability to supply malformed URLs:** The attacker must be able to provide a crafted URL to a vulnerable application, either by directly inputting it into the application or by causing the application to retrieve it from a malicious source. This is typically possible via a web interface or through other vectors that allow URL input.
-   **No special access privileges required:** The attacker does not need special access privileges to exploit this vulnerability, as the issue lies within how the `net/url` package itself handles these specially crafted strings.

**Additional Technical Details (from the content):**
-   The issue stems from a mishandling of URLs where the Host field contains a suffix that doesn't appear in `Hostname()` or `Port()` methods.
-   The vulnerability affects Go versions before 1.11.13 and 1.12.x before 1.12.8.
-   URLs like `javascript://alert(1)` and `http://[google.com]:80` are examples of the type of malformed input that triggers the vulnerability.

The provided documents also show that multiple vendors (including Debian, Fedora, SUSE, and Red Hat) have released security updates to address this vulnerability in their respective distributions.
