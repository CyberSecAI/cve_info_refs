Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `moveItem` method of the `GCDWebUploader` class within the GCDWebServer library. The method only checks the file extension of the *new* absolute path (`newAbsolutePath`) after a file is moved, but it fails to check the extension of the *old* absolute path (`oldAbsolutePath`) before the move operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper validation of the source file's extension during the move operation. This allows an attacker to potentially move files with extensions that should be restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access/Exposure:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially make previously inaccessible files accessible. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information, including application credentials or other critical data.
- **File System Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows for the unauthorized movement of files, which could disrupt the intended file system structure and functionality of an application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Move Request:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious `moveItem` request with a source file that has a restricted extension and a destination with an allowed extension.
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface provided by GCDWebServer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the GCDWebServer instance.
- **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs to be familiar with the `moveItem` API of `GCDWebUploader`.
- **Ability to Send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the GCDWebServer.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was reported in GitHub issue #433.
- The fix was implemented in commit `02738433bf2e1b820ef48f04edd15df304081802`, which also addresses a similar issue in `GCDWebDAVServer`
- The fix involved adding checks for both the old and new file paths in both `GCDWebUploader` and `GCDWebDAVServer` before a move or copy operation.
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.5.3 of GCDWebServer.
