# Breaking (Bad) Cross-Site Request Forgery Protection – The Netgear Nighthawk M1

G Richter
10 Aug 2019

### What is CSRF?

Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a descriptive term, but pretty oblique if you don’t know exactly what it means. Broken down, it’s pretty simple:

* A malicious web page running in your browser can send requests to other sites.
* When it sends those requests, it’ll use the current session cookie stored in your browser.
* So if you’re logged into something (or even if you’re not), the malicious page can send requests from your browser context, with the privileges of your current session on that site.

Basically, the malicious web page can try to “forge” “requests” from its own site to another (“cross-site”). So it’s “Cross-Site Request Forgery”. Simple!

If you’re running a web application, and you haven’t implemented some kind of CSRF protection, then you’re not checking whether requests originated from pages you control. Baddies might rely on this to make requests to a site with the current session permissions of a logged-in user. They might try to change that user’s password, for instance, and steal their account.

However, a malicious page can’t usually **read data back** from another site. There’s a policy in all browsers called the *Same Origin Policy*. By default, if one page asks to read the contents of another site, the answer is a resounding **NO**.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2017/08/CSRKM1-1.png)

There are exceptions to this, but they can be discussed in depth another time. Regardless, the SOP stops one page from reading the contents of another.

So, usually, a CSRF-protection mechanism looks like this:

* A token is issued by a website.
* The token is checked when a request is parsed, and rejected if the token’s wrong.

The assumption is that since a malicious site can’t read back responses from another site, it can’t know the token, so it can’t send valid requests.

### There are (obvious?) exceptions

Let’s say you want to embed an image off another server. Unless the server application implements an extremely heavy cross-origin protection logic, or some other kind of authentication, then you’ll probably be allowed to do this. This would fall into the category of cross-origin *embedding*.

[Mozilla have a handy breakdown](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#Cross-origin_network_access) of what’s allowed to be embedded:

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2017/08/moz-richter.png)

Cross-origin embedding is fine. You can embed scripts, images, CSS, media, fonts – all kinds of web trash.

### What does this mean for routers?

CSRF is particularly interesting in the case of devices running on your LAN which might have web interfaces exposed – e.g. routers. While your router web interface might not be directly accessible over the “Internet”, it is accessible from your browser. And, as we know, since malicious websites can try to make requests anywhere, they can even try to make requests to your router.

So, it makes sense that routers would include CSRF protection mechanisms. That’s exactly what the Netgear Nighthawk M1 has.

### Netgear Nighthawk M1 CSRF Protection

The Netgear Nighthawk M1 web interface has a CSRF protection token mechanism. All requests to the API endpoints have to have a token parameter, and look a bit like this:

```
POST /Forms/config HTTP/1.1

Host: 192.168.1.1

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0

Accept: */*

Accept-Language: en-GB,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Referer: http://192.168.1.1/index.html

Content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 113

Cookie: sessionId=0000000d-bW1XS27NZzc39egmHaPFXRP9vuZl3wp

Connection: close

general.shutdown=restart&err_redirect=/error.json&ok_redirect=/success.json&token=k8BKKSfEUxxMlrrFaCyQgGuTMGRSbnl
```

This token is retrieved under normal circumstances by reading the contents of a file at /api/model.json, which is a dynamically-generated file containing a JSON object of various configuration and session values, including the session.secToken.

```
[...snip...]

"session": {

"userRole": "Guest",

"lang": "en",

"hintDisplayPassword": "",

"secToken": "oEO6wjnuQWBQJmtAcrVCj8forV1MtnW",

"clientIP": "192.168.1.44",

"supportedLangList": [

{

"id": "en",

"isCurrent": true,

"label": "English"

},

[...snip...]
```

Now, we can’t simply embed this JSON object in JavaScript on a 3rd party page and read it back. Pure JSON’s not allowed. If it were JSONP, that would be different. JSONP wraps a JSON object in a function call, so you can embed it and access it like a normal script. Browsers allow that.

### You know what browsers also allow? Plain old JavaScript

Turns out the file at /js/NetgearStrings.js is also dynamically-generated. And contains this nice netgearLoadData variable at the top.

![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/plugins/lazy-load/images/1x1.trans.gif)![](https://www.pentestpartners.com/content/uploads/2017/08/CSRKM1-2.png)

Which happens to contain the session.secToken value as well.

### Conclusion

It’s not big, it’s not clever. But it’s definitely the easiest CSRF bypass I’ve seen. A bit like leaving the key under the mat. Or, just totally misunderstanding the reasoning for having a key for the house, and not locking the door.

I’m also not entirely sure how TODO code gets left on production devices by major US manufacturers. grep is a very easy tool to use.

This issue has been assigned CVE-2019-14526. A post-authentication command injection issue we found has also been assigned CVE-2019-14527.

![4G Router Vulnerabilities Let Attackers Take Full Control](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2019/08/12/Cell_Tower.jpg)

Multiple vulnerabilities were found by security researchers in 4G routers manufactured by several companies, with the flaws exposing users to information leaks and command execution attacks.

Pen Test Partners researcher 'G Richter' [shared the flaws](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-27/dc-27-speakers.html#g%20richter) found in 4G devices during this year's DEF CON hacking conference, saying that "a lot of existing 4G modems and routers are pretty insecure."

"We found critical remotely-exploitable flaws in a selection of devices from variety of vendors, without having to do too much work," Richter said.

"Plus, there’s only a small pool of OEMs working seriously with cellular technologies, and their hardware (& software dependencies) can be found running in all sorts of places."

The worst part is that the security flaws were discovered after examining a limited set of 4G routers, covering the entire prices spectrum, from consumer-grade routers and dongles to very pricey devices designed to be used in large enterprise networks.

All the security flaws found were reported to the vendors who fixed most of the discovered issues before the Pen Test Partners report was published but, unfortunately, the disclosure process didn't go as smooth as expected.

## ZTE router vulnerabilities

The vendor that really stood out in the eyes of the researchers was ZTE, who brushed off the vulnerabilities identified in the MF910 and MF65+ routers as they affected end-of-life products—even though, in the case of the MF910, it was still listed on the company's website with no hint at it being out of support (advisory available [HERE](http://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1010203)).

The researcher subsequently tested another ZTE router, the MF920, which shared the same codebase and, as a result, almost the same vulnerabilities. This time, ZTE decided to fix the reported flaws which also got assigned CVE identifiers.

The following issues were discovered while examining the MF910 and MF65 routers, issues that the vendor will not patch:

• The administrator password can be leaked (pre-authentication).

• One of the (post-authentication) debug endpoints is vulnerable to command injection.

• There’s also a Cross-Site Scripting point in a totally unused “test” page.

"These issues could be chained together to allow arbitrary code to be executed on the router, just by a user visiting a malicious webpage," added Richter. More details on the MF910 security analysis can be found [HERE](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/zte-mf910-an-end-of-life-router-running-lots-of-vivacious-hidden-code/).

Two of the vulnerabilities found in the other examined ZTE 4G router, the MF920, received the following CVEs—an advisory issued by the vendor is available [HERE](http://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1010686):

• [CVE-2019-3411](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3411) – Information Leak (7.5 high severity CVSS v3.0 base score)

• [CVE-2019-3412](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-3412) – Arbitrary Command Execution (9.8 critical severity CVSS v3.0 base score)

## Security flaws found in Netgear and TP-LINK 4G routers

The Pen Test Partners researcher also found security issues in 4G routers manufactured by Netgear and TP-LINK, with at least four of them also having been assigned CVEs.

In the case of the Netgear Nighthawk M1 Mobile router, a cross-site request forgery bypass (tracked as [CVE-2019-14526](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14526)) and a post-authentication command injection ([CVE-2019-14527](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14527)) could allow potential attackers to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable device if "the user hasn’t set a strong password on the web interface."

This vulnerability chain could be easily exploited by an attacker by tricking the device's users into visiting a maliciously crafted page. The researcher also provides more info on the [CSRF protection bypass flaw](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/how-not-to-do-cross-site-request-forgery-protection-the-netgear-nighthawk-m1/) and how one can [break Netgear Nighthawk M1's firmware encryption](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/breaking-bad-firmware-encryption-case-study-on-the-netgear-nighthawk-m1/).

TP-LINK's M7350 4G LTE Mobile wireless router was also found to be vulnerable, this time to the following command injection flaws which also got their own CVEs after being disclosed to the vendor:

• [CVE-2019-12103](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12103) – Pre-Authentication Command Execution

• [CVE-2019-12104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-12104) – Post-Authentication Command Execution

"In increasing numbers, lots of less-bandwidth-demanding consumers are inevitably going to start using cellular for their full-time Internet access," [added](https://www.pentestpartners.com/security-blog/reverse-engineering-4g-hotspots-for-fun-bugs-and-net-financial-loss/) the Pen Test Partners researcher.

"Those manufacturers who are going to be selling 5G routers are currently selling 3G and 4G routers. Which – and I really cannot stress this enough – are mainly bad."
