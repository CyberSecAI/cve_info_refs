    "description": "The provided content is related to CVE-2019-14745. It details a command injection vulnerability within radare2's `bin_symbols()` function.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of symbol names extracted from a binary file when processed by radare2. Specifically, the `is*` commands in radare2, which list symbols, use the output of bin_symbols() which does not properly sanitize symbol names before outputting them. This output is then interpreted by radare2's '.' command as commands to be executed, leading to arbitrary command injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Command Injection",
        "Insufficient Input Sanitization",
        "Unsafe use of eval-like functionality"
       ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system where radare2 is running. This can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious binary file that contains specially crafted symbol names. When this file is opened in radare2 and analyzed using the 'ood' or a similar command that calls `r_core_file_reopen_debug()` internally, the injected commands are executed.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires the ability to create or modify binary files. The attacker needs to have the victim open the malicious binary with the vulnerable version of radare2. No special privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, but the impact of the exploitation depends on the privileges of the user running radare2."
    },
    "additional_notes": "The provided content offers a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including a clear description of the vulnerable code, crafting of a payload, exploitation steps, and the fix implemented. This information is more comprehensive than typical CVE descriptions, offering a practical understanding of the attack. The content also demonstrates the exploit using a crafted binary with a malicious symbol name `f sym.imp.\`! sleep 999\` 16 0x0` which injects a sleep command during analysis, or by replacing `gethostname` with `` `! <cmd>`` . The blog post from bananamafia.dev details the discovery process, the exploitation method, and the mitigation which involved quoting the entire command output by `bin_symbols()`."
