Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14273:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a broken access control mechanism regarding files with restricted view permissions that are embedded in content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:**  The system fails to properly enforce view permissions for files that are embedded within published content. Specifically, if a file is protected by requiring certain CMS user groups for direct access, those access restrictions are bypassed when the file is accessed through a link within published content.
- **Bypass of file permissions:** Direct access to the file URL would be denied, but accessing it from a link within content bypasses the permission check

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated users can gain access to files that are intended to be restricted to specific user groups. This is especially concerning for files containing sensitive or confidential information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Embedding in Content:** An attacker doesn't need to directly access the file URL. Instead, they can target protected files by identifying them, and accessing them through links where they are embedded within other content. 
- **Web Browser:** The vulnerability is triggered by a user browsing a website where content with embedded files is displayed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   **Unauthenticated User**: The attacker does not require any special login or CMS privileges.
-   **Knowledge of Protected Files:** The attacker needs to have knowledge or find out files that are protected through restricted access permissions and are embedded in some content.
-   **Access to Website:** The attacker needs access to the public facing website and the pages where the protected files are embedded.
