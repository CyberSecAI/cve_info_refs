  "CVE-2019-14744": {
    "description": "Dominik Penner discovered a flaw in how KConfig interpreted shell commands in desktop files and other configuration files. An attacker may trick users into installing specially crafted files which could then be used to execute arbitrary code, e.g. a file manager trying to find out the icon for a file or any application using KConfig. Thus the entire feature of supporting shell commands in KConfig entries has been removed.",
    "root_cause": "The KConfig library allowed the execution of shell commands within configuration files (like .desktop and .directory files), which were intended to be used for flexible configuration. This capability was implemented by unsafely evaluating environment variables and shell expansions within the  KConfigPrivate::expandString() function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe shell command execution within configuration files.",
      "Mishandling of .desktop and .directory files."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the process loading the configuration file. This could lead to complete system compromise if a user is tricked into installing such files.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious .desktop or .directory files embedded in downloaded archives",
       "Downloaded via exploit kits on users' systems",
      "Viewing a directory via file browser",
      "Drag and dropping a malicious link"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a malicious .desktop or .directory file containing shell commands within the Icon entry (or similar). These files would then need to be delivered to the user through social engineering or other means."
