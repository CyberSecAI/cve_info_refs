**Root cause:** Insecure permissions on the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher" directory, granting full control to BUILTIN\Users.

**Vulnerability:** Local Privilege Escalation

**Impact:** An attacker can replace legitimate executable files within the Ubisoft Game Launcher directory with malicious files, leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges.

**Attack vector:**
1.  The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
2.  Attacker replaces a legitimate executable within the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher" directory with a malicious executable.
3.  When a user executes a replaced executable, the attacker's code will run with the privileges of the user.

**Required attacker capabilities:**
*   Local access to the vulnerable machine.
*   Ability to write files to the "C:\Program Files (x86)\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher" directory.
