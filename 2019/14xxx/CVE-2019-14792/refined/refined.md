The provided content relates to CVE-2019-14792.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user input within the `wpgmaps_head` function in the `/legacy-core.php` file of the WP Google Maps plugin. Specifically, when creating or updating a rectangle on a map, the plugin directly inserts user-provided data into the database without sanitization, and then outputs this data without escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  User-supplied data, specifically the rectangle name, color, and opacity, is saved into the database without sanitization. This unsanitized data is then displayed on the admin pages, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of nonce verification when creating or updating a rectangle allows for CSRF attacks, where an attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into performing unwanted actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the map settings, which is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the admin pages of the plugin. This can lead to session hijacking, unauthorized access to admin accounts, and other malicious activities.
- Through CSRF, an attacker can force a logged-in admin to create or modify map settings, leading to XSS payload injection without the admin's direct interaction.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is initiated by an authenticated user who has access to the admin pages of the WordPress site.
- The attacker submits a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/wp-admin/` endpoint with the `wpgmza_save_rectangle` parameter set.
- The attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within the `rectangle_name`, `rectangle_color` and/or `rectangle_opacity` parameters in the POST request.
- The plugin saves this unsanitized code into the database.
- When an administrator accesses the map edit page in the admin panel, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least subscriber level access, capable of accessing the admin pages.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
