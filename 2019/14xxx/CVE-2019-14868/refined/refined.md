## Analysis of CVE-2019-14868

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14868:

*   **Relates to CVE:** YES
*   **Description:** An issue existed in the handling of environment variables in `ksh` (Korn Shell). Certain environment variables were being interpreted as arithmetic expressions on startup, leading to potential code injection. This vulnerability could allow a local user to execute arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Root Cause:** The Korn Shell interprets the contents of some environment variables on startup as arithmetic expressions.
*   **Vulnerability:** Code Injection. If an attacker can set a specially crafted value in one of these environment variables before a `ksh` shell is executed (either directly or through a script), they could execute arbitrary commands before shell restrictions are in place.
*   **Impact:** A local user may be able to execute arbitrary shell commands. In the case of services and applications that use `ksh` scripts and allow remote users to provide one of the arithmetic environment variables, it could allow an attacker to exploit this issue remotely. An attacker could use this flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions to execute shell commands
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   An attacker sets a specially crafted value in one of the environment variables that `ksh` interprets as an arithmetic expression.
    *   The `ksh` shell is executed (directly or via a script).
    *   The crafted environment variable is interpreted, leading to arbitrary command execution.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to set environment variables before a `ksh` shell is started. For remote exploitation, a service or application must allow remote unauthenticated attackers to provide one of those environment variables.
*   **Affected Systems:**
    *   macOS High Sierra 10.13.6
    *   macOS Mojave 10.14.6
    *   macOS Catalina 10.15.4
    *   Debian 9 (stretch)
    *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, 8
*   **Fix:** The issue was addressed with improved validation of environment variables. The fix involves restricting arbitrary expressions in imported numeric environment variables, allowing only integer literals.
