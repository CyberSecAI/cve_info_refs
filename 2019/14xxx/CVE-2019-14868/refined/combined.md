# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-10-01 08:45:01 UTC  ``` Korn Shell is interpreting the contents of some environment variables on startup as an arithmetic expression and therefore potentially causing code injection vulnerabilities.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c2)  Stephane Chazelas    2019-10-07 10:06:40 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marian Rehak from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c1)) > Acknowledgments: >  > Name: Stephane Chazelas  Actually, most of the issues were found by Oliver Kiddle (zsh developer).   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2019-10-31 10:10:35 UTC  ``` During ksh startup, environment variables that are expected to contain a number are evaluated as an arithmetic expression. If an attacker is able to set specially crafted values in one of these environment variables before a ksh shell is executed (either directly or through a script), he could execute arbitrary commands before shell restrictions are in place.  In case of services and applications that use ksh scripts and allow remote users to provide one of the arithmetic environment variables, it could allow an attacker to exploit this issue.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c18)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-13 14:56:48 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/att/ast/commit/c7de8b641266bac7c77942239ac659edfee9ecd2>   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c20)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-13 15:25:15 UTC  ``` Created ksh tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1790549](show_bug.cgi?id=1790549 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14868 ksh: environment variables on startup are interpreted as arithmetic expression leading to code injection [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c22)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-13 16:16:28 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  No known mitigation available.   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-02-05 12:14:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 Update Services for SAP Solutions  Via RHSA-2020:0431 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0431](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0431)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1757324#c24)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-02-05 14:09:33 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Package        : ksh
Version        : 93u+20120801-3.1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14868

A flaw was found in the way it evaluates certain
environment variables. An attacker could use this
flaw to override or bypass environment restrictions
to execute shell commands. Services and
applications that allow remote unauthenticated
attackers to provide one of those environment
variables could allow them to exploit this issue
remotely.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
93u+20120801-3.1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ksh packages.

For the detailed security status of ksh please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ksh>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
