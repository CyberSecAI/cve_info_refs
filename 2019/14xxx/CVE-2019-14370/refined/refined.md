Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-14370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read within the `Exiv2::MrwImage::readMetadata()` function in `mrwimage.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code attempts to read data from a memory location beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The out-of-bounds read can lead to a crash, causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted image file: A malicious actor would need to create a specially crafted image file (MRW format in this case) that triggers the out-of-bounds read during processing by exiv2.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to provide the crafted MRW image to a user or system that uses the vulnerable version of exiv2. No specific user privileges are required for the attack.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the specific file format and the vulnerability to craft an input that triggers the out-of-bounds read.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided GitHub issue #954 gives a detailed analysis including a sample exploit file (poc1.zip), ASAN output and GDB debug info, which helps to understand the root cause and impact of the vulnerability.
- The Debian LTS advisory DLA-3265-1 confirms this vulnerability exists in exiv2.
- This vulnerability is triggered during the processing of image metadata by exiv2.
