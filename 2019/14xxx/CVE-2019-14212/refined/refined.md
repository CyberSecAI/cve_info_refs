    {
      "vulnerability": "Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability",
      "details": "The application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",
      "impact": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents.",

     {
      "vulnerability": "Incorrect Signature Verification",
       "details": "The application could deliver incorrect signature verification information when handling certain signed XFA documents. This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the “/NeedsRendering” key or “TextField” field when verifying the XFA documents.",
      "impact": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to manipulate document content and deceive users into trusting and signing the manipulated documents.",

      "vulnerability": "Information Disclosure vulnerability",
      "details": "The application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users.",
      "impact": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data.",

      "vulnerability": "Use-After-Free vulnerability",
      "details": "The application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects. This occurs due to the use of a wild pointer or null pointer without proper validation.",

        "vulnerability":"Privilege Escalation vulnerability",
        "details":"The application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability due to the lack of proper validation when performing an update or installing a plugin. This occurs due to the incorrect permission assignment on the resources used by the update service, improper signature validation and incomplete certificate check for the updater, weak randomness setting for the name of the temporary folder during a plugin installation, or improper DLL loading without using the built-in manifest file.",
