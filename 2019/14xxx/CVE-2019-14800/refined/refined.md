The provided content describes an information disclosure vulnerability in the FV Player (FV Flowplayer Video Player) WordPress plugin.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the plugin's improper handling of CSV exports. Specifically, the `csv_export()` function in `/models/email-subscription.php` is accessible to unauthenticated users due to a missing capability check.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `csv_export()` function directly uses the `fv-email-export` GET parameter to fetch the email list ID without proper validation.
- **Missing Authentication:** The `admin_init` hook action used to trigger the `csv_export` function does not verify user authentication or capabilities allowing unauthenticated access.
- **Information Disclosure:** The email subscription list is exported as a CSV file, revealing sensitive information of the plugin's users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain access to email subscription lists stored by the plugin. This information can potentially be used for spamming, phishing, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is a direct HTTP GET request to `/wp-admin/admin-post.php` with the parameters `page=fvplayer` and `fv-email-export=[list_id]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any special capabilities or positions. They can exploit the vulnerability remotely without prior authentication to the WordPress site.
