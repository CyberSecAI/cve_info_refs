Based on the provided content, there are three vulnerabilities discussed in the context of Evolution CMS 2.0.x: a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, and an IFrame Injection vulnerability.  CVE-2019-14518 is not mentioned in the provided text.

**1. Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (Issue #1041):**

*   **Root Cause:** Unsafe embedding of user input into application responses. Specifically, the application stores user-supplied data without proper sanitization, and then renders it in a way that allows malicious JavaScript to execute.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding, allowing stored XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application. This code can then be executed within the browser of any user who views the affected content. Actions include stealing session tokens or login credentials, performing arbitrary actions on behalf of users, or logging keystrokes.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious content is inserted through the template creation feature within the CMS. Specifically, the "description" field and new category location is used to inject the payload.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application with sufficient privileges to create/modify templates.

**2. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability (Issue #1043):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application reflects user-supplied input back in the HTTP response without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization and output encoding, resulting in reflected XSS.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is executed when a user interacts with a crafted URL. Similar to stored XSS, the code can steal credentials, perform actions, etc.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious JavaScript payload is injected via a search parameter in the Document Manager.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious link that a user then clicks on while logged into the application.

**3. IFrame Injection Vulnerability (Issue #1042):**

*   **Root Cause:** The application allows the injection of arbitrary HTML, specifically an iframe, within the template creation feature.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization, allowing IFrame injection.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject an IFrame that loads content from a malicious website, potentially exposing users to further malware or phishing attacks, inserting advertisements, or redirecting to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker injects the iframe payload within the template description and/or template name during the creation of a new template.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be logged into the application with sufficient privileges to create/modify templates.

**Mitigation Recommendations (Common to all):**

*   **Output Encoding:** Convert untrusted input into a safe form before rendering to prevent it from being interpreted as code.
*   **Escaping:** Escape all untrusted data based on the HTML context where the data will be placed.
*  **Input Filtering:** Implement positive or "whitelist" input validation to allow only expected characters.
*   **CSP and X-Frame-Options Headers (For IFrame Injection):** Use Content Security Policy and X-Frame-Options headers to prevent the website from being framed on external sites.

**Note:** The content mentions that the reflected XSS issue was mysteriously fixed by backend updates, however there is no specific information as to what these updates were.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the information, the provided content does not relate to CVE-2019-14518, but it does provide detailed information on three separate vulnerabilities found in Evolution CMS 2.0.x.
