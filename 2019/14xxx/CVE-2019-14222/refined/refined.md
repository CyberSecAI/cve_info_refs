### CVE-2019-14222

The provided content describes a vulnerability in Alfresco Community installations, versions 6.0 and lower, due to the presence of static SSL certificates.

- **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of default, static SSL certificates within Alfresco Community installations.
- **Vulnerability:**
  - **Default SSL Certificates:** Alfresco Community versions 6.0 and below are shipped with static SSL certificates. These certificates are used for:
    - Authentication to the Solr Admin Web Interface.
    - Encrypting client-server traffic.
  - **Exposure of Private Key:** The private key (`alfresco.rsa`) associated with these certificates is also exposed.
- **Impact:**
  - **Solr Admin Web Interface Access:** The default certificate (`browser.p12` with password "alfresco") can be used to authenticate to the Solr Admin Web Interface, granting unauthorized access.
  - **Traffic Decryption:** The exposed private key (`alfresco.rsa`) can be used to decrypt client-server traffic if non-PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) encryption ciphers are used, leading to information disclosure.
  - **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** The private key can be used to perform active Man-in-the-Middle attacks, intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between the client and server.
- **Attack Vectors:**
  - **Authentication to Solr:** An attacker can import the `browser.p12` certificate into their browser and authenticate to the `/solr4/` URL of a vulnerable Alfresco Community instance.
  - **Passive Decryption:** An attacker can capture client-server traffic and decrypt it using the `alfresco.rsa` private key.
  - **Active MitM:** An attacker can use the `alfresco.rsa` private key to launch active Man-in-the-Middle attacks.
- **Attacker Capabilities:**
  - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Alfresco Community instance over the network.
  - **Traffic Capture (for Decryption):** For passive decryption, the attacker needs to be able to capture network traffic between the client and server.
  - **MitM Position (for Active Attacks):** For active MitM attacks, the attacker needs to be in a position to intercept and modify network traffic.
