The provided content is related to CVE-2019-14671.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of the `fints_url` parameter within the Firefly III application when creating a FinTS import job. The application uses `libcurl` to handle connections, but fails to restrict the allowed protocols, allowing the use of the `file://` scheme.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Local File Enumeration:** The application's failure to properly sanitize the `fints_url` input allows attackers to specify a `file://` URI. This leads to the application attempting to access the local file system based on the supplied path.
- **Information Disclosure:** The application returns different error messages depending on whether the file exists or not, which can be used to enumerate files and paths on the server.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can leverage this vulnerability to gain information about the server's local file system. They can enumerate files and directories, potentially leading to the discovery of sensitive configuration files, passwords, or other confidential data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted POST request to the `/import/job/configuration/[unique string]` endpoint, providing a `file://` URI in the `fints_url` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the affected endpoint. The attacker needs to have a valid CSRF token.
