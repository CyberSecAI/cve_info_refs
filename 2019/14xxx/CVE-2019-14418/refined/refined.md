Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue. It arises from the way the application handles user input within the context of resiliency plans functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Persistent XSS:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied data related to resiliency plans before storing it and rendering it on other users' browsers. This allows malicious scripts to be stored and executed later when other users access the affected functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Injection:** A malicious VRP user can inject malicious JavaScript code into another user's browser.
- **Session Hijacking/Stealing Credentials:** An attacker could potentially use XSS to steal session cookies or credentials of other users.
- **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance or content of the application as seen by other users.
- **Redirection to malicious sites:** The attacker could redirect users to malicious websites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Resiliency Plans Functionality:** The vulnerability is located in the user interface or functionality of the application related to resiliency plans.
- **Malicious User Input:** An attacker injects the malicious script through a user input field or other mechanism within the resiliency plan feature.
- **Victim Browsing:** When another legitimate user accesses the affected part of the application (where the malicious script was stored) , their browser executes the injected script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **VRP User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with the ability to create and modify resiliency plans.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to be aware of the user input field or functionality where the malicious script can be injected in the resiliency plans feature.

**Additional Information:**

-   **Severity:** Medium
-   **Affected Products:** All versions of Veritas Resiliency Platform (VRP) before 3.3.2 HF14
-   **CVSS v3 Base Score:** 5.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
