Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the Adaptive Images for WordPress plugin's improper handling of the `$_REQUEST['adaptive-images-settings']` variable. This variable, which controls various plugin settings, can be manipulated by an unauthenticated attacker by simply passing it through the request, allowing for arbitrary modification of critical parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `source_file` parameter within the `$_REQUEST['adaptive-images-settings']` array is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path on the server, which the script will attempt to serve as an image.
*   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The plugin's cache mechanism uses parameters from the same user-controlled `$_REQUEST['adaptive-images-settings']` array to determine which cached files to delete. By manipulating the `source_file`, `cache_file`, `watch_cache`, and other related parameters, an attacker can force the plugin to delete arbitrary files accessible by the WordPress installation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **LFI:** Sensitive files, including system files and WordPress configuration files (e.g., `wp-config.php`), can be read by an attacker. This can lead to the exposure of database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information.
*  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Attackers can delete critical files such as the `wp-config.php`, effectively breaking the website, or any other file they can access.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining LFI and arbitrary file deletion, an attacker can achieve RCE. This can be done by first exfiltrating the `wp-config.php` file, deleting it, installing a fake WordPress instance with a backdoor, and then restoring the original configuration, and using the backdoor to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `adaptive-images-script.php` with a modified `adaptive-images-settings` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged into WordPress or have any special privileges. Any visitor to the website can trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Basic Understanding of HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to send HTTP requests with specific parameters.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerable version is **0.6.66** of the Adaptive Images for WordPress plugin.
* The vulnerability was patched in version **0.6.7**.
* The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Mark Gruffer.
* The plugin uses a cache mechanism to store resized images, which is crucial for the arbitrary file deletion vulnerability.
* The LFI vulnerability does not allow the attacker to control the `Content-Type` header, so the output will be a malformed image.
* The arbitrary file deletion requires a source file that is newer than the target file for the delete operation to occur, which an attacker can easily achieve by specifying an existing image as the source.
