{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the `cam_actuator_driver_cmd` function in the V4l2 driver due to a lack of validation of an object's existence before operations are performed on it.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use-after-free vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute code in the context of the kernel.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access is required.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must first be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system."
