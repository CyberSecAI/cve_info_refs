{
  "CVE-2019-14973": {
    "description": "_TIFFCheckMalloc and _TIFFCheckRealloc in tif_aux.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10 mishandle Integer Overflow checks because they rely on compiler behavior that is undefined by the applicable C standards. This can, for example, lead to an application crash.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the _TIFFCheckMalloc() and _TIFFCheckRealloc() functions due to improper handling of multiplication operations when allocating memory. The code relies on undefined compiler behavior regarding signed integer overflows.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer Overflow",
          "Reliance on Undefined Behavior"
      ],
      "impact": "Application crash or other undefined behavior. Potentially, this could also be exploited for arbitrary code execution if other vulnerabilities are present in the application's memory handling.",
      "attack_vectors": "Processing of a specially crafted TIFF image file, which leads to an integer overflow during memory allocation within the affected function calls.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF image file to an application that uses the vulnerable libtiff library. No special privileges or user interaction is typically required. The vulnerability can be triggered when the application attempts to allocate memory based on parameters within the image file."
    },
    "affected_software": {
        "libtiff": "Versions up to 4.0.10"
    },
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability arises from the library's reliance on undefined C compiler behavior when checking for integer overflows. This can lead to an application crash or potentially other more severe consequences. The fix involves checking for multiplication overflows more robustly, rather than depending on compiler-specific behavior. This issue affects multiple Linux distributions including Debian, Fedora, and openSUSE, which have released security updates to address it."
