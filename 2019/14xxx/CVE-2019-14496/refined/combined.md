# USN-4499-1: MilkyTracker vulnerabilities

15 September 2020

MilkyTracker could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it
opened a specially crafted file.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [milkytracker](/security/cves?package=milkytracker) - music creation tool inspired by Fast Tracker 2

## Details

It was discovered that MilkyTracker did not properly handle certain input. If

a user were tricked into opening a malicious file, an attacker could cause

MilkyTracker to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.

### Reduce your security exposure

## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Jul 29, 2019](https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker/issues/183#issue-474185268)

Hi,

While fuzzing milkytracker with American Fuzzy Lop, I found a stack-based buffer overflow in LoaderXM::load(), in LoaderXM.cpp L646.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it): [test02.xm.gz](https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker/files/3443677/test02.xm.gz)

Issue can be reproduced by running:

```
milkytracker test02.xm

```

```
