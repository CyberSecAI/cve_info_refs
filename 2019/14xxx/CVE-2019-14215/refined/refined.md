      "root_cause": "The provided document contains multiple vulnerabilities and their root causes. The following are the relevant vulnerabilities related to this CVE ID:\n\n1.  **Untrusted URL Invocation:** The application loads images from all resources, including untrusted ones, when parsing image resources. It also fails to request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers. This occurs when handling certain XFA documents.\n\n2. **Incorrect Signature Verification:** The application improperly ignores changes to the “/NeedsRendering” key or “TextField” field when verifying the XFA documents. This occurs when handling signed XFA documents.\n\n3. **Information Disclosure:** The application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions or ignores encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users. This occurs when handling XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the “LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements.",
