- **Root cause of vulnerability:** IntelliJ IDEA was resolving artifacts using an HTTP connection, which is insecure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is due to the use of an unencrypted HTTP connection for downloading artifacts.
- **Impact of exploitation:** This allows for a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, where an attacker can intercept the communication and potentially modify the downloaded artifacts.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, specifically a MITM attack on the HTTP connection used by IntelliJ IDEA to resolve artifacts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned within the network path between IntelliJ IDEA and the artifact server in order to intercept and modify the network traffic.
