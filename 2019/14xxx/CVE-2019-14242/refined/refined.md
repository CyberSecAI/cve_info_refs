- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability of a local attacker to create a malicious DLL file in a system directory, which is then executed by a vulnerable Bitdefender application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Local code injection vulnerability exists because of the way Bitdefender products handle loading DLLs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can achieve local code execution with user rights on the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local. An attacker with administrator privileges can place the malicious DLL in the %SystemRoot%\System32\ directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access with administrator privileges to place the malicious DLL file in the system directory. The user needs to initiate the execution of the injected code.
