  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'notes' parameter when creating a new branch, allowing the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of a user's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal cookies, manipulate the user's session, or redirect the user to malicious websites.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the '/branch/store' endpoint with malicious JavaScript code in the 'notes' parameter.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the application, typically requiring network access to the application."
