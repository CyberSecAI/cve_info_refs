[`dfe1678`](/spdk/spdk/commit/dfe1678b7b1a63de8c452421473fecedcee410fe)

# ftl

EXPERIMENTAL: Added ability to mirror writes to persistent write buffer cache

to allow for recovery from dirty shutdown event.

Added handling of Asynchronous Nand Management Events (ANM).

# vmd

EXPERIMENTAL: Added Intel Volume Management Device (VMD) driver. VMD is an integrated

controller inside the CPU PCIe root complex. It enables virtual HBAs for the connected

NVMe SSDs. `spdk_vmd_init()` enumerates NVMe SSDs behind VMD device and hook them into

SPDK PCI subsystem. `spdk_nvme_probe()` or `spdk_nvme_connect()` can be used to connect

NVMe driver to the device located at the given transport ID.

To obtain transport ID of NVMe SSD behind VMD `spdk_lspci` can be used.

Current implementation does not support hotplug.

# blobfs

Blobfs file asynchronous operations were added to public APIs.

# util

A new file API `spdk_posix_file_load` was added to load file content into a data buffer.

New APIs `spdk_dif_ctx_set_data_offset`, `spdk_dif_verify_stream`,

`spdk_dif_get_range_with_md`, `spdk_dif_get_length_with_md` have been added,

and existing APIs `spdk_dif_ctx_init`, `spdk_dif_set_md_interleave_iovs`, and

`spdk_dif_generate_stream` have been refined to insert or strip DIF by stream

fasion with any alignment.

New APIs `spdk_dif_ctx_set_remapped_init_ref_tag`, `spdk_dif_remap_ref_tag`,

and `spdk_dix_remap_ref_tag` have been added to remap DIF reference tag.

New APIs `spdk_dif_update_crc32c` and `spdk_dif_update_crc32c_stream` have been

added to compute CRC-32C checksum for extended LBA payload.

Bdevperf and bdevio applications now support starting tests with application specific

RPCs. Please see helper Python scripts in their respective directories.

This is a move towards simpler RPC-only configuration for all main

and auxiliary applications.

Legacy INI style configuration for SPDK applications will become deprecated in SPDK 19.10,

and removed in SPDK 20.01. Please consider moving to JSON-RPC configuration files and/or

RPC driven run-time configuration.

# nvmf

EXPERIMENTAL: A Fibre Channel transport that supports Broadcom HBAs has been

added. This depends on the FC HBA driver at

<https://github.com/ecdufcdrvr/bcmufctdrvr>. See [the documentation](https://spdk.io/doc/nvmf.html#nvmf_fc_transport)

for more information.

Persistent reservation emulation has been added to the NVMe-oF target. Persistent reservation

state is stored in a JSON file on the local filesystem between target restart. To support this,

an optional parameter to the RPC method `nvmf_subsystem_add_ns` called `--ptpl-file` was added.

This allows the user to specify which file to store the persistent reservation state in. Note

that this is done per namespace.

The c2h success optimization under which a command capsule response is not sent

for reads is turned on by default. A config knob was added to allow disabling

the optimization. This will mostly be used for integration testing with 5.0.x kernels

while some compatibility fixes make their way down the pipeline for 5.1.x kernels.

The sock priority setting of the TCP connection owned by the tcp transport is added. It is

used to optimize the TCP connection performance under designated traffic classes. And the

priority is used to differeniate the sock priority between SPDK NVMe-oF TCP target application

and other TCP based applications.

Shared receive queue can now be disabled even for NICs that support it using the

`nvmf_create_transport` RPC method parameter `no_srq`. The actual use of a shared

receive queue is predicated on hardware support when this flag is not used.

spdk\_nvmf\_get\_optimal\_poll\_group was added, which is used to return the optimal

poll group for the qpair. And `ConnectionScheduler` configuration is added into the

[Nvmf] section in etc/spdk/nvmf.conf.in to demonstrate how to configure the connection

scheduling strategy among different spdk threads.

Added infrastructure to retrieve global and per poll group NVMf statistics.

DIF strip and insert is now supported for TCP transport. When it is enabled, DIF

setting is not exposed to the NVMe-oF initiator, and DIF is attached into data

for write I/O and stripped from data for read I/O.

Added a field `dif_insert_or_strip` to struct spdk\_nvmf\_transport\_opts, and

updated the related rpc function nvmf\_create\_transport to make this

configurable parameter available to users. The `dif_insert_or_strip` is relevant

for TCP transport for now and used to configure the DIF strip and insert.

Added infrastructure to retrieve NVMf transport statistics.

# notify

The function `spdk_notify_get_types()` and `spdk_notify_get_events()` were

renamed to `spdk_notify_foreach_type()` and `spdk_notify_foreach_event()`,

respectively. And update type name of callback accordingly.

# bdev

The format of the data returned by the get\_bdevs\_iostat RPC has changed to

make it easier to parse. It now returns an object with a "ticks" object

and "bdevs" array with the per-bdev statistics.

A new bdev module `delay` has been added which simulates a drive latency when placed

on top of a Null bdev. This module is intended only for testing and can be created using

the new RPC `bdev_delay_create`. That RPC takes the name of the underlying bdev as well

as average and p99 latency arguments for both read and write operations. Average latency is

defined as a value close to what you would expect a perf tool such as FIO to report back as

the mean latency of all I/O submitted to the drive. p99 latency is defined as the value one

would expect the drive to see the slowest 1% of I/O report. For underlying drives with already

significant latency, the latency values provided to the drive will be additive. This should be

taken into account if trying to achieve an artificial latency on top of an nvme drive or aio device.

DIF reference tag remapping is now supported for partition type virtual bdev

modules. When using partition type virtual bdevs, block address space is

remapped during I/O processing and DIF reference tag is remapped accordingly.

Added spdk\_bdev\_\*\_with\_md() functions allowing for IO with metadata being transferred in

separate buffer. To check support for separatate metadata, use spdk\_bdev\_is\_md\_separate().

All bdevs now have a UUID. For devices whose backing hardware does not provide a UUID,

one is automatically generated. Across runs of SPDK, bdevs whose UUID is automatically

generated may change.

A new virtual bdev module `compress` has been added to provide compression services on top of

a thinly provisioned logical volume. See documentation for complete details.

# nvme

Added an optional parameter `--io-queue-requests` to RPC `set_bdev_nvme_options`, which

can be used to change the number of requests allocated for one NVMe I/O queue. For

very big I/O size, e.g. 128MiB, with this option user will not get an error due to

limited requests in NVMe driver layer.

Added spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_get\_transport\_id() to get the transport ID from a

previously attached controller.

Nvme Opal library spdk\_opal\_cmd deprecated. Adding seperate command APIs.

NVMe Opal library add support for activating locking SP which will make the transaction

from "Manufactured-Inactive" state to "Manufactured" state. Upon successfully invoking

of this method, lock and unlock features will be enabled.

NVMe Opal library add support for locking/unlocking range and list locking range info.

NVMe opal library add support for multiuser. Admin can enable user and add user to specific

locking range and the user can lock/unlock his range.

Added spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_io\_cmd\_raw\_no\_payload\_build() allowing a caller to pass

a completely formed command to an NVMe submission queue (buffer addresses and all).

This is supported on the PCIe transport only.

Added spdk\_nvme\_get\_ctrlr\_registers() to return a pointer to the virtual address

of the NVMe controller registers. This is supported on the PCIe transport only.

Added additional options to the spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_alloc\_qpair() option parameter

structure to allow caller to override the virtual and optionally physical address

of the submission and completion queue pair to be created. This is supported on

the PCIe transport only.

Added `disable_error_logging` to struct spdk\_nvme\_ctrlr\_opts, which disables

logging of failed requests. By default logging is enabled.

Added spdk\_nvme\_qpair\_print\_command(), spdk\_nvme\_qpair\_print\_completion() and

spdk\_nvme\_cpl\_get\_status\_string(). Allowing for easier display of error messages.

Added support for NVMe Sanitize command.

# env

The parameter `free_space` has been added to spdk\_ring\_enqueue() to wait when

the ring is almost full and resume when there is enough space available in

the ring.

A new API `spdk_mempool_lookup` has been added to lookup the memory pool created

by the primary process.

Added spdk\_pci\_get\_first\_device() and spdk\_pci\_get\_next\_device() to allow

iterating over PCI devices detected by SPDK. Because of this, all SPDK APIs

to attach/detach PCI devices are no longer thread safe. They are now meant to

be called from only a single thread only, the same only that called spdk\_env\_init().

This applies to the newly added APIs as well.

# vpp

SPDK now supports VPP version 19.04.2, up from VPP 18.01.

VPP socket abstraction now uses VPP Session API, instead of VLC (VPP Communications Library).

This allows for better control over sessions and queues.

Please see VPP documentation for more details:

[VPP Host Stack](https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/HostStack)

# sock

Add spdk\_sock\_get\_optimal\_sock\_group(), which returns the optimal sock group for

this socket. When a socket is created, it is often assigned to a sock group using

spdk\_sock\_group\_add\_sock so that a set of sockets can be polled more efficiently.

For some network devices, it is optimal to assign particular sockets to specific

sock groups. This API is intended to provide the user with that information.

spdk\_sock\_group\_get\_ctx() was added to return the context of the spdk\_sock\_group.

spdk\_sock\_group\_create() is updated to allow input the user provided ctx.

spdk\_sock\_set\_priority() is added to set the priority of the socket.

# rpc

Added thread\_get\_stats RPC method to retrieve existing statistics.

Added nvmf\_get\_stats RPC method to retrieve NVMf susbsystem statistics.

Response buffers for RPC requests are now always pre-allocated, which implies

that all spdk\_jsonrpc\_begin\_result() calls always succeed and return a valid

buffer for JSON response. RPC calls no longer need to check if the buffer is

non-NULL.

Added SPDK\_RPC\_REGISTER\_ALIAS\_DEPRECATED to help with deprecation process when

renaming existing RPC. First time a deprecated alias is used, it will print

a warning message.

RPC `get_rpc_methods` was renamed `rpc_get_methods`. The old name is still usable,

but is now deprecated.

# blobstore

A snapshot can now be deleted if there is only a single clone on top of it.

# build

Preliminary support for cross compilation is now available. Targeting an older

CPU on the same architecture using your native compiler can be accomplished by

using the `--target-arch` option to `configure` as follows:

```
./configure --target-arch=broadwell

```

Additionally, some support for cross-compiling to other architectures has been

added via the `--cross-prefix` argument to `configure`. To cross-compile, set CC

and CXX to the cross compilers, then run configure as follows:

```
./configure --target-arch=aarm64 --cross-prefix=aarch64-linux-gnu

```
# vhost

A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in SPDK Vhost-SCSI target.

A malicious client (e.g. a virtual machine) could send a carefully prepared,

invalid I/O request to crash the entire SPDK process. All users of SPDK Vhost-SCSI

target are strongly recommended to update. All SPDK versions < 19.07 are affected.

By default, SPDK will now rely on upstream DPDK's rte\_vhost instead of its fork

located inside SPDK repo. The internal fork is still kept around to support older

DPDK versions, but is considered legacy and will be eventually removed.

`configure` will now automatically use the upstream rte\_vhost if the used DPDK

version is >= 19.05.

spdk\_vhost\_init() is now asynchronous and accepts a completion callback.

# iscsi target

A security vulnerability has been identified and fixed in SPDK iSCSI target.

A malicious client (e.g. an iSCSI initiator) could send a carefully prepared,

invalid I/O request to crash the entire SPDK process. All users of SPDK iSCSI

target are strongly recommended to update. All SPDK versions < 19.07 are affected.

# thread

Exposed spdk\_set\_thread() in order for applications to associate

with SPDK thread when necessary.

Added spdk\_thread\_destroy() to allow framework polling the thread to

release resources associated with that thread.

# ocf

Updated OCF submodule to OCF v19.3.2

Added support for many-to-one configuration for OCF bdev.

Multiple core devices can now be cached on single cache device.

Added persistent metadata support, allowing to restore cache state after shutdown.

During start of SPDK application, the devices are examined and if OCF metadata

is present - appropriate OCF bdevs will be recreated.

Added Write-Back mode support. In this mode, data is first written to

caching device and periodically synchronized to the core devices.

Dirty data is saved as persistent metadata on cache device,

allowing for safe restore during application restart.

For more details please see OCF documentation:
