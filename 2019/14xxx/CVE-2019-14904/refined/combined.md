Package        : ansible
Version        : 2.2.1.0-2+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7481 CVE-2019-10156 CVE-2019-14846
                 CVE-2019-14904
Debian Bug     : 862666 930065 942188

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in ansible, a configuration
management, deployment, and task execution system.

CVE-2017-7481

    Ansible fails to properly mark lookup-plugin results as unsafe. If an
    attacker could control the results of lookup() calls, they could inject
    Unicode strings to be parsed by the jinja2 templating system, resulting in
    code execution. By default, the jinja2 templating language is now marked as
    'unsafe' and is not evaluated.

CVE-2019-10156

    A flaw was discovered in the way Ansible templating was implemented,
    causing the possibility of information disclosure through unexpected
    variable substitution. By taking advantage of unintended variable
    substitution the content of any variable may be disclosed.

CVE-2019-14846

    Ansible was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of
    credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG
    level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in
    a separate process.

CVE-2019-14904

    A flaw was found in the solaris_zone module from the Ansible Community
    modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone
    name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the
    remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting
    the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

### @Akasurde **[Akasurde](/Akasurde)** commented [Dec 10, 2019](#issue-535668421)

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2019-14904](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gwr8-5j83-483c "CVE-2019-14904") - solaris\_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that.

However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions.

A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands

into the server manipulating the module behaviour.

Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.

However, while running these actions on the system, solaris_zone module check the status of the zone by executing a os.system() call and using the zone name as a parameter. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-26 15:50:00 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Abhijeet Kasurde (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c4)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-28 05:49:43 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1777690](show_bug.cgi?id=1777690 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14904 ansible: vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1777689](show_bug.cgi?id=1777689 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14904 ansible: vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1777688](show_bug.cgi?id=1777688 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-14904 ansible: vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2019-12-04 12:06:49 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c11)  Borja Tarraso    2020-01-02 14:04:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  Because a flaw exploit would depend on the use of Solaris and Red Hat does not support RHOSP on Solaris, the RHOSP Ansible package will not be updated at this time.

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 0, < 2.7.16
>= 2.8.0a1, < 2.8.8

## Description

A flaw was found in the solaris\_zone module from the Ansible Community modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host. Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are affected.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
