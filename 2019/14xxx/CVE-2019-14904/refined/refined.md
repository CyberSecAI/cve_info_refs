Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-14904:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `solaris_zone` module in Ansible did not properly validate user input for the zone name. It used the provided zone name in a `os.system()` call, specifically when checking the status of the zone by listing processes using the `ps` command on the remote Solaris host.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **OS Command Injection:**  The lack of input validation allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands through a specially crafted zone name.
- **Improper Input Validation:** The `solaris_zone` module failed to sanitize the zone name before passing it to the `ps` command.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the remote Solaris host with the privileges of the user running the Ansible task by crafting a malicious zone name.
- **Manipulation of Module Behavior**: The vulnerability allows for controlling the behaviour of the solaris_zone module through the injected commands.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to control the input for the `zone` parameter of the `solaris_zone` module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to define the `zone` parameter used by the Ansible `solaris_zone` module.
- The attacker must be able to execute an ansible playbook that uses the vulnerable `solaris_zone` module.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Ansible versions prior to 2.7.16, 2.8.8 and 2.9.3.
- A fix was implemented by adding user input validation based on Solaris Zone documentation.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a High severity issue with a CVSS score of 8.3.
- Affected versions include: >= 0, < 2.7.16, >= 2.8.0a1, < 2.8.8, >= 2.9.0a1, < 2.9.3
- Patched versions are: 2.7.16, 2.8.8, 2.9.3
- The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-gwr8-5j83-483c
