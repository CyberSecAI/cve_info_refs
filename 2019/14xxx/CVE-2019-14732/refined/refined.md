Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-14732:

*   **Vulnerability:** Multiple heap-based buffer overflows.
*   **Location:** `Ca2mLoader::load()` function in `a2m.cpp` within the AdPlug library.
*   **Root Cause:** The `Ca2mLoader::load()` function in `a2m.cpp` has insufficient bounds checking, leading to heap-based buffer overflows.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a specially crafted `.a2m` file to AdPlug, an attacker can trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Versions:** AdPlug 2.3.1

The provided github issue ([https://github.com/adplug/adplug/issues/88](https://github.com/adplug/adplug/issues/88)) includes:

*   The reporter (@fcambus) identified two specific locations for the overflows, at `src/a2m.cpp` lines 106 and 184.
*   Reproducer `.a2m` files are attached for testing/verification.
*   AddressSanitizer output showing the crash and stack trace.

The Fedora update announcements indicate that the vulnerability was fixed in AdPlug version 2.3.3.
