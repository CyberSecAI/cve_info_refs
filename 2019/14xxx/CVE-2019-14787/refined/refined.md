### CVE-2019-14787

The provided content describes a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Newsletters" WordPress plugin.

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin outputs the value of the GET or POST input "contentarea" without proper escaping.
*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the `ajax_load_new_editor` function is vulnerable because it directly outputs the `contentarea` parameter without sanitization.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will be executed in the victim's browser. This can lead to stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a malicious URL with the `contentarea` parameter containing JavaScript code.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in WordPress user to click on the malicious link. The user must be logged into WordPress for the AJAX functionality to be accessible.

**Proof of Concept (PoC):**

```
http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=newsletters_load_new_editor&contentarea="><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>
```
