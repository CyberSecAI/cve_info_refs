The content is related to CVE-2019-14355.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that a device's power consumption fluctuates based on what is displayed on its screen. By measuring these subtle power differences, an attacker can potentially deduce what is being displayed on the screen, even without directly viewing it. This is a side-channel attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness lies in the power fluctuations of the KeepKey's screen when displaying sensitive information like the recovery phrase during setup.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially steal the user's recovery phrase and gain access to their funds.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves measuring the subtle differences in power drawn from the screen while sensitive information (recovery phrase) is displayed.
- This requires physical access to the KeepKey and specialized equipment to measure electrical signals on the USB interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Physical access to the KeepKey device.
- Specialized equipment like an oscilloscope for power measurement.
- Hardware skills to measure electrical signals on the USB interface without disrupting it.
- Capability for statistical data analysis to correlate power draw with specific words on the screen.
