  "CVE-2019-14234": {
    "description": "An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. Due to an error in shallow key transformation, key and index lookups for django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField, and key lookups for django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField, were subject to SQL injection. This could, for example, be exploited via crafted use of \"OR 1=1\" in a key or index name to return all records, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, as the \*\*kwargs passed to the QuerySet.filter() function.",

      "root_cause": "Shallow key transformation error in django.contrib.postgres.fields.JSONField and django.contrib.postgres.fields.HStoreField.",

        "SQL injection"

        "Crafted dictionary with SQL injection payloads in keys or indexes passed to QuerySet.filter() via **kwargs."

      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to influence the `**kwargs` parameter passed to `QuerySet.filter()` function.",
      "additional_info": "The vulnerability arises due to an error in the shallow key transformation process which leads to unsanitized SQL queries, which can then be exploited through specially constructed inputs."
