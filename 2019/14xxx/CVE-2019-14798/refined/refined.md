Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of user-provided input within a `require_once` statement. Specifically, the `gallery_type` parameter from the plugin's shortcode is used to construct a file path that is then included, leading to Local File Inclusion (LFI).

**Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to include arbitrary local files by manipulating the `gallery_type` parameter. This is achieved through directory traversal (e.g., `../../../../`).
*   **Insecure Shortcode Creation:** Any logged-in WordPress user, including those with Subscriber roles, can create new shortcodes using the plugin's interface. While Subscribers cannot directly execute shortcodes, this capability enables exploitation of the LFI via crafted shortcodes by users with Contributor level and above.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By including a specially crafted PHP file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to complete server compromise, data theft, website defacement, and other malicious activities.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially read sensitive files from the server, such as configuration files or database credentials, by including them through the LFI vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Shortcode Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `gallery_type` parameter within the plugin's shortcode, using directory traversal to include arbitrary PHP files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated WordPress User:** The attacker needs to be logged into WordPress with at least Contributor level privileges. While lower level users can create vulnerable shortcodes, they can not exploit them directly without higher privileges.
*   **Ability to Create Shortcodes:** The attacker needs the ability to create shortcodes, which is possible for all logged-in users via the plugin.
*   **Knowledge of WordPress File Structure:** The attacker needs to know the location of files they want to include, relative to the WordPress installation.

**Additional Details**
*   The plugin's shortcode is not registered when accessing admin pages, preventing direct exploitation by lower-level users on admin pages.

The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to include a `test.php` file located in the root directory of the WordPress installation.
