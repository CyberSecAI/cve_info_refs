Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14367:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-14367

**Affected Product:** Slack-chat plugin through 1.5.5 for WordPress

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of sensitive information within the Slack-chat plugin for WordPress. Specifically, the plugin includes a Slack Access Token directly within its source code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insecure Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of a Slack Access Token directly in the plugin's source code. This exposes the token to unauthorized access if the code is compromised.
- **Information Leakage:** By embedding the access token, the plugin leaks a secret that should have been protected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Slack Data:** An attacker who gains access to the leaked Slack Access Token can obtain a significant amount of information about the victim's Slack workspace. This includes details about channels, members, and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Source Code Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining access to the plugin's source code, where the Slack Access Token is located. This could occur through various means, such as:
  - Direct access to the server hosting the WordPress site.
  - Exploiting a different vulnerability on the WordPress site that allows access to files.
  - Compromise of the plugin itself.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Source Code:** An attacker needs the ability to read the files of the WordPress installation where the vulnerable plugin is installed.
- **Basic understanding of WordPress and plugin structure**: Ability to identify where in the plugin the token is being stored.

**Additional Notes:**
- This is an instance of poor security practices by the developers of the WordPress plugin. They should have stored the token in a more secure manner, such as using secure environment variables or a configuration setting.
- This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2019-14365 and CVE-2019-14366, which affect other WordPress plugins.
