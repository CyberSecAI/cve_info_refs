- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient checks on uploaded archive data during the import of site configurations, allowing non-configuration scripts to be included in the uploaded archive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Disclosure and Remote Code Execution
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could upload and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: Uploading malicious configuration archives through the user interface or command-line.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the "Synchronize, import, and export configuration" permission, typically granted only to trusted administrators. The server also must support a server-side scripting language other than PHP to execute the uploaded malicious scripts.
