Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-14985:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the lack of access control for the 'CMD_EXEC' virtual device type 28 within the CUxD AddOn for eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3. This virtual device allows executing arbitrary commands on the system.  The vulnerability is triggered because this function can be called without authentication when the CUxD addon is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The CUxD addon's 'CMD_EXEC' virtual device type does not enforce proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The ability to execute arbitrary commands on the system directly translates to RCE.
*   **Unprotected CUxD 'CMD_EXEC' Virtual Device:** The CUxD 'CMD_EXEC' virtual device (type 28) is not protected against external usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected Homematic CCU2 or CCU3 system.
*   **Full System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete control over the affected device, allowing attackers to potentially:
    *   Modify system configurations.
    *   Access sensitive data.
    *   Install malware.
    *   Control connected smart home devices.
    *   Cause a Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the CCU's web interface.
*   **Unprotected URLs:** Using a URL ending with `.exe` or leveraging other AddOns with unprotected scripts like `exec.cgi` an unauthenticated attacker can trigger the execution of commands.
*   **CUxD AddOn:** The CUxD AddOn itself is the vulnerable component, making systems with this addon installed vulnerable if reachable by an attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the web interface of the Homematic CCU2 or CCU3 device.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **CUxD AddOn Installed:** The CUxD AddOn must be installed and enabled on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including example curl commands demonstrating how to exploit it.
*   It highlights how this vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities in other AddOns (XML-API, HM-Print, HM-Email, Script Parser) to achieve RCE.
*   The vendor (eQ-3) considers AddOns as out of their scope of responsibility
*   The developer of the CUxD AddOn was contacted but no patch was made available
