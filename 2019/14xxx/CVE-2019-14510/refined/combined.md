Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) plays a pivotal role in the IT management strategy by allowing managed service providers (MSPs) and IT professionals to oversee and control IT systems remotely.

It includes automating routine maintenance tasks, monitoring system health and promptly addressing issues, ensuring operational efficiency and minimizing downtime. RMM facilitates proactive rather than reactive management, significantly reducing the risk of unforeseen IT failures and enhancing the overall security posture of the network.

Kaseya VSA leverages powerful RMM capabilities, enabling IT teams to deliver superior service management, automate IT processes and secure environments against evolving cyberthreats.

### [How Does RMM Differ From Endpoint Management?](#accordion-1-collapse-2)

RMM and endpoint management, while overlapping in their functionality, cater to distinct aspects of IT management.

RMM provides a broader, more comprehensive approach to monitoring and managing IT infrastructure, covering servers, networks and devices remotely. It focuses on overall system health, security and efficiency.

On the other hand, endpoint management specifically targets the security and compliance of end-user devices, ensuring they adhere to organizational policies and standards.

Kaseya VSA integrates both aspects, offering a unified solution that not only monitors and manages IT infrastructure but also ensures endpoint security, making IT management seamless and more efficient.

### [What Is the Difference Between MDM and RMM?](#accordion-1-collapse-3)

The distinction between Mobile Device Management (MDM) and Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) lies in their specialized focus areas within IT management. MDM is dedicated to managing and securing mobile devices, enforcing policies and protecting corporate data on smartphones and tablets.

Conversely, RMM offers a broader scope, enabling remote management of the entire IT infrastructure, including servers, workstations and network devices, not just mobile units. Kaseya VSA encompasses functionalities that support both MDM and RMM, providing a comprehensive toolset for managing and securing the diverse components of IT environments effectively.

### [What to Look for in the Best RMM Software?](#accordion-1-collapse-4)

In the search for the best RMM software, consider features that enhance operational efficiency and scalability to accommodate growth, robust automation capabilities, stringent security measures and insightful reporting tools. Additionally, the integration capabilities with other IT management solutions, such as Kaseya VSA, are crucial.

Kaseya VSA stands out by offering an all-encompassing RMM solution that not only meets these criteria but also integrates seamlessly with IT documentation solutions, enabling IT professionals to manage their environments more effectively and securely while driving superior service delivery.

### [Why do you need RMM?](#accordion-1-collapse-5)

RMM is a crucial tool for MSPs to support smooth business operations, boost technician efficiency and enhance service delivery for the highly distributed IT environments of their clients. RMM software also empowers internal IT teams to leverage automation and seamless workflow integrations to streamline their IT operations and ‘do more with less'. In essence, RMM supercharges IT service providers by eliminating inefficiency with all-in-one endpoint management, automation, and protection so they can get ahead of the curve.

### [What are the benefits of RMM?](#accordion-1-collapse-6)

Here's a list of key benefits of RMM that both MSPs and internal IT teams value most:

* **Comprehensive visibility through proactive remote monitoring:** RMM provides IT professionals with the visibility they need to proactively supervise, control and secure IT systems and networks, regardless of their location.
* **Boost efficiency with powerful automation:** RMM tools provide powerful automation capabilities to supercharge technician efficiency by accelerating critical processes such as ticketing, security and backup. Leading RMMs empower your business to auto-remediate common IT problems and tickets.
* **Protect every endpoint with a complete solution:** Powered by advanced security modules such as EDR, DDoS, Managed SOC, AV, WAF and more, RMM solutions help protect all your as well as your client's endpoints (on-premises, hybrid and cloud) against sophisticated cyberthreats.
* **Streamline IT management from a single pane of glass:** A leading RMM has seamless integrations with other critical workflows such as PSA, IT documentation, backup, security and compliance. RMM solutions enable you to streamline your IT operations from a single pane of glass, saving crucial technician time that would otherwise be spent switching between multiple applications.
* **Faster resolution of IT issues:** Given the level of visibility the RMM platform provides, it is easier for IT service providers to quickly and proactively detect and remediate IT issues before they get out of hand.
* **IT management on the go:** Advanced RMM tools enable MSPs and internal IT teams to manage their IT infrastructure from an all-in-one app. The app enables you to run automation scripts as well as create, update and close tickets on the go.
### [What are RMM tools?](#accordion-1-collapse-7)

RMM tools are designed to perform the remote monitoring and management function with which IT service providers can remotely support and control the on- and off-network devices in their IT environments. The RMM tool provides the IT team with remote control over the network and involves processes such as:

* Software installation and patch management
* Monitoring and alerts
* Discovery and inventory management
* Remote control
* Auto-remediation of common problems through automation
* Security
### [How does RMM software work?](#accordion-1-collapse-8)

RMM's deploy an agent, which is a lightweight software installed on client servers, hypervisors, workstations, networking devices, laptops and all other devices connected to the network.

This agent allows technicians to get real-time insights on the health of the client's IT environment and to control and monitor remote devices.

The RMM agents can connect without VPN and firewalls, hence when you install an RMM agent onto a device, the RMM platform can recognize it from anywhere, allowing technicians to control devices remotely.

### [Who uses RMM software?](#accordion-1-collapse-9)

Both MSPs and internal IT teams need the best RMM available. Internal and external IT service providers can leverage RMM tools to manage their endpoints, ensure maximum uptime and automate common IT processes.

Internal IT teams using RMM tools may not call them “RMM” per se since the commonly used terms are “endpoint management software” or “network monitoring software,” but in any case, the functions being used are the same.

### [What should I look for in RMM?](#accordion-1-collapse-10)

Given the plethora of options available, choosing a robust RMM tool like Kaseya VSA that works for you can be a challenge. Here's a list of things to consider when evaluating RMM software:

* A complete solution that integrated seamlessly into your existing IT stack.
* Powerful automation with a library of automation scripts to enhance technician efficiency, increasing productivity and minimizing errors.
* Best-in-class security is another indispensable feature that the ideal RMM solution must offer you.
* The tool must be easy to onboard regardless of the unique needs of your organization.
* Easy navigation and intuitiveness are important attributes of an RMM to resolve issues faster
* The RMM tool must offer seamless integration with other workflows such as IT documentation, PSA, security, backup and more.
* The tool should be priced right so you get the maximum value for your investment.
* The tool should be scalable and designed to grow with the unique needs of your business.
