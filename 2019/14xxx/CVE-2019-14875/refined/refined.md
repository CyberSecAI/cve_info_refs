Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-14875:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:**  The `__multiply` function in the `newlib` C library's `mprec.c` file doesn't check the return value of the `Balloc` function, which is used to allocate a big integer. If `Balloc` fails and returns NULL, the code proceeds to dereference this NULL pointer.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from a missing NULL check after a memory allocation. This leads to a NULL pointer dereference when the allocated memory is accessed.
*   **Impact:** This leads to a NULL pointer dereference. In embedded systems, this can cause the processor to attempt to read or write from/to address 0x0, potentially causing a crash. It could also overwrite interrupt handlers or redirect program execution if the device vector table is mapped to or near this address.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker needs to cause a memory allocation failure by, for example, forcing a low memory condition on the device. This can be done, for example, by a string formatting function that includes floating point numbers that rely on the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable `__multiply` function in a situation where memory allocation fails.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerable code snippet is:
    ```c
    b = Balloc (ptr, 1);
    b->_x[0] = i;
    ```
*   The vulnerability occurs when the call to `Balloc` returns NULL because of a memory allocation failure, and the program then attempts to dereference `b` by accessing `b->_x[0]`.
*   The `_x` member is accessed without checking if `b` is NULL.

**Additional Information:**

*   This vulnerability is part of a group of similar NULL pointer dereferences in `newlib` all caused by lack of NULL checks after `Balloc`, which is a memory allocation function for "big integers" used by multiple functions (such as `__multiply`, `__i2b`, `__multadd`, etc).
*   The document states that these issues were found during a security assessment of a firmware binary, and it was easier to find them by analyzing the resulting binary than by static analysis, due to preprocessor macros and function level indirections hiding the root cause.
*   The document also points out that the widespread use of the `newlib` library in embedded devices makes this a significant issue, as many of these devices may not receive security updates and remain vulnerable.
*   The document recommends updating to newlib version 3.3.0 with the `newlib-reent-check-verify` option enabled to prevent this class of bugs.
