The provided content contains information about multiple CVEs affecting MicroDigital N-series cameras.  Specifically, the information for **CVE-2019-14698** is present, along with several others (CVE-2019-14699 through CVE-2019-14708) which need to be processed separately.

Here's the breakdown for **CVE-2019-14698**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a CGI program running under the HTTPD web server. The vulnerability is specifically located in the processing of the "param" parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Buffer Overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Remote code execution in the context of the "nobody" account.
* Potential for denial of service (DoS).
* Potential for privilege escalation.
* Potential for information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
* The attacker can exploit the buffer overflow by sending a crafted HTTP request to the web server, targeting the vulnerable CGI program and overflowing the "param" parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device's web server.
* No authentication is mentioned to be required, implying that the attack may be possible without authentication

**Additional Notes:**
* The vendor was contacted but refused to fix the vulnerability due to the dissolution of the development team responsible for this firmware.
* A Proof of Concept (PoC) exists demonstrating the exploitability of this issue.
