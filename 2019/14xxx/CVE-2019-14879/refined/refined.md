Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-14879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Moodle where removing a cohort role assignment does not revoke the associated capabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Role Revocation:** When a user's role assignment within a cohort is removed, the system fails to properly revoke the capabilities that were granted through that role. This means that even after a user is no longer associated with a specific role within a cohort, they may still retain the permissions granted by that role, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Missing Security Check:** The system lacks a mechanism or check to ensure that user permissions are properly updated when roles are removed, leaving residual capabilities assigned to users that should not have them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality:** Unauthorized users retain access to sensitive data due to the residual capabilities.
*   **Data Integrity:** Unauthorized users with leftover permissions can modify or corrupt data.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Users who should no longer have certain privileges retain them, leading to potential misuse.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would require an initial role within a cohort, and then would need to have that role removed in order to retain the permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a role assigned within a cohort.
* The attacker's role in the cohort must be removed, triggering the vulnerability and leaving the attacker with permissions they should no longer have.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 3.7 to 3.7.2, 3.6 to 3.6.6, 3.5 to 3.5.8, and earlier versions.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the associated capabilities are revoked when a cohort role assignment is removed.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as Bug 1788383 in Red Hat Bugzilla.
