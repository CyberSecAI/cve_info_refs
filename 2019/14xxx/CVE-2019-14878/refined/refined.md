{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The __d2b function in newlib's mprec.c uses Balloc to allocate a big integer but doesn't check the return value. When Balloc fails and returns a NULL pointer, a subsequent access to the _x member of the NULL pointer triggers a null pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
      "Missing check for memory allocation failure"
    ],
    "impact": "A NULL pointer dereference will force the processor to read bytes or write bytes at an offset from the 0x0 memory address. In some cases, it may allow to execute code referenced through a function pointer found in these first few bytes of memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when memory allocation fails within the __d2b function.  This can be caused when a floating point formatting function is called under low memory conditions.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to cause the device to enter a low memory condition and trigger the vulnerable code path (e.g., by calling a string formatting function that includes floating point numbers)."
