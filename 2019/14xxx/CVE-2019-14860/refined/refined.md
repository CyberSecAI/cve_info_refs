Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14860:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the insecure default configuration of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Syndesis, the underlying code for Fuse Online.
- The `setAllowedOrigins` value was set to allow all origins (`CorsConfiguration.ALL`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure CORS Configuration:** The vulnerability stems from the overly permissive CORS setting, which allows any origin to access resources. This bypasses the intended security mechanism of CORS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers could leverage the lack of cross-origin protection to conduct phishing attacks.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by exploiting the permissive CORS policy.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Cross-Origin Requests:** An attacker could make requests from a malicious website or application to the vulnerable Syndesis instance.
- **Phishing Websites:** An attacker could embed malicious scripts into a website that would make unauthorized requests to the Syndesis server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Attacker:** An attacker does not require any special access to the target system, only the ability to make HTTP requests.
- **Malicious Code Deployment:** An attacker would need to create a malicious website or application capable of making cross-origin requests to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Red Hat Fuse 7.4.1 and 7.5.0, as indicated by RHSA-2019:3244 and RHSA-2019:3892 respectively.
- The bug report ([Bug 1761912](show_bug.cgi?id=1761912)) provides additional context and history about the fix.
- The vulnerable code can be found in `io.syndesis.server.runtime.SecurityConfiguration.java`, specifically the line setting allowed origins to `CorsConfiguration.ALL`.
