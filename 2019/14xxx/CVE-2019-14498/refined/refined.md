## CVE-2019-14498

The vulnerability is a divide-by-zero error in the `Control` function of `demux/caf.c` in VideoLAN VLC media player 3.0.7.1.

**Root cause:** A divide-by-zero error

**Vulnerability:** Division by zero

**Attack vector:** By enticing a user to open a crafted CAF file.

**Impact:** Exploitation triggers a floating-point exception (FPE), leading to a denial of service. A malicious third party could trigger either a crash of VLC or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the target user. ASLR and DEP help reduce the likelihood of code execution but may be bypassed.

**Affected versions:** VLC media player 3.0.7.1 and earlier.

**Mitigation:** Refrain from opening files from untrusted third parties or accessing untrusted remote sites (or disable the VLC browser plugins) until the patch is applied. Upgrade to VLC media player 3.0.8, which addresses the issue.
