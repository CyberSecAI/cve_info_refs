Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14846:

**Content Verification:**

The provided content from multiple sources (Red Hat, SUSE, GitHub, Debian, openSUSE) and bug trackers (Bugzilla) is related to CVE-2019-14846. This is explicitly stated in the bug reports, security advisories, and commit messages referencing the CVE. The content consistently describes a vulnerability in Ansible where credentials could be disclosed in logs when the `no_log` option is enabled, due to improper logging configuration in plugins using the boto3 library.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from Ansible plugins using the boto3 library. This library, under default debug mode, logs credentials. When Ansible's overall logging was set to `DEBUG` level (through the `LOG_PATH` setting), the boto3 library inherited this, causing credentials to be logged to the specified log file even if `no_log` was set for specific tasks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the improper handling of the `no_log` option in conjunction with the logging verbosity level, leading to sensitive information being exposed in logs.  Specifically, it's that some plugins were using boto3 which logs credentials at debug level, and Ansible was setting the global log level to debug.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in the disclosure of sensitive AWS credentials (or potentially other sensitive information if other plugins with similar logging behavior were present) in log files.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is primarily through the logging mechanism itself.  An attacker would need access to the log files to exploit the vulnerability. Additionally, the attacker would need to induce the execution of a vulnerable ansible plugin which might involve some form of social engineering. 
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs:
    *   Access to Ansible's log files that may contain the leaked information.
    *   The ability to trigger a playbook or a task using the affected plugins. 
    *   Ansible to be configured to run with at least `-v` verbosity.

**Additional Information from Content:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects plugins that utilize the `boto3` library for AWS interactions. 
*   The vulnerability does *not* affect Ansible modules, as these are executed in separate processes, and not susceptible to the same logging issue.
*   The fix involves switching the logging level of the boto3 library to `INFO` instead of `DEBUG`.
* Multiple affected versions are identified: ansible-engine 2.8.5 and prior, ansible-engine 2.7.13 and prior, and ansible-engine 2.6.19 and prior.
* Specific plugins mentioned to be vulnerable: `inventory/aws_ec2.py`, `inventory/aws_rds.py`, `lookup/aws_account_attribute.py`, `lookup/aws_secret.py`, and `lookup/aws_ssm.py`

*   Red Hat, SUSE, and Debian (including LTS) have released patches for this vulnerability.

```
Root cause of vulnerability:
Improper handling of the no_log option in combination with the logging verbosity level. Some plugins using boto3 logged credentials at debug level and Ansible set the global log level to debug, causing exposure of credentials.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
Improper handling of the `no_log` option combined with the logging level for plugins utilizing boto3.

Impact of exploitation:
Disclosure of sensitive AWS credentials (or other potentially sensitive data) in Ansible log files.

Attack vectors:
Access to Ansible's log files and the ability to trigger the execution of a vulnerable ansible plugin.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
Access to Ansible log files and ability to trigger execution of playbooks or tasks with affected plugins. Ansible must be configured to log at least -v verbosity.
