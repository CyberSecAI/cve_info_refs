## [v2.7.14](#id41)

### [Release Summary](#id42)

Release Date: 2019-10-17
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id43)

* ansible-test defaults to redacting sensitive values (disable with the `--no-redact` option)

### [Bugfixes](#id44)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14846 - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials in log files. inventory/aws\_ec2.py, inventory/aws\_rds.py, lookup/aws\_account\_attribute.py, and lookup/aws\_secret.py, lookup/aws\_ssm.py use the boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level DEBUG. If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG\_PATH to a value) Ansible would set the global log level to DEBUG. This was inherited by boto and would then log boto credentials to the file specified by LOG\_PATH. This did not affect aws ansible modules as those are executed in a separate process. This has been fixed by switching to log level INFO
* **security issue** - Convert CLI provided passwords to text initially, to prevent unsafe context being lost when converting from bytes->text during post processing of PlayContext. This prevents CLI provided passwords from being incorrectly templated (CVE-2019-14856)
* **security issue** - properly hide parameters marked with `no_log` in suboptions when invalid parameters are passed to the module (CVE-2019-14858)
* ACI modules - Fix a whitespace issue in filters for ACI 4.2 strict validation

## [v2.7.13](#id45)

### [Release Summary](#id46)

Release Date: 2019-08-15
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Bugfixes](#id47)

* resolves CVE-2019-10206, by avoiding templating passwords from prompt as it is probable they have special characters.

## [v2.7.12](#id48)

### [Release Summary](#id49)

Release Date: 2019-07-03
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Bugfixes](#id50)

* Handle improper variable substitution that was happening in safe\_eval, it was always meant to just do 'type enforcement' and have Jinja2 deal with all variable interpolation. Also see CVE-2019-10156

## [v2.7.11](#id51)

### [Release Summary](#id52)

Release Date: 2019-05-23
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Bugfixes](#id53)

* Add missing parameters in get\_config vyos ([#50855](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50855)).
* Fix defaults option in the nxos\_config module ([#51076](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/51076)).
* Fix netconf plugin dispatch response ([#53236](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/53236))
* Fix nxos action plugin for nxos\_install\_os ([#53768](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/53768)).
* Fix privilege escalation support for the docker connection plugin when credentials need to be supplied (e.g. sudo with password).
* Fix regular expression for timeout ([#53994](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/53994)).

## [v2.7.0](#id95)

### [Release Summary](#id96)

Release Date: 2018-10-04
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Major Changes](#id97)

* Allow config to enable native jinja types ([#32738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/32738))
* Extends module\_defaults by adding a prefix to defaults group/ which denotes a builtin or user-specified list of modules, such as group/aws or group/gcp
* New keyword ignore\_unreachable for plays and blocks. Allows ignoring tasks that fail due to unreachable hosts, and check results with is unreachable test.
* New yumdnf module defines the shared argument specification for both yum and dnf modules and provides an entry point to share code when applicable
* Remove support for simplejson ([#42761](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42761))
* Support for running an Ansible controller with Python-2.6 has been dropped. You can still manage machines which use Python-2.6 but you will have to manage them from a machine which has Python-2.7 or Python-3.5 or greater installed. See the [porting guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides/porting_guide_2.7.html) if you need more information.
* new yum action plugin enables the yum module to work with both yum3 and dnf-based yum4 by detecting the backend package manager and routing commands through the correct Ansible module for that python API
* yum and dnf modules now at feature parity

### [Minor Changes](#id98)

* ActionBase - removed deprecated \_fixup\_perms method ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))
* Add is\_boto3\_error\_code function to module\_utils/aws/core.py to make it easier for modules to handle special AWS error codes.
* Add use\_backend to yum module/action plugin
* Added PrivilegeUtil PowerShell module util to easily control Windows Privileges in a process
* Added capability to skip ssl verification on zabbix host with dynamic inventory
* Added inventory.any\_unparsed\_is\_failed configuration setting. In an inventory with a static hosts file and (say) ec2.py, enabling this setting will cause a failure instead of a warning if ec2.py fails.
* Added new filter to generate random MAC addresses from a given string acting as a prefix. Refer to the appropriate entry which has been added to user\_guide playbook\_filters.rst document.
* Added the from\_yaml\_all filter to parse multi-document yaml strings. Refer to the appropriate entry which as been added to user\_guide playbooks\_filters.rst document.
* Ansible-2.7 changes the Ansiballz strategy for running modules remotely so that invoking a module only needs to invoke python once per module on the remote machine instead of twice.
* Better error handling for depsolve and transaction errors in DNF
* Changed the prefix of all Vultr modules from vr to vultr ([#42942](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42942)).
* Enable installroot tests for yum4(dnf) integration testing, dnf backend now supports that
* Explicit encoding for the output of the template module, to be able to generate non-utf8 files from a utf-8 template. ([ansible/proposals#121](https://github.com/ansible/proposals/issues/121))
* File locking feature added, making it possible to gain exclusive access to given file through module\_utils.common.file.FileLock ([#29962](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/29962))
* Fix dnf handling of autoremove to be compatible with yum
* Fix timer in exponential backoff algorithm in vmware.py.
* Fixed group action idempotent transactions in dnf backend
* Fixed group actions in check mode to report correct changed state
* GCP Modules will do home path expansion on service account file paths
* In Ansible-2.4 and above, Ansible passes the temporary directory a module should use to the module. This is done via a module parameter (\_ansible\_tmpdir). An earlier version of this which was also prototyped in Ansible-2.4 development used an environment variable, ANSIBLE\_REMOTE\_TMP to pass this information to the module instead. When we switched to using a module parameter, the environment variable was left in by mistake. Ansible-2.7 removes that variable. Any third party modules which relied on it should use the module parameter instead.
* New config options display\_ok\_hosts and display\_failed\_stderr (along with the existing display\_skipped\_hosts option) allow more fine-grained control over the way that ansible displays output from a playbook ([#41058](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41058))
* Removed an unnecessary import from the AnsiballZ wrapper
* Restore module\_utils.basic.BOOLEANS variable for backwards compatibility with the module API in older ansible releases.
* Setting file attributes (via the file module amongst others) now accepts + and - modifiers to add or remove individual attributes. ([#33838](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/33838))
* Switch from zip to bc for certain package install/remove test cases in yum integration tests. The dnf depsolver downgrades python when you uninstall zip which alters the test environment and we have no control over that.
* The acme\_account and acme\_certificate modules now support two backends: the Python cryptograpy module or the OpenSSL binary. By default, the modules detect if a new enough cryptography module is available and use it, with the OpenSSL binary being a fallback. If the detection fails for some reason, the OpenSSL binary backend can be explicitly selected by setting select\_crypto\_backend to openssl.
* The apt, ec2\_elb\_lb, elb\_classic\_lb, and unarchive modules have been ported away from using \_\_file\_\_. This is futureproofing as\_\_file\_\_ won't work if we switch to using python -m to invoke modules in the future or if we figure out a way to make a module never touch disk for pipelining purposes.
* The password\_hash filter supports all parameters of passlib. This allows users to provide a rounds parameter. ([#15326](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/15326))
* action plugins strictly accept valid parameters and report invalid parameters
* allow user to customize default ansible-console prompt/msg default color
* aws\_caller\_facts - The module now outputs the "account\_alias" as well
* aws\_rds - Add new inventory plugin for RDS instances and clusters to match behavior in the ec2 inventory script.
* command module - Add support for check mode when passing creates or removes arguments. ([#40428](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40428))
* dnf - group removal does not work if group was installed with Ansible because of dnf upstream bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1620324>
* ec2\_group - Add diff mode support with and without check mode. This feature is preview and may change when a common framework is adopted for AWS modules.
* elasticsearch\_plugin - Add the possibility to use the elasticsearch\_plugin installation batch mode to install plugins with advanced privileges without user interaction.
* gather\_subset - removed deprecated functionality for using comma separated list with gather\_subset ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))
* get\_url - implement [expend checksum format to <algorithm>:(<checksum>|<url>)] ([#27617](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/27617))
* import\_tasks - Do not allow import\_tasks to transition to dynamic if the file is missing ([#44822](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/44822))
* lineinfile - add warning when using an empty regexp ([#29443](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/29443))
* onepassword/onepassword\_raw - accept subdomain and vault\_password to allow Ansible to unlock 1Password vaults
* password\_hash is not restricted to the subset provided by crypt.crypt ([#17266](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/17266))
* passwordstore - Add backup option when overwriting password (off by default)
* puppet - Add support for --debug, --verbose, --summarize [#37986](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/37986)

* roles - removed deprecated functionality for non YAML role specs ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))
* roles - removed deprecated special casing functionality of connection, port, and remote\_user for role params ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))
* service - removed deprecated state=running ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))
* shell module - Add support for check mode when passing creates or removes arguments. ([#40428](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40428))
* sns\_topic - Port sns\_topic module to boto3 and add an integration test suite.
* ssh - reset connection will show a warning instead of failing for older OpenSSH versions
* to\_nice\_json - specify separators to json.dumps to normalize the output between python2 and python3 ([#42633](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42633))
* user - backup shadow file on platforms where the module modifies it directly ([#40696](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/40696))
* user module - add a sanity check for the user's password and a more helpful warning message ([#43615](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/43615))
* vars\_prompt - removed deprecated functionality supporting 'short form' for vars\_prompt ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))
* vault - removed deprecated functionality for insecure VaultAES class ([#44320](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44320))

* win\_chocolatey - Add support for username and password on source feeds
* win\_chocolatey - Added ability to specify multiple packages as a list in 1 module invocation
* win\_chocolatey - Removed the need to manually escape double quotes in the proxy username and password
* win\_chocolatey - Will no longer upgrade Chocolatey in check mode
* win\_chocolatey - set the rc return value to always be returned, default to 0 [#41758](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41758)
* win\_disk\_image - return a list of mount paths with the return value `mount_paths`, this will always be a list and contain all mount points in an image
* win\_psexec - Added the `session` option to specify a session to start the process in
* winrm - change the \_reset() method to use reset() that is part of ConnectionBase

### [Deprecated Features](#id99)

* Modules will no longer be able to rely on the \_\_file\_\_ attribute pointing to a real file. If your third party module is using \_\_file\_\_ for something it should be changed before 2.8. See the 2.7 porting guide for more information.
* The skippy, full\_skip, actionable, and stderr callback plugins have been deprecated in favor of config options that influence the behavior of the default callback plugin ([#41058](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41058))
* win\_disk\_image - the return value `mount_path` is deprecated and will be removed in 2.11, this can be accessed through `mount_paths[0]` instead.

### [Removed Features (previously deprecated)](#id100)

* The configuration toggle, `merge_multiple_cli_tags`, has been removed. This setting controlled whether specifying `--tags` or `--skip-tags` multiple times on the commandline would merge the specified tags or use the old behaviour of overwriting the previous entry. The overwriting behaviour was deprecated in 2.3 and the default value of the config option became merge in 2.4.
* ec2\_facts - deprecated module removed ([#44536](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44536))
* s3 - deprecated module removed ([#44537](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44537))

### [Bugfixes](#id101)

* **Security Fix** - Some connection exceptions would cause no\_log specified on a task to be ignored. If this happened, the task information, including any private information could have been displayed to stdout and (if enabled, not the default) logged to a log file specified in ansible.cfg's log\_path. Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from ansible runs to a log file may have stored that private information onto disk that way as well. ([#41414](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41414))
* **Security Fix** - avoid loading host/group vars from cwd when not specifying a playbook or playbook base dir
* **Security Fix** - avoid using ansible.cfg in a world writable dir.
* Add ambiguous command check as the error message is not persistent on nexus devices ([#45337](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45337)).
* Add argspec to aws\_application\_scaling\_policy module to handle metric specifications, scaling cooldowns, and target values. [#45235](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45235)
* Additional checks ensure that there is always a result of hashing passwords in the password\_hash filter and vars\_prompt, otherwise an error is returned. Some modules (like user module) interprets None as no password at all, which can be dangerous if the password given above is passed directly into those modules.
* Allow arbitrary `log_driver` for docker\_container ([#33579](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/33579)).
* Avoids deprecated functionality of passlib with newer library versions.
* Changed the admin\_users config option to not include "admin" by default as admin is frequently used for a non-privileged account ([#41164](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41164))
* Fix alt linux detection/matching
* Fix an atomic\_move error that is 'true', but misleading. Now we show all 3 files involved and clarify what happened.
* Fix ec2\_group support for multi-account and peered VPC security groups. Reported in <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issue/44788> and fixed in [#45296](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45296)
* Fix ecs\_taskdefinition handling of changed role\_arn. If the task role in a ECS task definition changes ansible should create a new revsion of the task definition. [#45317](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45317)
* Fix glob path of rc.d Some distribtuions like SUSE has the rc%.d directories under /etc/init.d
* Fix health check parameter handling in elb\_target\_group per [#43244](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43244) about health\_check\_port. Fixed in [#45314](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45314)
* Fix lambda\_policy updates when principal is an account number. Backport of [#44871](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44871)
* Fix lxd module to be idempotent when the given configuration for the lxd container has not changed ([#38166](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38166))
* Fix python2.6 nothing to repeat nxos terminal plugin bug ([#45271](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45271)).
* Fix s3\_lifecycle module backwards compatibility without providing prefix. Blank prefixes regression was introduced in boto3 rewrite. [#45318](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45318)
* Fix terminal plugin regex nxos, iosxr ([#45135](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45135)).
* Fix the mount module's handling of swap entries in fstab ([#42837](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42837))
* Fixed an issue where `ansible_facts.pkg_mgr` would incorrectly set to `zypper` on Debian/Ubuntu systems that happened to have the command installed.
* Fixed runtime module to be able to handle syslog\_facility properly when python systemd module installed in a target system. ([#41078](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41078))
* Grafana dashboard module compatible with grafana 5 ([#41249](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41249))
* On Python2, loading config values from environment variables could lead to a traceback if there were nonascii characters present. Converted them to text strings so that no traceback will occur ([#43468](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/43468))
* Remove spurious changed=True returns when ec2\_group module is used with numeric ports. [#45240](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45240)
* Support key names that contain spaces in ec2\_metadata\_facts module. [#45313](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45313)
* The docker\_\* modules respect the DOCKER\_\* environment variables again ([#42641](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42641)).
* The fix for [CVE-2018-10875](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-10875) prints out a warning message about skipping a config file from a world writable current working directory. However, if the user explicitly specifies that the config file should be used via the ANSIBLE\_CONFIG environment variable then Ansible would honor that but still print out the warning message. This has been fixed so that Ansible honors the user's explicit wishes and does not print a warning message in that circumstance.
* The fix for [CVE-2018-10875](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-10875) prints out a warning message about skipping a config file from a world writable current working directory. However, if the user is in a world writable current working directory which does not contain a config file, it should not print a warning message. This release fixes that extaneous warning.
* The ssh connection plugin was categorizing all 255 exit statuses as an ssh error but modules can return exit code 255 as well. The connection plugin has now been changed to know that certain instances of exit code 255 are not ssh-related. ([#41716](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41716))
* allow custom endpoints to be used in the aws\_s3 module ([#36832](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36832))
* allow gathering env exception to work even when injection is off
* always correctly template no log for tasks [#43294](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43294)
* ansible-galaxy - properly list all roles in roles\_path ([#43010](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/43010))
* authorized\_key now have an option for following symlinks, default behaviour (False) can be changed by setting follow True/False
* basic.py - catch ValueError in case a FIPS enabled platform raises this exception - [#44447](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/44447)
* become runas - changed runas process so it does not create a temporary file on the disk during execution
* cloudfront\_distribution - replace call to nonexistent method 'validate\_distribution\_id\_from\_caller\_reference' with 'validate\_distribution\_from\_caller\_reference' and set the distribution\_id variable to the distribution's 'Id' key.
* corrected and clarified 'user' option deprecation in systemd module in favor of 'scope' option.
* delegate\_to - ensure if we get a non-Task object in \_get\_delegated\_vars, we return early ([#44934](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44934))
* docker\_container: fixing `working_dir` idempotency problem ([#42857](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42857))
* docker\_container: makes unit parsing for memory sizes more consistent, and fixes idempotency problem when `kernel_memory` is set (see [#16748](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/16748) and [#42692](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42692))
* ec2\_group - Sanitize the ingress and egress rules before operating on them by flattening any lists within lists describing the target CIDR(s) into a list of strings. Prior to Ansible 2.6 the ec2\_group module accepted a list of strings, a list of lists, or a combination of strings and lists within a list. [#45594](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45594)
* ec2\_vpc\_route\_table - check the origin before replacing routes. Routes with the origin 'EnableVgwRoutePropagation' may not be replaced.
* elasticsearch\_plugin - Improve error messages and show stderr of elasticsearch commands
* elb\_application\_lb - Fix a dangerous behavior of deleting an ELB if state was omitted from the task. Now state defaults to 'present', which is typical throughout AWS modules.
* elb\_target\_group - cast target ports to integers before making API calls after the key 'Targets' is in params.
* file module - The touch subcommand had its diff output broken during the 2.6.x development cycle. The patch to fix that broke check mode. This is now fixed ([#42111](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42111))
* file module - The touch subcommand had its diff output broken during the 2.6.x development cycle. This is now fixed ([#41755](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41755))
* fix async for the aws\_s3 module by adding async support to the action plugin ([#40826](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40826))
* fix azure storage blob cannot create blob container in non-public azure cloud environment. ([#35223](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35223))

* fix nxos\_facts indefinite hang for text based output ([#45845](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45845)).
* fix the enable\_snat parameter that is only supposed to be used by an user with the right policies. [#44418](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44418)
* fix the remote tmp folder permissions issue when becoming a non admin user - [#41340](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41340), [#42117](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/42117)
* fixed typo in config that prevented keys matching
* fixes docker\_container check and debug mode ([#42380](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42380))

* get\_url - support remote checksum files with paths specified with leading dots (./path/to/file)
* get\_url / uri - Use custom rfc2822 date format function instead of locale specific strftime ([#44857](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/44857))
* improved block docs
* improves docker\_container idempotency ([#44808](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44808))
* include - Change order of where the new block is inserted with apply so that apply args are not applied to the include also ([#44912](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/44912))

Package        : ansible
Version        : 1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u3
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14846 CVE-2020-1733 CVE-2020-1739 CVE-2020-1740
Debian Bug     : 942188

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment, and task execution system.

CVE-2019-14846

    Ansible was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure
    of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials
    at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as
    those are executed in a separate process.

CVE-2020-1733

    A race condition flaw was found when running a playbook with an
    unprivileged become user. When Ansible needs to run a module with
    become user, the temporary directory is created in /var/tmp. This
    directory is created with "umask 77 && mkdir -p dir"; this
    operation does not fail if the directory already exists and is
    owned by another user. An attacker could take advantage to gain
    control of the become user as the target directory can be
    retrieved by iterating '/proc/pid/cmdline'.

CVE-2020-1739

    A flaw was found when a password is set with the argument
    "password" of svn module, it is used on svn command line,
    disclosing to other users within the same node. An attacker could
    take advantage by reading the cmdline file from that particular
    PID on the procfs.

CVE-2020-1740

    A flaw was found when using Ansible Vault for editing encrypted
    files. When a user executes "ansible-vault edit", another user on
    the same computer can read the old and new secret, as it is
    created in a temporary file with mkstemp and the returned file
    descriptor is closed and the method write_data is called to write
    the existing secret in the file. This method will delete the file
    before recreating it insecurely.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.2+dfsg-2+deb8u3.

# CVE-2019-14846

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14844.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14847.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14846 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14846)

#### Description

In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.

# CVE-2019-14858

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14857.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14859.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14858 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14858)

#### Description

A vulnerability was found in Ansible engine 2.x up to 2.8 and Ansible tower 3.x up to 3.5. When a module has an argument\_spec with sub parameters marked as no\_log, passing an invalid parameter name to the module will cause the task to fail before the no\_log options in the sub parameters are processed. As a result, data in the sub parameter fields will not be masked and will be displayed if Ansible is run with increased verbosity and present in the module invocation arguments for the task.

Description:
This update for ansible to version 2.9.6 fixes the following issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2019-14904: Fixed a vulnerability in solaris\_zone module via crafted
solaris zone (boo#1157968).
- CVE-2019-14905: Fixed an issue where malicious code could craft filename
in nxos\_file\_copy module (boo#1157969).
- CVE-2019-14864: Fixed Splunk and Sumologic callback plugins leak
sensitive data in logs (boo#1154830).
- CVE-2019-14846: Fixed secrets disclosure on logs due to display is
hardcoded to DEBUG level (boo#1153452)
- CVE-2019-14856: Fixed insufficient fix for CVE-2019-10206 (boo#1154232)
- CVE-2019-14858: Fixed data in the sub parameter fields that will not be
masked and will be displayed when run with increased verbosity
(boo#1154231)
- CVE-2019-10206: ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools prompt
passwords by expanding them from templates as they could contain special
characters. Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and
exposing them. (boo#1142690)
- CVE-2019-10217: Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by
no\_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set
properly. service\_account\_contents() which is common class for all gcp
modules is not setting no\_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by
that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

                 CVE-2020-14365 CVE-2021-20228

Several vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration
management, deployment and task execution system, which could result in
information disclosure or argument injection. In addition a race
condition in become_user was fixed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.7+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

The fix in devel makes two changes which are independently sufficient to fix the problem.

Gluster uses Ansible package from Ansible repository and hence it will consume fixes from core Ansible. For Ceph-3 we still maintain Ansible atleast for Ubuntu, Ceph-2 is about to reach end of life in December 2019.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:01:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.7 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:3202 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3202](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3202)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:01:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:3201 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3201](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3201)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:06:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:3203 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3203](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3203)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 14:27:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:3207 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3207](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3207)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-10-25 00:51:24 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

…tials to logs

##### SUMMARY

[CVE-2019-14846](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-pm48-cvv2-29q5 "CVE-2019-14846") - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials

in log files. inventory/aws\_ec2.py, inventory/aws\_rds.py,

lookup/aws\_account\_attribute.py, and lookup/aws\_secret.py, lookup/aws\_ssm.py use the

boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level

DEBUG. If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG\_PATH to a value) Ansible would

set the global log level to DEBUG. This was inherited by boto and would then log boto

credentials to the file specified by LOG\_PATH. This did not affect aws ansible modules

as those are executed in a separate process. This has been fixed by switching to log

level INFO"

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : ansible
Version        : 2.2.1.0-2+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-7481 CVE-2019-10156 CVE-2019-14846
                 CVE-2019-14904
Debian Bug     : 862666 930065 942188

Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in ansible, a configuration
management, deployment, and task execution system.

CVE-2017-7481

    Ansible fails to properly mark lookup-plugin results as unsafe. If an
    attacker could control the results of lookup() calls, they could inject
    Unicode strings to be parsed by the jinja2 templating system, resulting in
    code execution. By default, the jinja2 templating language is now marked as
    'unsafe' and is not evaluated.

CVE-2019-10156

    A flaw was discovered in the way Ansible templating was implemented,
    causing the possibility of information disclosure through unexpected
    variable substitution. By taking advantage of unintended variable
    substitution the content of any variable may be disclosed.

CVE-2019-14846

    Ansible was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of
    credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG
    level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in
    a separate process.

CVE-2019-14904

    A flaw was found in the solaris_zone module from the Ansible Community
    modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone
    name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the
    remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting
    the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.2.1.0-2+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your ansible packages.

For the detailed security status of ansible please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ansible>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# Ansible 2.6 "Heartbreaker" Release Notes

## v2.6.20

### Release Summary

Release Date: 2019-10-17
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### Bugfixes

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14846 - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials in log files. inventory/aws\_ec2.py, inventory/aws\_rds.py, lookup/aws\_account\_attribute.py, and lookup/aws\_secret.py, lookup/aws\_ssm.py use the boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level DEBUG. If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG\_PATH to a value) Ansible would set the global log level to DEBUG. This was inherited by boto and would then log boto credentials to the file specified by LOG\_PATH. This did not affect aws ansible modules as those are executed in a separate process. This has been fixed by switching to log level INFO
* **security issue** - Convert CLI provided passwords to text initially, to prevent unsafe context being lost when converting from bytes->text during post processing of PlayContext. This prevents CLI provided passwords from being incorrectly templated (CVE-2019-14856)
* **security issue** - properly hide parameters marked with `no_log` in suboptions when invalid parameters are passed to the module (CVE-2019-14858)

* The patch fixing the regression of no longer preferring matching security groups in the same VPC [#45787](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45787) (which was also backported to 2.6) broke EC2-Classic accounts. [#46242](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/46242) removes the assumption that security groups must be in a VPC.

* ec2\_group - Sanitize the ingress and egress rules before operating on them by flattening any lists within lists describing the target CIDR(s) into a list of strings. Prior to Ansible 2.6 the ec2\_group module accepted a list of strings, a list of lists, or a combination of strings and lists within a list. [#45594](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45594)
* ec2\_group - There can be multiple security groups with the same name in different VPCs. Prior to 2.6 if a target group name was provided, the group matching the name and VPC had highest precedence. Restore this behavior by updated the dictionary with the groups matching the VPC last.

* mysql\_\*, proxysql\_\* - PyMySQL (a pure-Python MySQL driver) is now a preferred dependency also supporting Python 3.X.
* powershell - Fix issue where setting ANSIBLE\_KEEP\_REMOTE\_FILES fails when using Python 2.6 - [#45490](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/45490)

* The fix for [CVE-2018-10875](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2018-10875) prints out a warning message about skipping a config file from a world writable current working directory. However, if the user explicitly specifies that the config file should be used via the ANSIBLE\_CONFIG environment variable then Ansible would honor that but still print out the warning message. This has been fixed so that Ansible honors the user's explicit wishes and does not print a warning message in that circumstance.
* To fix the bug where existing host\_record was deleted when existing record name is used with different IP. ([#43235](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/43235))

## v2.6.0

### Release Summary

Release Date: 2018-06-28
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### Minor Changes

* Added an `encoding` option to the `b64encode` and `b64decode` filters to specify the encoding of the string that is base64 encoded.
* PowerShell modules that use Convert-ToSID in Ansible.ModuleUtils.SID.psm1 like win\_user\_right now accept an actual SID as an input string. This means any local or domain accounts that are named like a SID need to be prefixed with the domain, hostname, or . to ensure it converts to that accounts SID [#38502](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/38502)
* Raise AnsibleParserError which was missing previously
* The aws\_ses\_identity module supports check mode
* `postgresql_user` module changed `encrypted=yes` to be the default. This shouldn't break any current playbooks, the module will just store passwords hashed by default. This change was done because Postgres 10 dropped support for `UNENCRYPTED` passwords and because all versions since Postgres 7.2 support storing encrypted passwords.
* azure\_rm\_loadbalancer - add support for sku
* azure\_rm\_publicipaddress - add support for sku
* cloudflare\_dns module - Removed restriction from protocol to allow other protocols than tcp and udp to be specified.
* command module - Added argv option to allow command to be specified as a list vs. a string ([#19392](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/19392))
* gem - add ability to specify a custom directory for installing gems ([#38195](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38195))
* import/include - Cache task\_vars to speed up IncludedFile.process\_include\_results ([#39026](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39026))
* postgresql\_user module - Changed encrypted=yes to be the default. This shouldn't break any current playbooks, the module will just store passwords hashed by default. This change was done because Postgres 10 dropped support for UNENCRYPTED passwords and because all versions since Postgres 7.2 support storing encrypted passwords.
* vmware\_target\_canonical\_facts module - The target\_id parameter is an optional parameter.

### Deprecated Features

* nxos\_igmp\_interface module - The oif\_prefix and oif\_source properties are deprecated. Use the oif\_ps parameter with a dictionary of prefix and source to values instead.

### Removed Features (previously deprecated)

* removed the deprecated always\_run task option, please use `check_mode: no` instead
* win\_chocolatey - removed deprecated upgrade option and choco\_\* output return values
* win\_feature - removed deprecated reboot option
* win\_iis\_webapppool - removed the ability to supply attributes as a string in favour of a dictionary
* win\_package - removed deprecated name option
* win\_regedit - removed deprecated support for specifying HKCC as HCCC

### Bugfixes

* **Security Fix** - Some connection exceptions would cause no\_log specified on a task to be ignored. If this happened, the task information, including any private information could have been displayed to stdout and (if enabled, not the default) logged to a log file specified in ansible.cfg's log\_path. Additionally, sites which redirected stdout from ansible runs to a log file may have stored that private information onto disk that way as well. ([#41414](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41414))
* Changed the admin\_users config option to not include "admin" by default as admin is frequently used for a non-privileged account ([#41164](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41164))
* Changed the output to "text" for "show vrf" command as default "json" output format with respect to "eapi" transport was failing ([#41470](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41470))
* Document mode=preserve for both the copy and template module
* Fix added for Digital Ocean Volumes API change causing Ansible to recieve an unexpected value in the response. ([#41431](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41431))
* Fix an encoding issue when parsing the examples from a plugins' documentation
* Fix iosxr\_config module to handle route-policy, community-set, prefix-set, as-path-set and rd-set blocks. All these blocks are part of route-policy language of iosxr.
* Fix mode=preserve with remote\_src=True for the copy module
* Implement mode=preserve for the template module
* The yaml callback plugin now allows non-ascii characters to be displayed.
* Various grafana\_\* modules - Port away from the deprecated b64encodestring function to the b64encode function instead. [#38388](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38388)
* added missing 'raise' to exception definition [#41690](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41690)
* allow custom endpoints to be used in the aws\_s3 module ([#36832](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36832))
* allow set\_options to be called multiple times [#41913](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41913)
* ansible-doc - fixed traceback on missing plugins ([#41167](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41167))
* cast the device\_mapping volume size to an int in the ec2\_ami module ([#40938](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40938))
* copy - fixed copy to only follow symlinks for files in the non-recursive case
* copy module - The copy module was attempting to change the mode of files for remote\_src=True even if mode was not set as a parameter. This failed on filesystems which do not have permission bits ([#40099](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40099))
* copy module - fixed recursive copy with relative paths ([#40166](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40166))
* correct debug display for all cases [#41331](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41331)
* correctly check hostvars for vars term [#41819](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41819)
* correctly handle yaml inventory files when entries are null dicts [#41692](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41692)
* dynamic includes - Allow inheriting attributes from static parents ([#38827](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/38827))

* file module - Fix error when running a task which assures a symlink to a nonexistent file exists for the second and subsequent times ([#39558](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39558))
* file module - The file module allowed the user to specify src as a parameter when state was not link or hard. This is documented as only applying to state=link or state=hard but in previous Ansible, this could have an effect in rare cornercases. For instance, "ansible -m file -a 'state=directory path=/tmp src=/var/lib'" would create /tmp/lib. This has been disabled and a warning emitted (will change to an error in Ansible-2.10).
* file module - The touch subcommand had its diff output broken during the 2.6.x development cycle. This is now fixed ([#41755](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/41755))
* fix BotoCoreError exception handling
* fix apt-mark on debian6 ([#41530](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/41530))

* include\_role/import\_role - Fix parameter templating ([#36372](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36372))
* include\_role/import\_role - Use the computed role name for include\_role/import\_role so to diffentiate between names computed from host vars ([#39516](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/39516))
* include\_role/import\_role - improved performance and recursion depth ([#36470](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/36470))

* selinux - correct check mode behavior to report same changes as normal mode ([#40721](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40721))
* spwd - With python 3.6 spwd.getspnam returns PermissionError instead of KeyError if user does not have privileges ([#39472](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/39472))
* synchronize - Ensure the local connection created by synchronize uses \_remote\_is\_local=True, which causes ActionBase to build a local tmpdir ([#40833](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/40833))

## [v2.8.6](#id19)

### [Release Summary](#id20)

Release Date: 2019-10-17
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id21)

* ansible-test defaults to redacting sensitive values (disable with the `--no-redact` option)
* dnf - Properly handle idempotent transactions with package name wildcard globs ([#62809](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62809))

### [Bugfixes](#id22)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14846 - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials in log files. inventory/aws\_ec2.py, inventory/aws\_rds.py, lookup/aws\_account\_attribute.py, and lookup/aws\_secret.py, lookup/aws\_ssm.py use the boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level DEBUG. If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG\_PATH to a value) Ansible would set the global log level to DEBUG. This was inherited by boto and would then log boto credentials to the file specified by LOG\_PATH. This did not affect aws ansible modules as those are executed in a separate process. This has been fixed by switching to log level INFO
* **security issue** - Convert CLI provided passwords to text initially, to prevent unsafe context being lost when converting from bytes->text during post processing of PlayContext. This prevents CLI provided passwords from being incorrectly templated (CVE-2019-14856)
* **security issue** - properly hide parameters marked with `no_log` in suboptions when invalid parameters are passed to the module (CVE-2019-14858)
* ACI modules - Fix a whitespace issue in filters for ACI 4.2 strict validation
* ACME modules: fix bug in ACME v1 account update code
* ACME modules: support Buypass' ACME v1 endpoint
* Cloudengine module\_utils - the `set-id` (RPC-REPLY XML attribute) may change over the time althougth `set-id` is the identity of the next RPC packet.
* Cloudengine netconf plugin - add a dispatch RPC function,just return original RPC-REPLY, the function is used by `Cloudengine module_utils`.
* For package\_facts, correct information about apt being missing and fix missing attribute.
* ansible-podman connection plugin - Fix case when mount of podman container fails and files can't be copied to/from container. Also add error handling in case of failed podman commands. ([#57740](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/57740))
* ansible-test now updates SSH keys it generates with newer versions of ssh-keygen to function with Paramiko

## [v2.8.0](#id43)

### [Release Summary](#id44)

Release Date: 2019-05-16
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Major Changes](#id45)

* Experimental support for Ansible Collections and content namespacing - Ansible content can now be packaged in a collection and addressed via namespaces. This allows for easier sharing, distribution, and installation of bundled modules/roles/plugins, and consistent rules for accessing specific content via namespaces.
* Python interpreter discovery - The first time a Python module runs on a target, Ansible will attempt to discover the proper default Python interpreter to use for the target platform/version (instead of immediately defaulting to `/usr/bin/python`). You can override this behavior by setting `ansible_python_interpreter` or via config. (see [#50163](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50163))
* become - The deprecated CLI arguments for `--sudo`, `--sudo-user`, `--ask-sudo-pass`, `-su`, `--su-user`, and `--ask-su-pass` have been removed, in favor of the more generic `--become`, `--become-user`, `--become-method`, and `--ask-become-pass`.
* become - become functionality has been migrated to a plugin architecture, to allow customization of become functionality and 3rd party become methods ([#50991](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50991))

* Ansible.ModuleUtils.Privilege - moved C# code to it's own util called `Ansible.Privilege` and expanded the tests
* Catch all connection timeout related exceptions and raise AnsibleConnectionError instead
* Change the position to search os-release since clearlinux new versions are providing /etc/os-release too
* Changed output of tags dictionary in results to standard Ansible format
* Cleaned up module code to remove all calls to the deprecated get\_exception() function
* Connection plugins have been standardized to allow use of `ansible_<conn-type>_user` and `ansible_<conn-type>_password` variables. Variables such as `ansible_<conn-type>_pass` and `ansible_<conn-type>_username` are treated with lower priority than the standardized names and may be deprecated in the future. In general, the `ansible_user` and `ansible_password` vars should be used unless there is a reason to use the connection-specific variables.
* Display - Add a `Singleton` metaclass and apply it to `Display` to remove the need of using `__main__.Display` as a pseudo singleton
* Drop the use of pkg\_resources. Importing pkg\_resources was the costliest part of startup time for Ansible. pkg\_resources was used so that platforms with old versions of PyCrypto and Jinja2 could use parallel installed, updated versions. Since we no longer support Python-2.6 on the controller side, we no longer have to support parallel installation to work around those old stacks.
* Embed an overridable static sanitization method into base inventory plugin class to allow individual plugins to optionally override Add override implementation to inital set of cloud plugins
* Ensures 'elapsed' is always returned, when timed out or failed
* Fix API call to \_wait\_for\_response in k8s modules ([#53937](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/53937)).

* Improve the deprecation message for squashing, to not give misleading advice
* Increase the default persistent command\_timeout value from 10 to 30 seconds to reduce frequent timeout issues.
* Modules and plugins have been standardized on a well-defined set of TLS-related parameters. The old names remain as aliases for compatibility. In general, the new names will override the old names if both are specified. The standard names are: `client_cert` (certificate for client identity, might also include the private key), `client_key` (private key for `client_cert`), `ca_cert` (public key to validate server's identity, usually a root certificate), and `validate_certs` (boolean to enable or disable certificate validity checking).
* Moved the FactCache code from ansible.plugins.cache.FactCache to ansible.vars.fact\_cache.FactCache as it is not meant to be used to implement cache plugins.
* Now emits 'elapsed' as a return value for get\_url, uri and win\_uri
* On Solaris, the ansible\_product\_name fact is populated for a wider range of older hardware models, and ansible\_system\_vendor fact is populated for certain known vendors.
* Parsing plugin filter may raise TypeError, gracefully handle this exception and let user know about the syntax error in plugin filter file.
* Python-3.8 removes platform.dist() from the standard library. To maintain compatibility we've switched to an alternative library, nir0s/distro, to detect the distribution for fact gathering. Distributions facts may change slightly as nir0s/distro has bugfixes which the standard library's platform.dist() has lacked.
* Raise AnsibleConnectionError on winrm connection errors
* Refactored the CLI code to parse the CLI arguments and then save them into a non-mutatable global singleton. This should make it easier to modify.
* Removed the private `_options` attribute of `CallbackBase`. See the porting guide if you need access to the command line arguments in a callback plugin.
* Support for Cumulus Linux 2.5.4 and 3.7.3 added in setup facts ([#52309](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/52309)).

* cloudstack - The choice list for the param 'hypervisor' had been removed to allow the API to validate depending on your setup directly.
* cmdline fact parsing can return multiple values of a single key. Deprecate cmdline fact in favor of proc\_cmdline.
* command/shell - new stdin\_add\_newline arg allows suppression of automatically-added newline n character to the specified in the stdin arg.
* conn\_limit type is set to 'int' in postgresql\_user module. This will allow module to compare conn\_limit with record value without type casting.

* docker\_container - `stop_timeout` is now also used to set the `StopTimeout` property of the docker container when creating the container.
* docker\_container - a new option `networks_cli_compatible` with default value `no` has been added. The default value will change to `yes` in Ansible 2.12. Setting it to `yes` lets the module behave similar to `docker create --network` when at least one network is specified, i.e. the default network is not automatically attached to the container in this case.
* docker\_container - improved `diff` mode to show output.
* docker\_container - mount modes in `volumes` allow more values, similar to when using the `docker` executable.
* docker\_container - published\_ports now supports port ranges, IPv6 addresses, and no longer accepts hostnames, which were never used correctly anyway.
* docker\_container, docker\_network, docker\_volume - return facts as regular variables `container`, `network` respectively `volume` additionally to facts. This is now the preferred way to obtain results. The facts will be removed in Ansible 2.12.
* docker\_image - Add `build.cache_from` option.

* docker\_image - add option `build.use_proxy_config` to pass proxy config from the docker client configuration to the container while building.
* docker\_image - all build-related options have been moved into a suboption `build`. This affects the `dockerfile`, `http_timeout`, `nocache`, `path`, `pull`, `rm`, and `buildargs` options.
* docker\_image - set `changed` to `false` when using `force: yes` to load or build an image that ends up being identical to one already present on the Docker host.
* docker\_image - set `changed` to `false` when using `force: yes` to tag or push an image that ends up being identical to one already present on the Docker host or Docker registry.
* docker\_image - the `force` option has been deprecated; more specific options `force_source`, `force_absent` and `force_tag` have been added instead.
* docker\_image - the `source` option has been added to clarify the action performed by the module.

* docker\_network - improved `diff` mode to show output.
* docker\_secret - `data` can now accept Base64-encoded data via the new `data_is_b64` option. This allows to pass binary data or JSON data in unmodified form. ([#35119](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35119))
* docker\_service - return results as regular variable `services`; this is a dictionary mapping service names to container dictionaries. The old ansible facts are still returned, but it is recommended to use `register` and `services` in the future. The facts will be removed in Ansible 2.12.
* docker\_swarm - Added support for `default_addr_pool` and `subnet_size`.

Volumes are now only recreated if the parameters changed **and** `force` is set to `true` (instead of or). This is the behavior which has been described in the documentation all the time.
* docker\_volume - the `force` option has been deprecated, and a new option `recreate` has been added with default value `never`. If you use `force: yes` in a playbook, change it to `recreate: options-changed` instead.
* ecs\_service - adds support for service\_registries and scheduling\_strategies. desired\_count may now be none to support scheduling\_strategies

This distinction is necessary because escaping non-special chars such as
'(' or '{' turns them into special chars, the opposite of what is intended
by using regex\_escape on strings being passed as a Basic Regular
Expression.

* rename safeConfigParser to ConfigParser to suppress DeprecationWarning (The SafeConfigParser class has been renamed to ConfigParser in Python 3.2.)
* renamed dellemc\_idrac\_firmware module to idrac\_firmware
* retry\_files\_enabled now defaults to False instead of True.

* The internal key results in vmware\_guest\_snapshot module return renamed to snapshot\_results.
* The patch fixing the regression of no longer preferring matching security groups in the same VPC [#45787](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45787) (which was also backported to 2.6) broke EC2-Classic accounts.

* ec2 - Correctly sets the end date of the Spot Instance request. Sets ValidUntil value in proper way so it will be auto-canceled through spot\_wait\_timeout interval.
* ec2 - Only use user\_data if the user has specified a value. This prevents setting the instance's user data to b'None'.
* ec2 - if the private\_ip has been provided for the new network interface it shouldn't also be added to top level parameters for run\_instances()
* ec2\_asg - Fix error where ASG dict has no launch config or launch template key
* ec2\_asg - Fix scenario where min\_size can end up passing None type to boto
* ec2\_group - Sanitize the ingress and egress rules before operating on them by flattening any lists within lists describing the target CIDR(s) into a list of strings. Prior to Ansible 2.6 the ec2\_group module accepted a list of strings, a list of lists, or a combination of strings and lists within a list. [#45594](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/45594)
* ec2\_group - There can be multiple security groups with the same name in different VPCs. Prior to 2.6 if a target group name was provided, the group matching the name and VPC had highest precedence. Restore this behavior by updated the dictionary with the groups matching the VPC last.
* ec2\_instance - Correctly adds description when adding a single ENI to the instance

# CVE-2019-10217

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-10216.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-10218.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-10217 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10217)

#### Description

A flaw was found in ansible 2.8.0 before 2.8.4. Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by no\_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. service\_account\_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not setting no\_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-pm48-cvv2-29q5)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-pm48-cvv2-29q5/dependabot)

## Package

pip

ansible
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 0, < 2.6.20
>= 2.7.0a1, < 2.7.14
>= 2.8.0a1, < 2.8.6

## Patched versions

2.6.20
2.7.14
2.8.6

## Description

Ansible, all ansible\_engine-2.x versions and ansible\_engine-3.x up to ansible\_engine-3.5, was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
