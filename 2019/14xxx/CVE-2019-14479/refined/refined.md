The provided content relates to CVE-2019-14479.

Summary:
AdRem NetCrunch versions 10.6.0.4587 and 10.6.1.4607 are vulnerable to remote code execution. A read-only administrator can execute arbitrary code on the server running the NetCrunch server software.

Vulnerability Details:
- Root Cause: Improper input validation when testing "Startup Scripts" through the web client's RPC interface. Arbitrary code can be injected into the script's parameters.
- Weakness: The application fails to properly escape user input, allowing for command injection.
- Attack Vectors:
  - Via REST API (in version 10.6.0.4587): By sending a POST request to the `/ncsrv/dashboards/summary/rpc` endpoint.
  - Via WebSockets (in version 10.6.1.4607): By establishing a WebSocket connection and sending specific messages to create an "AppServerObject" and execute the request.
- Required Capabilities:
  - Authentication: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the NetCrunch web client.
  - Privilege: Even a read-only administrator account is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.
- Impact: Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the NetCrunch server with "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" privileges.
