- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Das Q software runs two servers on localhost (ports 27301 and 27302) without authentication and with a lax CORS policy, allowing requests from any origin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Lack of authentication on the local API servers.
    - Lax CORS policy that allows cross-origin requests from any website.
    - No anti-CSRF protection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the victim's computer by exploiting the /install endpoint and installing attacker-controlled zip files, along with the ability to view user plugin data, host information, and API keys.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Sending a cross-origin request to http://localhost:27302/install with an attacker-controlled `releaseUrl` from any website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker only needs to host a malicious web page that a victim visits while the Das Q application is running.
