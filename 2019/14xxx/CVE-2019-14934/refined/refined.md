```
{
  "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `pdf_load_pages_kids` function within `pdf.c`, where a certain size value is not properly validated.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Out-of-bounds write",
    "Memory corruption due to invalid size leading to malloc failure"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker could potentially trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) or possibly execute arbitrary code due to the out-of-bounds write.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing a specially crafted PDF file as input to the `pdfresurrect` tool.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious PDF file to the `pdfresurrect` tool."
