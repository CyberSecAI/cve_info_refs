- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure cookie handling on GitLab Pages. Authentication cookies were sent over HTTP without proper encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is related to the lack of proper encryption of authentication cookies.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability makes authentication cookies vulnerable to Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker could potentially intercept and steal the cookies.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attacks. The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and GitLab Pages.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned on the network path to intercept traffic between a user and GitLab Pages.
