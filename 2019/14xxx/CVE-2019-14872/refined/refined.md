{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `_dtoa_r` function in the newlib libc library performs multiple memory allocations without checking their return values. Specifically, functions like `d2b`, `Balloc` and `i2b` are used to allocate memory for big integers, but if these allocations fail and return NULL, subsequent operations on the returned pointer will result in a NULL pointer dereference.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Multiple NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities due to missing checks on return values from memory allocation functions (`malloc`, `Balloc`) within the `_dtoa_r` function.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A NULL pointer dereference will cause the processor to read/write bytes at offset 0x0 in memory. This could potentially leak interrupt handler addresses, overwrite interrupt handlers, or divert program execution to an installed interrupt handler by executing a function based on a pointer found there. In general, the device crashes.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerabilities are triggered when the `_dtoa_r` function is called under low-memory conditions, specifically when performing a string formatting operation that involves floating point numbers.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger string formatting functions (e.g., through user input) that involves floating point numbers. The target system has to be in low memory conditions."
