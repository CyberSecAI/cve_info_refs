Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-14700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue in the HTTPD web server of MicroDigital N-series cameras. Specifically, the `TZ` parameter is vulnerable to path traversal.
- When a request is sent with a crafted `TZ` parameter containing a file path, the server attempts to read and parse the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The webserver doesn't properly sanitize the `TZ` parameter allowing an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths within the system.
- **Unrestricted File Access:** The server attempts to read and parse the file specified in the `TZ` parameter without proper validation or access controls.
- **Denial of Service through /dev/random:** The server does not block access to `/dev/random`, making it possible to cause a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By specifying a path to a special file like `/dev/random`, an attacker can cause the server to stall or crash due to excessive resource consumption.
- **Information Disclosure:** While the content states that the attacker cannot retrieve the data that is read from the file, the vulnerability allows an attacker to determine the existence of files by observing the delay of server's response if it successfully reads the file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a crafted HTTP request to the camera's web server.
- **HTTP Request:** The attacker crafts an HTTP request that includes a `TZ` parameter containing a file path with directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device's web server (port 80).
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be carried out without any prior authentication to the webserver.
