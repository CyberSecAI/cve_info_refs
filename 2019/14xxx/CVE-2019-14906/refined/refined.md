{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in SDL while copying an existing surface into a new optimized one. This is caused by a lack of validation while loading a BMP image.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
      "Insufficient validation of input data"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially crash an application using SDL or achieve arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a crafted BMP image to an application that uses SDL for parsing untrusted input files.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide an application using SDL with a malicious BMP file to trigger the vulnerability."
