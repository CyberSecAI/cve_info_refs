Package        : libav
Version        : 6:11.12-1~deb8u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2017-9987 CVE-2018-5766 CVE-2018-11102 CVE-2019-14372
                 CVE-2019-14442

Several security issues have been corrected in multiple demuxers and
decoders of the libav multimedia library.

CVE-2017-9987

    In Libav, there was a heap-based buffer overflow in the function
    hpel_motion in mpegvideo_motion.c. A crafted input could have lead to
    a remote denial of service attack.

CVE-2018-5766

    In Libav there was an invalid memcpy in the av_packet_ref function of
    libavcodec/avpacket.c. Remote attackers could have leveraged this
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a
    crafted avi file.

CVE-2018-11102

    A read access violation in the mov_probe function in
    libavformat/mov.c allowed remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (application crash), as demonstrated by avconv.

CVE-2019-14372

    In Libav, there was an infinite loop in the function
    wv_read_block_header() in the file wvdec.c.

CVE-2019-14442

    In mpc8_read_header in libavformat/mpc8.c, an input file could have
    resulted in an avio_seek infinite loop and hang, with 100% CPU
    consumption. Attackers could have leveraged this vulnerability to
    cause a denial of service via a crafted file.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
6:11.12-1~deb8u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your libav packages.
