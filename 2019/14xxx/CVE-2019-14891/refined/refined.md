{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient isolation between workload and infra containers in cri-o pods. All pod-related processes were placed in the same memory cgroup.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of proper isolation between containers within a pod.",
       "Shared memory cgroup for all pod-related processes."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause the conmon process of the infra container to be killed by triggering an out-of-memory (OOM) condition in a workload container. This allows the attacker to gain host network access on a Kubernetes worker node.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation requires an attacker to have the ability to run a workload container within a Kubernetes pod on a node running cri-o.",
      "The attacker's container triggers an out-of-memory (OOM) condition, resulting in the kernel killing the infra container's conmon process."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to run a workload container on the vulnerable Kubernetes node and trigger an OOM condition. The attacker can achieve this by allocating excessive memory in their container."
