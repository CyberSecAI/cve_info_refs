Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-14523:

**Root Cause:**
- Integer underflow in the `fmt_okt_load_song` function of the Amiga Oktalyzer parser (`fmt/okt.c`).

**Weakness:**
- The parser reads the length of the song's order list (`plen`) directly from the file as a 2-byte value.
- It then calculates the size of a memory operation (memset) by subtracting `plen` from `MAX_ORDERS`.
- If `plen` is larger than `MAX_ORDERS` (256), the subtraction results in an integer underflow, leading to a very large unsigned integer.
- This large size is used in memset, resulting in a heap overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow, which can lead to denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious Amiga Oktalyzer file with a `plen` value larger than 256, an attacker could trigger the underflow and cause the overflow.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens the malicious file in the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create/modify a specially crafted Amiga Oktalyzer file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable version of Schism Tracker.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Schism Tracker versions up to and including 20190722.
- The fix was included in the 20190805 release of Schism Tracker.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Semmle Security Research Team.
- The vulnerability is related to how the parser handles the Song's orderlist in Amiga Oktalyzer files.
- CVSS v3 score is 7.8, rated as high with attack vector as local, complexity low, no privileges required, user interaction required.
- CVSS v2 score is 6.8, medium, attack vector network, complexity medium, no authentication.
