Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the fact that an authenticated user can manipulate their assigned role within the response header. Specifically, an attacker can intercept the response from the server and change their role from a lower privilege role (e.g. developer) to an admin role.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Authorization:** The system relies on a role provided in the HTTP response header for authorization decisions, rather than relying on server-side user session or database lookups. This is a critical flaw in the authorization model.
- **Lack of Integrity Protection:** The response header is not cryptographically signed or protected against tampering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges to that of an administrator.
- **Unauthorized Access:** This grants the attacker full control over the Business Central Console, and therefore potentially the RHDM system depending on the extent of administrator capabilities.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability Impact:** With admin access, attackers can likely access sensitive information, modify configurations or data, and potentially disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept the HTTP response. This could occur via:
    - Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack on the network.
    - By controlling a compromised endpoint that is used to access the vulnerable system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account and must be able to authenticate to the RHDM system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the RHDM server.
- **Response Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP response from the server before it reaches their browser/application.

**Additional Details:**

- The affected software is RHDM (Red Hat Decision Manager).
- The attacker exploits a flaw in the Business Central Console, where authorization decisions are improperly based on an easily manipulated role in the response header.
