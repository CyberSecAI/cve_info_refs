Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-14845:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way OpenShift builds handle source extraction from container images. Specifically, the TLS hostname verification is bypassed during this process.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**
- **TLS Hostname Verification Bypass:** The core issue is that the OpenShift builder does not properly verify the TLS hostname when extracting source code from a container image. This lack of validation creates an opportunity for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Content Injection:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to inject malicious content during the build process. By performing a man-in-the-middle attack, an attacker can intercept the communication and replace legitimate source code or container image layers with their own malicious versions. This can compromise the final built image and potentially the systems where it is deployed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** The attack vector involves a MitM attack. An attacker needs to be positioned between the OpenShift build process and the registry where the container image is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the OpenShift build process and the container image registry. This often implies the attacker being on the same network as the build system, or in a position to intercept traffic.
- **MitM Capabilities:** The attacker needs the capability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, which usually involves intercepting and potentially modifying network traffic.

**Additional Notes:**
- Red Hat has classified the severity of this vulnerability as **Moderate**.
- The vulnerability affects Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.1 and 4.2.
- The fix involves ensuring that TLS hostname verification is properly performed during source extraction from container images.
- The vulnerability was acknowledged by Miloslav Trmaƒç (Red Hat).
