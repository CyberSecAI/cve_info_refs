Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-14221:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2019-14221" and describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in "1CRM On-Premise Software" which aligns with the CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the mishandling of user-supplied input within the "Run Report" functionality of 1CRM On-Premise Software. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize or escape user-provided input that is later used to render web pages or reports. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code is persistently stored within the application's data (specifically within a report) and is executed when a victim views or runs the report.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The example provided shows how an attacker could use the injected code to steal the victim's cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.
*   **Defacement:** Attackers can potentially modify the appearance of the application's interface.
*   **Redirection:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Data Theft:** The injected JavaScript could be used to steal sensitive data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-Supplied Input:**  The vulnerability is triggered through user-supplied input within the report creation process.
*   **Report Creation:** An attacker crafts a report containing malicious code in a specific field.
*   **Report Execution:** When a victim views or runs the manipulated report, the malicious code is executed in their browser.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the 1CRM On-Premise Software to create a report.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs an understanding of the report creation process and the location of the vulnerability to inject malicious code.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs a victim user to view or run the malicious report in order to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The Proof of Concept (PoC) provided in the content illustrates the attack flow:
1.  The attacker logs into the application.
2.  The attacker navigates to the reporting functionality and creates a new report.
3.  The attacker adds a column to the report's layout and injects the malicious JavaScript code into the field.
4.  The attacker assigns the report to a victim user (e.g., an administrator).
5.  When the victim logs into the application, navigates to the reporting functionality and opens/runs the report, the attacker's malicious javascript is executed.
6.  The attacker can execute commands like `alert(document.cookie)` to steal session cookies, or redirect the victim.

The vulnerability was fixed in version 8.5.10.
