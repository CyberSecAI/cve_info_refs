{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Activity creation capabilities were not correctly respected when selecting the activity to use for a course in single activity mode.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect permission checks when creating a course in single activity format.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A user could bypass intended restrictions on activity creation when using a single activity format for a course. This could lead to users creating courses with activities they are not supposed to have access to, potentially gaining elevated privileges or access to sensitive information",
  "Attack vectors": "Creating a course in single activity mode and selecting an activity for which the user doesn't have the appropriate permissions.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to create courses and select activities for the course."
