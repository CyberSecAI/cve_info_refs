Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14763:

**Content Verification:**

The Ubuntu USN-4115-1 and USN-4118-1 notices, along with the kernel commit logs, directly mention CVE-2019-14763, confirming that the content is related to this CVE.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** A race condition exists in the DesignWare USB3 DRD Controller device driver within the Linux kernel. This race condition occurs in `f_hidg_write()`.

*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The core issue is a locking problem in the interaction between the `f_hidg_write()` function and the USB endpoint queuing mechanism. `f_hidg_write()` acquires a spinlock (`write_spinlock`), calls `usb_ep_queue()`, and this function, specifically when using a dummy HCD (host controller driver), can call back into `f_hidg_req_complete()` before `usb_ep_queue()` returns. The `f_hidg_req_complete()` function attempts to acquire the same spinlock, leading to a deadlock.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A physically proximate attacker can trigger this race condition causing a denial of service by system lockup. The vulnerability itself won't permit code execution, it will cause a system to become unresponsive and unusable.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is physical proximity, as it involves interacting with a USB device using the vulnerable driver. This suggests the attacker needs to be physically present and capable of using or manipulating a USB device which uses the vulnerable driver.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs physical access to the target system.
    *   The attacker would need to be able to interact with the DesignWare USB3 DRD Controller.
    *   No special privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**

The following information is from the provided content:

*   The deadlock occurs due to a spinlock (`write_spinlock`) being acquired before calling `usb_ep_queue()` and then re-acquired in a callback function triggered by the dummy HCD, resulting in a deadlock.
*   The code snippet provided in the analysis demonstrates the incorrect locking, and the suggested fix where the spinlock is released before `usb_ep_queue()` is called.
*   The patch in the commit log for dwc3 also indicates the issue and a fix to avoid calling ->complete() from within ->ep_queue().
*   Tuba Yavuz was reported as the discoverer of the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

The provided content indicates a more specific scenario than the official description might suggest. The deadlock seems to be triggered in specific situations, notably using dummy HCDs. This means systems using actual hardware controllers may be less susceptible.

**Summary of Changes**
The fix involves moving the unlocking of the `write_spinlock` before the call to `usb_ep_queue` inside of the `f_hidg_write()` function.
The fix in the dwc3 driver involved not calling `->complete()` inside of `->ep_queue()`.

**Mitigation**
The provided content provides links to patches and updates that fix the vulnerability. The issue is resolved in Ubuntu using the kernel versions mentioned in the USN notices.

In summary, CVE-2019-14763 is a denial of service vulnerability caused by a race condition within the DesignWare USB3 DRD Controller device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker can exploit this by interacting with a USB device. The fix requires releasing the spinlock before calling usb_ep_queue().
