{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the Description field when creating or editing dashboards.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected dashboards. This can lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code within the Description field when creating or editing a dashboard via the `/CommonDataHandlerReadOnly.ashx` endpoint using the `addDashboard` or `editDashboard` methods.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to create or edit dashboards within the application. This typically requires a valid user account with the necessary permissions. "
