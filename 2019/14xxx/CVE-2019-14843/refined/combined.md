| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1752980#c0)  Chess Hazlett    2019-09-17 17:32:11 UTC  ``` It was found that the Wildfly Security Manager, running under JDK 11 or 8, would authorize requests for any requester. This flaw could be used by a malicious app deployed on the app server to access unauthorized information and possibly conduct further attacks.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1752980#c3)  santaclaus    2019-09-30 06:24:23 UTC  ``` Hello,   I have a short question:  Does this security flaw imply an attacker could break into the wildfly server, or does it mean that an attacker could break into the underlying linux system? Is this lib secure to use, if you have it as a dependency only, but there is no wildfly running.  Thank you very much in advance!  Kind regards.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1752980#c4)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-07 17:19:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform  Via RHSA-2019:2974 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2974](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2974)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1752980#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-07 17:29:03 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.2 for RHEL 6   Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 7.2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:2973 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2973](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2973)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1752980#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-11-25 19:04:52 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
