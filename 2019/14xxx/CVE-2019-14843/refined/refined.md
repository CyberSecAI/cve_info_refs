Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Wildfly Security Manager, when running under JDK 11 or 8, incorrectly authorized requests, essentially allowing any requester to bypass security checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Authorization bypass: The security manager failed to properly validate the requester, leading to an authorization bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access: A malicious application deployed on the application server could gain access to sensitive information it should not have access to.
- Further attacks: The vulnerability could be a stepping stone for more extensive attacks on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious application deployment: An attacker would need to deploy a malicious application onto the vulnerable Wildfly application server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to deploy applications: The attacker needs the capability to deploy applications on the target Wildfly server.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability affects Wildfly Security Manager when running under JDK 11 or 8.
- Mitigation includes not using the vulnerable JDK versions.
- Patches are available via Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA)
