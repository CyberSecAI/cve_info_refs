Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-14424

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The CUx-Daemon addon for HomeMatic systems contains a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization in the `index.ccc` script. The `file` and `logfile` parameters allow an attacker to specify arbitrary file paths on the system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to include local files by manipulating the `file` and `logfile` parameters in the CUx-Daemon's `index.ccc` script. This allows access to sensitive system files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can read sensitive system files like `/etc/shadow`, potentially exposing user credentials and other critical information.
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation can provide attackers with information necessary to further compromise the system, making it a starting point for more complex attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting malicious HTTP GET requests with manipulated `file` or `logfile` parameters.
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector requires access to the CUx-Daemon web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the web interface of the HomeMatic CCU.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the HomeMatic device.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:** CUx-Daemon versions 1.11a until 2.2.0 on HomeMatic CCU firmware 2.35.16 to 2.45.6
- **Exploitation:** The provided `curl` commands demonstrate how to exploit the vulnerability by reading `/etc/shadow`.
- **Remediation:** The vulnerability was fixed in CUx-Daemon version 2.3.0. The recommended mitigation was either to disable the vulnerable versions or update to the patched version.
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 6.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N), indicating a medium severity vulnerability.
