- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Null pointer dereference in the FPGA kernel driver.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A null pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the Intel Quartus Prime Pro Edition FPGA kernel driver.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated local user can trigger a denial of service by exploiting the null pointer dereference.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated local user to trigger the vulnerability. The user interaction is required for successful exploitation.
