# Backdrop core - Moderately critical - Cross Site Scripting - SA-CORE-2019-010

Date: Wednesday, Aug 7th, 2019Advisory ID: BACKDROP-SA-CORE-2019-010Security risk: Moderately Critical
Vulnerability:
Cross Site Scripting

CVE ID:
[CVE-2019-14770](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14770)

Versions affected:

* Backdrop Core 1.13.x versions prior to 1.13.3
* Backdrop Core 1.12.x versions prior to 1.12.8
Description:

Some menu links within the administration bar may be crafted to execute JavaScript when the administrator is logged in and uses the search functionality.

This issue is mitigated by the attacker needing permissions to create administrative menu links, such as by creating a content type or layout. Such permissions are usually restricted to trusted or administrative users.

Solution:

Upgrade your site to the most recent version of Backdrop core. Download available on the [Backdrop CMS 1.13.3 release page](https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop/releases/tag/1.13.3). See the [update instructions](https://backdropcms.org/upgrade#from-previous-versions), if needed.
