Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed in the commits related to CVE-2019-14965:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The Jinja templating engine was not sufficiently restricted, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code through user-controlled input that would be processed by the template engine on the server.
*   **SQL Injection (SQLi):**  The application did not properly sanitize user-provided inputs used in SQL queries, particularly in `fields list`, `group_by`, and `order_by` clauses. This lack of sanitization could lead to SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Templating:** Jinja template engine allowed potentially harmful code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** Insufficient sanitization of user inputs before using them in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSTI:** Arbitrary code execution on the server leading to complete compromise of the server and data.
*   **SQLi:** Unauthorized access to the database, including modification or deletion of data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SSTI:** Exploiting template processing by providing malicious input to Jinja template engine.
*   **SQLi:** Manipulating query parameters such as `fields list`, `group_by`, or `order_by` to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SSTI:** Ability to provide inputs that are processed by the vulnerable Jinja template.
*   **SQLi:** Ability to influence parameters used in SQL queries.

**Technical Details:**

The commits included in the release v12.0.4 address the following:

*   **"fix(security): Make Jinja Tighter":** This commit focused on restricting the capabilities of the Jinja templating engine to prevent arbitrary code execution.
*   **"fix(security): Sanitize fields list, group_by and order_by clause to prevent SQLi":** This commit aimed to sanitize user-provided inputs used in SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
*   **"fix(search): Reduce restrictions on field contents":** This commit seems related to search functionality and how input is handled, possibly as a result of the changes made to prevent SQLi, but there's no clear indication of how it relates to the vulnerabilities mentioned above, other than that it was part of the same set of changes.

**Additional Notes:**

The provided content also mentions the fixes were backported to other versions (v10 and v11 hotfixes), indicating that these were not just an issue with version 12.  The pull requests #8044, #8045, #8046, and #8047 are all linked to this fix.
