Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-14951:

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the authentication process of the *Scout GPS Link* app. The app attempts to protect the LAN interface on port 7050 by using access code authentication and SSL/TLS encryption. However, a design flaw in the hash comparison allows an attacker to bypass the security mechanism.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Bypassed Authentication:** The application compares *h2* and *h4* for authentication, where h4 is derived from *AC*, salt2 and round2. The vulnerability arises from the fact that an attacker can effectively bypass this mechanism by comparing the values that go into generating these hashes directly.
    *   **Lack of Access Control:** The app allows connections from any source on the LAN interface (port 7050) and cellular networks.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Control:** By bypassing the authentication, an attacker can remotely control the *Scout GPS Link* app.
    *   **Arbitrary App Behavior:** Using the MQTT protocol, the attacker can publish messages to different topics, potentially leading to actions like the app quitting automatically.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network Scanning:** Attackers can scan for devices running the vulnerable app by searching for port 7050 on the local network or potentially over a cellular network.
    *   **Access Code Cracking:** The attacker can crack the access code by exploiting the described bypass during the authentication.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network (Wi-Fi or cellular) as the victim's device to discover the service running on port 7050.
    *   **Ability to Analyze Traffic:** The attacker needs to understand the protocol used by the application to exploit the bypass and send appropriate MQTT messages to control the app.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability is in the *Scout GPS Link* iOS application which is used to connect to vehicle multimedia systems.
*   The application uses the MQTT protocol for communication between the app and the car multimedia screen.
*   The access code is calculated using hash functions where a design flaw allows bypassing the intended security mechanism.
*   The document provides specific details such as hash values, salts and topics used in the MQTT protocol.
