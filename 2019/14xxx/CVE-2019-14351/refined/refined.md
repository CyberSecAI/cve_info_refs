Based on the provided content, here's an analysis regarding CVE-2019-14351:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The EspoCRM 5.6.4 API allows filtering of users based on the `password` attribute using a `startsWith` condition. This enables an attacker to iteratively probe for the user's password hash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **Password hash enumeration:** The API exposes a filter that allows an attacker to probe for the presence of a specific string at the beginning of a user's password hash.
* **Insecure API filtering:** Filtering on sensitive data like password hashes using `startsWith` allows for brute-force-style enumeration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Password hash disclosure:** A malicious authenticated attacker can discover the password hash of a user.
*  **Brute-force attacks:** Knowledge of a user's password hash enables the attacker to brute-force the actual password.
* **Account compromise:** Once the password is known, the attacker can compromise user accounts and gain unauthorized access to the system.

**Attack vectors:**
* **HTTP API request:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `/api/v1/User` endpoint with a specific `where` filter to test the password hash.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to perform the API request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the EspoCRM system.
*   **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to send HTTP requests to the EspoCRM server.

**Additional details:**
* The Proof of Concept (PoC) provided in the issue details the attack vector.
* The issue explicitly mentions that an attacker can "bruteforce user password hash by 1 symbol at a time using specially crafted filters."
