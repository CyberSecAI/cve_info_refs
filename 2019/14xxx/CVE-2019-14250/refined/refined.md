  "CVE-2019-14250": {
    "Additional Information": "The provided content contains multiple sources related to CVE-2019-14250. The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the simple_object_elf_match function of the libiberty library in GNU Binutils, caused by a missing check for a zero shstrndx value in an ELF file header, resulting in an integer overflow. The content includes a patch for the issue, SUSE security advisories and fixed package versions for various products.",
    "Root cause": "The `simple_object_elf_match` function in `simple-object-elf.c` in GNU libiberty does not validate the `shstrndx` value in an ELF header. Specifically, it fails to check if `e_shstrndx` is zero. This leads to an integer overflow when the offset to the string table is calculated using `(eor->shstrndx - 1)`. When `eor->shstrndx` is zero, the result becomes -1 which, as an unsigned integer, becomes a very large value that cause an out-of-bounds read and write of memory.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "The integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow which can be exploited to cause a denial of service (application crash) and potentially allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. This is achieved by providing a crafted ELF file with the `e_shstrndx` set to zero to software that uses affected versions of binutils.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted ELF file. An attacker needs to supply the vulnerable software with such a file.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted ELF file to the vulnerable software. This could be achieved by an attacker tricking a user into processing a malicious file, or through a service that automatically processes ELF files."

    "CVE-2019-17450": {
        "Additional Information": "The provided content contains multiple sources related to CVE-2019-17450. The vulnerability is an infinite recursion in the find_abstract_instance function in dwarf2.c in libbfd, leading to a denial of service. The content includes SUSE security advisories and fixed package versions for various products.",
    "Root cause": "The `find_abstract_instance` function in `dwarf2.c` in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, specifically in GNU Binutils, lacks proper handling of certain malformed or crafted ELF files. Specifically,  when processing certain DWARF information within the file, the function can enter an infinite recursive loop.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite recursion"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (application crash) by providing a specially-crafted ELF file that triggers the infinite recursion in the `find_abstract_instance` function. This can be triggered by tools such as `readelf`.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted ELF file. An attacker needs to supply the vulnerable software with such a file.",

     "Additional Information": "The provided content contains multiple sources related to CVE-2019-15847. This vulnerability exists in the POWER9 backend of GCC. It could result in a reduction in the entropy of the random number generator. The content includes SUSE security advisories and fixed package versions for various products.",
    "Root cause": "The POWER9 backend of GCC was found to have a flaw where it could optimize multiple calls to the `__builtin_darn` intrinsic function, which is intended to provide random numbers. Specifically, the compiler was optimizing multiple calls to a single call, thus reducing the output's entropy since it is no longer generating a unique random number with each call.",
        "Weaknesses": [
          "Insufficient entropy in random number generation"
        ],
        "Impact": "The vulnerability results in a reduced amount of entropy provided by the random number generator, potentially leading to weak or predictable random numbers. In certain cases, predictable random numbers could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.",
        "Attack vectors": "This is not directly exploitable by an attacker without specific use cases.",
        "Required capabilities": "No attacker capabilities needed to trigger vulnerability."

The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer over-read in the _bfd_doprnt function of the libbfd library in GNU Binutils. The content includes SUSE security advisories and fixed package versions for various products.",
        "Root cause": "The `_bfd_doprnt` function in `bfd.c` in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library, as distributed in GNU Binutils, mishandles an `e_shstrndx` section of type `SHT_GROUP` by omitting a trailing '\\0' character, resulting in a heap-based buffer over-read when processing malformed ELF files.",
