Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14495:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the 'admin' configuration saving functionality of 3proxy. Specifically, this occurs when processing the 'conffile' parameter within the web administration interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds write:** The code does not properly validate the length of the data received when updating the configuration file via the web interface, leading to a potential buffer overflow.
- **Incorrect content length handling:** The `contentlen` variable, read from the `Content-Length` header, was not appropriately checked against buffer limits, specifically, when receiving configuration data through a POST request with `enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded"`.
- **Inconsistent variable types**: Using `int` for `contentlen` when it should be `unsigned int`.
- **Missing validation**: The code does not validate if `contentlen` is non-zero before using it.
- **Improper URL decoding**: The code performs URL decoding which can be used to obfuscate the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could overwrite memory regions, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the web administration interface of 3proxy when modifying the configuration file.
- A malicious user can send a crafted HTTP POST request with a manipulated `Content-Length` header and `conffile` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the web administration interface. This usually requires knowledge of the administrative username and password, or exploitation of other vulnerabilities that could grant access to this interface.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the 3proxy server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves:
    -   Correcting the type of the `contentlen` variable to `unsigned int`.
    -   Adding checks to ensure content length is not zero before processing.
    -   Checking the received length of data against the maximum allowed buffer size.
    -   Checking if the received data starts with `conffile=` before proceeding.
