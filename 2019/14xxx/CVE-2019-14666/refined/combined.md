GLPI Vulnerability – Account takeover (CVE-2019-14666)

# GLPI Vulnerability – Account takeover (CVE-2019-14666)

01 - Jun - 2019

**Software**: GLPI

**Version**: <= 9.4.3
**Discovered by**: Pablo Martinez (@Xassiz)

**Fix**: version 9.4.4

## GLPI Vulnerability: Account takeover vulnerability (CVE-2019-14666)

### GLPI Vulnerability Description

We’ve found that it’s possible to abuse autocompletion feature to retrieve sensitive data from any user, using an unprivileged account.

Besides hashed session cookies or api keys in cleartext, a malicious user can retrieve the password\_forget\_token atributte which leads to account takeover when “Lost password” feature is enabled.

The steps are the following:

1. Choose a known email or get a list of them using autocompletion

GET /glpi/ajax/autocompletion.php?=UserEmail&field=email&term=

2. Get a list of all generated tokens

GET /glpi/ajax/autocompletion.php?=User&field=password\_forget\_token&term=

3. Invoke “Lost password” with target email

4. Get a list of all generated tokens again and compute the difference to get your freshly generated token

5. Set new password using /glpi/front/lostpassword.php?password\_forget\_token=[token]

To sum up: an unprivileged user could steal any account or escalate privileges by changing super-admin password. It’s also possible to steal admins’ api keys and use them with malicious purposes.

## [Existen distintas técnicas para realizar el análisis del firmware y extraer datos útiles](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-1.jpg)

Analyzing a firmware dump is not a simple task that can be summarized in simple steps to obtain a formula valid for all cases. Different techniques that can help extracting data from these dumps will be reviewed down below.

It is common during **firmware analysis** to be confronted with undocumented formats, proprietary solutions, and even encrypted data. For this reason, it is important not to lose the context in which the analysis is performed and to consider all the information gathered in the previous steps. With this context in mind, it will be possible to make a judicious choice between the various tools and techniques here proposed for **analyzing firmware**.

Next, it is proposed to transform the available **firmware dump** format into a **standardized binary** format for further analysis. A section is also dedicated to those cases in which our firmware may include more data than desired, which may alter the results of subsequent tests. Finally, metrics, tools and techniques that allow us to identify sections, formats and signatures within a firmware for later extraction are listed.

## Obtaining a raw binary dump

Depending on the techniques used in step two ([OWASP FSTM, stage 2: Obtaining IOT device firmware](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/owasp-fstm-obtaining-iot-device-firmware/)) of this guide, the **firmware dump** may be in different formats. The goal of this section is to convert that format into a raw binary format.

Many of the **analysis tools** available, will be based on binary formats and obtaining a binary is an important task in case at some point you want to perform a full emulation of the device.

In this first step, it relies on previous information to know in which format the **firmware dump** has been performed. The researcher must consult the documentation of the tool used to be sure to **perform a conversion to binary format**.

However, a text editor and hexadecimal editor should be sufficient to verify the information of the tools used or to find out in which format a dump can be found. The following is a summary of the most common formats for this type of task and their typical characteristics.

### Intel HEX

Being one of the oldest formats for representing the contents of memories, it can be characterized by its line start code, the colon ‘:’. Although the format is more complex, for simple cases it can be summarized in that for each line it usually includes the start code, a record length, the record address, a record type (data, usually) and a final checksum. More details on the format can be found [at the following link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_HEX). To **obtain a binary from such a file**, multiple tools can be used such as [Intel\_Hex2Bin](https://hex2bin.sourceforge.net/), or [SRecord](https://srecord.sourceforge.net/).

>
> :00000001FF

### SREC or Motorola S-Record

This format is like Intel HEX. Again, a start code is defined along with different fields to describe **data records in hexadecimal format**. It can be distinguished because in this case the start code is an ‘S’. More information can be found [at this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SREC_%28file_format%29). To convert this format to binary, the same tools can be used as in the previous section.

### Hexdump or hexadecimal string

As discussed in the article [OWASP FSTM, stage 2: Obtaining IOT device firmware](https://www.tarlogic.com/blog/owasp-fstm-obtaining-iot-device-firmware/), sometimes you will have access to devices through text interfaces and with limited tools. One of the most common options in this case for **memory dump is hexdump** or one of its alternatives. Normally a hexdump with these tools consists of an address column, a column with the memory contents in hexadecimal and finally an optional column with the contents encoded in text. To restore this format to a raw binary one of the most common tools is **xxd** with the ‘ – r’ parameter of revert. For more information about the format see [the following link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump).

### Base64

As with **hexdump**, base64 is a useful format for **transmitting an encoded binary over a channel** that only supports printable characters. Although it is less common to find a utility to generate the base64 of a file, many modern languages include libraries to do so.

If an embedded device is found without a command line utility for base64, it is common to be able to encode from Python, Perl or other languages on the device. Base64 defines a table that allows to transform between a binary value and a map defined for this encoding. The advantage is that this table of values, instead of being of 16 symbols (hexadecimal) is of 64, allowing to contain much more information for each character transmitted, **saving a lot of bandwidth in communications very limited in speed**. Because this encoding includes more than one byte per symbol, it sometimes requires a final padding that is done with the character ‘=’, very characteristic of this representation. To learn more about this encoding, see [the following link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64).

## Out-of-band and parity data screening

Once you have a binary file it is time to **remove the out-of-band and parity data** to get only the exclusively useful portion of the memory.

The out-of-band data in flash memory is used to store an index of memory blocks that are in bad condition to avoid their use. A bit pool for parity calculation is also usually included in this section so that there is a **mechanism for detecting faults and correcting the bits** that may have caused the error.

This step is only relevant after a memory dump using **“chip-off” techniques**, which consist of the **physical extraction of the memory**, since, in these cases, all its contents are extracted, including sections used as redundancy to improve the integrity of the stored data.

The example case is a NAND Flash memory dump.

[![Chip-off techniques consist of the physical extraction of the memory](data:image/gif;base64...)![Chip-off techniques consist of the physical extraction of the memory](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-2-en.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-2-en.jpg)

Source: [Micron](https://www.micron.com/-/media/client/global/documents/products/data-sheet/nand-flash/20-series/2gb_nand_m29b.pdf)

As can be seen in the image above, taken from the datasheet of a Micron NAND Flash memory, this memory is organized in blocks. Each of the 2,048 blocks has a set of 64 pages. According to the image, for this memory, each page is 1,024+32 words wide. When the user accesses the memory, he perceives that each page occupies a total of 1,024 words, although in the memory structure there are 32 additional words that serve for memory error correction.

This example structure is quite common, although each manufacturer may choose varied sizes for these redundancy structures or even other arrangements where the redundant memory is in blocks at the end of the memory instead of being interleaved within each block or page.

For the analysis and elimination of redundant data in a dump there are solutions that attempt to automate the process such as <https://github.com/Hitsxx/NandTool>, although sometimes a manual analysis will have to be performed by **studying the entropy of the file** and even autocorrelation techniques.

Once a file has been obtained in binary format without redundancy or “out of bands” data, the process of **analyzing the firmware contents** begins.

## Entropy analysis

**Computational entropy** is a concept from information theory, developed by C. E. Shannon, which attempts to obtain a measure of the uncertainty of the possible values that a random variable can take. For a data set of indeterminate origin and format, this concept has been reinterpreted to try to obtain a measure of the randomness of the values it contains.

Because of the change of context in which the concept of entropy is applied, the results of the calculation for a data set of indeterminate structure are closer to a measure of how much the bytes in the sample vary.

Based on this definition, the utility of the concept in the study of a **firmware image** is shown below.

[![empty firmware analysis](data:image/gif;base64...)![empty firmware analysis](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-3.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-3.jpg)

Using an (assumed) random generator, a 256-byte file is generated as shown in our image (all generated numbers are 0). Since there is no randomness in the values, the total entropy of the file is 0.

Using the second definition, it can be understood that, since there is no variation among the bytes, the entropy calculation is 0.

[![firmware entropy variation from 00 to FF](data:image/gif;base64...)![firmware entropy variation from 00 to FF](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-4.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-4.jpg)

If the programmer has “corrected” the random generator used in the previous example, another 256 bytes of information are dumped into a file, this time the result is that half of the file contains the value 00 and the other half contains the value FF. In this case, the file contains more “randomness” than in the previous case, so an increase in this measure is expected. To verify this, **binwalk** is run in entropy calculation mode and the result is higher than in the previous case, 0.125.

> % binwalk -E halfceros.bin
>
> DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL ENTROPY
>
> ——————————————————————————–
>
> 0 0x0 Falling entropy edge (0.125000)

It should be noted that some of these tools “normalize” the calculated entropy value. Some tools will give a value of 1 entropy point out of a maximum of 8, while others will show a value of 0.125 out of a maximum of 1.

It could also be said that the bytes in this file vary somewhat more from each other than in the previous case.

[![sequential entropy](data:image/gif;base64...)![sequential entropy](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-5.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-5.jpg)

Continuing with the previous example, if the random generator now writes all possible values of a byte sequentially in our file, the entropy is triggered to its maximum. If the information source is random, that information source can use all bytes so its “randomness” is high.

> % binwalk -E fullent.bin
>
> DECIMAL HEXADECIMAL ENTROPY
>
> ——————————————————————————–
>
> 0 0x0 Rising entropy edge (1.000000)

This is a clear example of taking entropy as an accurate measure of randomness is a mistake. In this case, the randomness of the content is low, and the next value could be predicted by simply adding one unit to the previous value. In this case, it should be understood is that the bytes have the maximum possible variation, as each one takes a different value from the previous ones.

A more mundane example of this could be given with our language. Taking as a symbol a word instead of a byte, if you analyze the entropy of a literary work, you will get an unknown entropy value X.

If in this same work all pronouns were removed, we would still be able to understand it in its entirety. The pronouns, while frequent, provide little information within the literary work. If we were now to perform a calculation of the entropy of the work without the pronouns, we would find a larger Y-measure than in the previous case (Y>X).

The example reveals that each word in the second work provides more information on average than in the first, even though in neither case has the choice of words been completely random.

To expand on this concept, we recommend reading the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28information_theory%29).

In the case of **firmware analysis**, entropy analysis can help **identify signatures and give clues to different data sources**.

Since the data being analyzed is not completely random, **entropy analysis** can be used to identify different origins of this data.

If the **entropy of the firmware file of our device** is calculated in moving windows, a continuous measure of the entropy of the file will be obtained and can be represented graphically. This plot can be continuous or have a high variance and this can tell us that the data being observed may come from different algorithms or have different uses.

To exemplify this, an analysis is performed on the OWASP “IoT Goat v1.0” image. This is a deliberately vulnerable image for the study of these techniques and can be found [at this link](https://github.com/OWASP/IoTGoat/tree/v1.0).

An **entropy calculation** is performed on this firmware image:

[![entropy analysis can help identify signatures and give clues to different data sources](data:image/gif;base64...)![entropy analysis can help identify signatures and give clues to different data sources](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-6-en-1024x281.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-6-en-1024x281.jpg)

From this image it can be extracted that there are possibly several sections with various uses in this firmware. There appears to be an initial section with no content followed by a section with high entropy. In the middle there are parts with various peaks that would need to be analyzed in more detail, but then there is another flat section with another level of entropy lower than the first. This could look like another file type, format, or firmware partition.

After this section is another turbulent and unclear area, followed by a large valley that seems to have no use and finally an area of very high entropy that is possibly a third section.

The points where these **entropy variations** occur are important study points. In them it is possible to find signatures of formats or algorithms used to generate them.

In addition to the information provided by the entropy variation, its value allows us to make assumptions about the state of the data.

In sections where high entropy values are found, it is due to the **use of data compression or encryption algorithms**. Compression processes generate the highest entropy values as they attempt to pack as much information as possible per byte, while encryption processes, which seek to maximize the randomness of the result, are usually just below compression. This may not be true for all compression and encryption algorithms.

## Signature identification

File formats and file systems use a series of bytes as identifiers, usually called “magic numbers” or signatures. During **firmware analysis** it is especially useful to identify signatures of known file types, for which multiple tools are available.

The most used automatic tool for **analyzing firmware** is **binwalk**. It has functions for identifying files in the firmware, both by searching for signatures and by detecting the coding of a section and looking for patterns. The basic use of **binwalk** is through the terminal:

The example shows that **binwalk** has detected text strings, references to system locations, executables in ELF format, data structures belonging to the AES encryption algorithm, images, CRC codes, device trees, compressed files, and file systems.

Despite the speed and simplicity of using **binwalk,** due to the type of analysis it performs, based on heuristics, false positives are frequent. It is always advisable to check manually, with a hexadecimal editor, the memory addresses that **binwalk** indicates in its results, especially if the results do not match previous findings.

A complementary tool to **binwalk** is **fdisk.** Especially when working with large files, **binwalk** can be slow. In addition, **fdisk** is a tool that allows us to identify partitions in a file. Partition detection is one of the best ways to split a firmware into smaller, more manageable files as will be described later.

**Fdisk** is a commonly used utility in Linux that allows the listing and manipulation of partition tables. If our firmware is partitioned it can be seen with this utility:

> $ fdisk -l IoTGoat-raspberry-pi2.img
>
> Disk IoTGoat-raspberry-pi2.img: 31.76 MiB, 33306112 bytes, 65051 sectors
>

>
> IoTGoat-raspberry-pi2.img2 57344 581631 524288 256M 83 Linux

Another utility that allows us to understand the contents of a firmware image is the **file** tool.

> $ file hola.txt
>
> hola.txt: ASCII text

To do this, **file** runs three types of tests on the file: searching for information with the stat system call, searching for signatures or “magic numbers” and language identification. The **stat** system call obtains information about a file available on the file system that contains it. On the other hand, **file** looks for signatures only in the first bytes of a file. Finally, **file** tries to find out if it is a text file and the encoding it uses, and then identifies whether it is a known formal language, such as XML, HTML, C or Java.

When the **file** command is applied to the IoT Goat test firmware, the results are consistent with those seen in **fdisk**:

> $ file IoTGoat-raspberry-pi2.img
>
> IoTGoat-raspberry-pi2.img: DOS/MBR boot sector; partition 1 : ID=0xc, active, start-CHS (0x20,2,3), end-CHS (0xc3,0,12), startsector 8192, 40960 sectors; partition 2 : ID=0x83, start-CHS (0xe3,2,15), end-CHS (0x14,0,16), startsector 57344, 524288 sectors

Here, **file** detects a DOS/MBR partition table with two partitions. In this case, **file** detects the signature at the beginning of the image and ignores the rest of the contents. Therefore, when encountering a result like the one above, it is advisable to inspect the file in more detail.

On the other hand, in other cases where the firmware has been extracted directly from the device memory, file may show a result like the following:

> $ file firmware.bin
>
> firmware.bin: data

This result indicates that **file** is not able to identify the file format, which is since it is a “binary” file (without a given structure) and the possible signatures and magic numbers it contains are not found at the beginning.

It is also possible to manually search for known file signatures by using a hexadecimal editor:

[![digital signature found when analysing the firmware](data:image/gif;base64...)![digital signature found when analysing the firmware](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-7.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-7.jpg)

A list of the most popular file signatures can be found [at this link](https://github.com/neilharvey/FileSignatures).

## Binary sectioning

Once a section of the firmware image has been identified, it can be analyzed as a separate file by extracting it with tools such as **dd**. The **dd** tool simply copies bytes from an input file to an output file. It is one of the classic tools on Linux systems and has many configuration options.

In some cases, the limits of a section will already have been found, but in others, it will be necessary to define where a file ends. To extract, for example, the ELF executable detected by **binwalk** at address 0x421000, it is first necessary to determine its size by reading the ELF header at the start address of the file.

**Binwalk** can do this sectioning and extract the data, but it does not always give satisfactory results, since for many formats it does not calculate total file sizes and simply makes a copy from a signature to the end of the firmware, obtaining better results if the job is done manually.

This sectioning process can be important to be able to split too large firmware into more manageable chunks for further processing or extraction.

## Byte distribution

Another analysis that can reveal what use a file may have been a histogram that represents the distribution of values in the file.

[![By profiling the byte distribution of a file, it is possible to recognize different file encodings](data:image/gif;base64...)![By profiling the byte distribution of a file, it is possible to recognize different file encodings](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-8-en-1024x277.jpg)](https://www.tarlogic.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/owasp-firmware-8-en-1024x277.jpg)

The histogram above shows a widespread use of bytes with values from 97 to 120. To a lesser extent there is also a use of bytes in the range 41 to 86. There is an isolated peak at value 32 and two smaller peaks at values 10 and 13.

This displayed profile matches the usable character distributions in the ASCII table. In particular, the peak at character 32 corresponds to the character representing a blank space, the statistically most used character in plain text.

By **profiling the byte distribution of a file**, it is possible to recognize different file encodings and even estimate the possible languages in which the text is written.

These same characterizations can occur in binary files or algorithms since, depending on their use, they show a bias in the distribution due to the diverse ways of encoding the information.

## String search

Although this is one of the most basic analysis that can be performed, listing the strings inside a file or firmware can provide a lot of information when performing an analysis.

In the case of binary files, **strings** can display debug messages, software licenses, version messages or even names of functions called from a binary. Knowing what software a binary may be running brings a lot of information to the context in which the analysis is being performed.

It is also common to find **strings** with compilation dates or firmware packaging, which can provide information on how up-to-date or outdated the firmware is.

> $ strings IoTGoat-raspberry-pi2.img
>
> …
>
> console=ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 rootwait
>
> …
>
> squashfs: version 4.0 (2009/01/31) Phillip Lougher

>
> DTOKLinux version 4.9.152 (embedos@embedos) (gcc version 7.3.0 (OpenWrt GCC 7.3.0 r7676-cddd7b4c77) ) #0 SMP Wed Jan 30 12:21:02 2019
>
> …

Sometimes the **strings** command may return too much information, so the ‘-n’ parameter is provided to set minimum lengths in the strings it returns.

## Search for other constants

Sometimes encrypted sections are identified using **entropy analysis, byte distribution** or other means. Once such a section is identified, there are not many options to discern whether that section is compressed or encrypted when no signatures are found in them.

In these cases, it is interesting to look for constants in these and other adjacent sections that can guide us in making this identification. Some **cryptographic algorithms** make use of constant structures to define their initial state. Others are commonly calculated based on tables.

It is common to find the initialization vectors of different **hashing algorithms** such as MD5, SHA1, SHA256… It is also common to find tables that implement the “Rijndael S-Box” or “AES S-Box” that indicate the use of the AES algorithm, or tables for the calculation of CRC codes, error detection and correction.

Having this information also helps to **perform manual analysis using hex editors**, as it indicates which integrity checking means have been used to build the firmware image. Thus, if an unknown field is found in a proprietary format and CRC algorithm signatures have been detected, it is interesting to check the most common CRC algorithms as an alternative for the contents of that field.

## Manual analysis with a hexadecimal editor

The **hex editor** is a fundamental tool for **analyzing firmware**. Although there are many tools available to automate this process, all or many of them rely on heuristics and will require manual supervision.

It is important to evaluate the multiple alternatives for this type of software to find one that the researcher is comfortable with as that investment of time will pay off in the short term.

Different alternatives offer different functionalities that can be especially useful: **support for placing markers in a file, structure recognition, entropy analysis, different search engines, CRC calculators, hashes**….

This tool is as important as the time spent using it. The investment of time doing these verifications manually can bring great benefits since the experience allows to recognize patterns that many of the automatic tools cannot sense; an important skill that allows to recognize small modifications on known algorithms as a means of obfuscation.

Due to the complexity of **analyzing firmware**, it is not easy to standardize a single procedure that is valid for all devices. Therefore, the workflow will need to be tailored to each device and will depend heavily on the device manufacturer.

In an analysis, the researcher will have to resort to many of these techniques at quite different times, prioritizing the experience and context acquired during the early stages of the analysis to really be effective in this task.

Experience and the ability to identify the points on which to focus attention at any given time will be important during this phase to conduct an effective analysis.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form.

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

GLPI Vulnerability – Account takeover (CVE-2019-14666)

# GLPI Vulnerability – Account takeover (CVE-2019-14666)

01 - Jun - 2019

**Software**: GLPI

**Version**: <= 9.4.3
**Discovered by**: Pablo Martinez (@Xassiz)

**Fix**: version 9.4.4

## GLPI Vulnerability: Account takeover vulnerability (CVE-2019-14666)

### GLPI Vulnerability Description

We’ve found that it’s possible to abuse autocompletion feature to retrieve sensitive data from any user, using an unprivileged account.

Besides hashed session cookies or api keys in cleartext, a malicious user can retrieve the password\_forget\_token atributte which leads to account takeover when “Lost password” feature is enabled.

The steps are the following:

1. Choose a known email or get a list of them using autocompletion

GET /glpi/ajax/autocompletion.php?=UserEmail&field=email&term=

2. Get a list of all generated tokens

GET /glpi/ajax/autocompletion.php?=User&field=password\_forget\_token&term=

3. Invoke “Lost password” with target email

4. Get a list of all generated tokens again and compute the difference to get your freshly generated token

5. Set new password using /glpi/front/lostpassword.php?password\_forget\_token=[token]

To sum up: an unprivileged user could steal any account or escalate privileges by changing super-admin password. It’s also possible to steal admins’ api keys and use them with malicious purposes.
