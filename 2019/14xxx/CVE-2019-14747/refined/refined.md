- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when copying a survey, specifically the `surveyName` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the survey name.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, potentially leading to stealing cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious websites or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a crafted GET request to the `/design/my-survey-design!copySurvey.action` endpoint, including malicious JavaScript in the `surveyName` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint, which would be typically done via a web browser.
