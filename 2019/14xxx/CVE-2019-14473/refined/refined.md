    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content directly addresses CVE-2019-14473. It details how a guest or user-level account on eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 devices can exploit a lack of authorization checks to perform administrative actions.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper authorization checks when using session IDs for authentication.  The system relies on the presence of a session ID for authentication but does not properly check the authorization level associated with the session before executing privileged actions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Authorization (CWE-285)"
      ],
      "impact": "A low-privileged (guest or user level) authenticated attacker can gain administrative control of the system. This includes:\n- Creating a new admin-level account.\n- Reading service messages.\n- Clearing the system protocol.\n- Modifying or deleting internal programs/scripts.\n- Escalation of Privileges, Denial of Service and Information Disclosure at the WebUI.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack is performed by sending HTTP POST requests to specific endpoints of the web interface, using a valid session ID. These requests contain specially crafted XML payloads within a `<prototypejs><![CDATA[...]]></prototypejs>` tag to trigger administrative actions.",
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid session ID obtained by logging into the system as a guest or a user-level account. The attacker also needs to know the vulnerable endpoint URLs (e.g. `http://1.2.3.4/esp/system.htm`) and have the ability to craft the necessary HTTP POST requests."
