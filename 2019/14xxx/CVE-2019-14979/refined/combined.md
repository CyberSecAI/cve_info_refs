  Hello,

  The WPVulnDB lists a security-issue with the plugin up to the newest version 1.6.17. Will there be a fix for this soon?

  Best regards

  I wouldn’t hold out hope. This vulnerability was originally posted 2019-01-27 and there have been 8 releases since then

  Hi all,

  We have determined that the conditions being reported do not constitute an exploit in the PayPal Checkout extension for WooCommerce. While it is true that the amount can be manipulated in the PayPal payment flow, this amount is validated against the WooCommerce order total before completing the order, and if it doesn’t match then the order will be left in an “On Hold” state. (In cases when the order is completed upon API payment request rather than IPN, the amount comes directly from the order, not a previous PayPal response.)

  If we were to receive exploit steps that result in a completed WooCommerce order with a lower payment amount (can be reported [here](https://hackerone.com/automattic)), we would act promptly to address the issue.

  Thank you,

  Paul
