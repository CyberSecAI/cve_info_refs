- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection on multiple admin panel delete functionalities. Specifically, delete actions are performed via GET requests without requiring a CSRF token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability, lack of CSRF tokens on sensitive delete actions in the admin panel.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can force a logged-in administrator's browser to execute malicious requests, leading to deletion of various critical data and settings within the application. This can cause denial of service and loss of functionality for the store.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML page containing a form that automatically submits a delete request to the vulnerable application. This page can then be delivered to the victim (administrator) via various methods (e.g., phishing). When the victim opens this page in their browser while logged into the Bagisto admin panel, the malicious request will be executed, resulting in data deletion.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to entice a logged-in administrator to open a malicious page. The administrator needs to have an active session in the vulnerable application at the time of the attack.
