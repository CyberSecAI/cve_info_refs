Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14892:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content explicitly mentions **CVE-2019-14892** in several places, including:

*   Red Hat Bugzilla entry for bug 1758171, which is directly linked to CVE-2019-14892.
*   The description within the Bugzilla entry: "Serialization gadgets in classes of the commons-configuration package."
*   Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) that address this CVE.
*   NetApp Security Advisory NTAP-20200904-0005, specifically about "CVE-2019-14892 FasterXML jackson-databind Vulnerability".

This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The root cause lies in the `jackson-databind` library's ability to perform polymorphic deserialization of objects using classes from the `commons-configuration` library, specifically version 1 and 2. This deserialization can lead to the instantiation of malicious objects through JNDI classes present in `commons-configuration`.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The core vulnerability is an insecure deserialization issue in `jackson-databind`. The library doesn't properly sanitize or validate the class types being deserialized when using polymorphic type handling. This allows the instantiation of arbitrary objects, including those that can trigger JNDI lookups and lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability exists when polymorphic type handling methods like `enableDefaultTyping()` or when `@JsonTypeInfo` is using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS` or in any other way which `ObjectMapper.readValue` might instantiate objects from unsafe sources.
    
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to:
    *   Arbitrary code execution on the target system.
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information
    *   Addition or modification of data
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
  
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the deserialization of a crafted malicious object via a vulnerable `jackson-databind` library. This would typically occur when an application deserializes untrusted input using a vulnerable configuration of `jackson-databind`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send malicious, serialized data to an application that uses a vulnerable version of `jackson-databind` configured to use polymorphic deserialization of objects from the `commons-configuration` library
    *   The attacker does not necessarily need to be local to the system. Exploitation often occurs remotely.
    *   The application needs to be configured to deserialize using a vulnerable configuration of `jackson-databind`.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because `jackson-databind` doesn't properly validate the classes that are being deserialized, particularly when polymorphic type handling is enabled.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the use of JNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface) classes within the `commons-configuration` package.
*   The `xalan` package also contains classes that can be leveraged as serialization gadgets in jackson-databind.
*   The fix involves blocking the problematic classes to prevent exploitation.
*   The vulnerability affects applications that use `jackson-databind` versions prior to 2.9.10, 2.8.11.5, and 2.6.7.3.
*   Red Hat notes that `Satellite 6` does not enable polymorphic unmarshmalling, which is required for the vulnerability to be exploited.
*   Red Hat also notes that OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins ship with the vulnerable component, but it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described, thus lowering its impact.
*   Red Hat recommends avoiding deserialization from untrusted sources, avoiding the usage of `enableDefaultTyping()`, `@JsonTypeInfo using id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`.

**4. Affected Products (Based on Red Hat Bugzilla and NetApp Advisories)**

*   Several Red Hat JBoss products including: Enterprise Application Platform, BPMS, Data Virtualization & Services, Process Automation, Decision Manager, Single Sign-On, Data Grid, and OpenShift Application Runtimes
*   Red Hat Fuse
*   EAP-CD 19 Tech Preview.
*   Various NetApp products are explicitly stated as **not affected** by this CVE. The vulnerability exists in the `jackson-databind` library, but many of their products do not use it in a way that it is exploitable. Some of the explicitly unaffected NetApp products are: 7-Mode Transition Tool, AFF Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - A700s, ATTO FibreBridge - 6500N, Active IQ Unified Manager, Brocade Fabric OS, Cloud Insights Telegraf Agent, Cloud Manager, Clustered Data ONTAP, E-Series SANtricity OS Controller Software 11.x, Element .NET SDK, and others.

**5. Resolution Information:**

*   Red Hat patched the issue in `jackson-databind` versions 2.9.10 and 2.6.7.3 and provided updates for several affected Red Hat products
*   NetApp's advisory states "None", which implies their products do not directly use the vulnerable component in a way that's exploitable. However, they recommend to verify and apply relevant updates if a product is using the `jackson-databind` library.

**Summary of the extracted data:**

The content provides a good understanding of CVE-2019-14892. It details how an insecure deserialization vulnerability in `jackson-databind` can be exploited using classes from the `commons-configuration` or `xalan` packages to achieve remote code execution.
