Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stemmed from the assumption that `Sanitizer::stripAllTags()` would return safe HTML when, in fact, it is documented as HTML-unsafe. This function was used to process edit summaries in feed pages within the MobileFrontend extension of MediaWiki.

**Weakness/Vulnerability:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The failure to properly sanitize edit summaries allowed for the injection of malicious JavaScript code. This is a classic XSS vulnerability where user-supplied data is displayed without proper encoding, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary scripts within a user's browser session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript into edit summaries, which would then execute when other users viewed the feed pages containing the compromised summaries.
- This could potentially lead to various malicious actions, such as:
  - Stealing user session cookies.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
  - Defacing pages.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector was through crafting a malicious edit summary that contained JavaScript code.
- When the compromised edit summary was displayed in a feed page (e.g., user contributions page, watchlist), the injected JavaScript would execute within the user's browser context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need to have the ability to edit a page and create an edit summary containing the malicious script. This typically requires an account on the MediaWiki instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was identified in the MobileFrontend extension, affecting mobile views of MediaWiki sites.
- The fix involved correctly escaping edit summaries before they are rendered in the feed pages.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2019-14807.
- The patch was applied to the master branch and backported to the 1.31, 1.32, and 1.33 release branches of the MobileFrontend extension.
- The vulnerable code was located in `includes/specials/MobileSpecialPageFeed.php`.
- The problematic line was changed from `$summary = Sanitizer::stripAllTags( $row->rev_comment )` to `$summary = htmlspecialchars( Sanitizer::stripAllTags( $row->rev_comment ) )`.
