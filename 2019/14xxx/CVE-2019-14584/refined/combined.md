CryptoPkg/BaseCryptLib: fix NULL dereference ([CVE-2019-14584](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r5j3-cc22-8xx9 "CVE-2019-14584"))

REF: <https://bugzilla.tianocore.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1914>

AuthenticodeVerify() calls OpenSSLs d2i_PKCS7() API to parse asn encoded
signed authenticode pkcs#7 data. when this successfully returns, a type
check is done by calling PKCS7_type_is_signed() and then
Pkcs7->d.sign->contents->type is used. It is possible to construct an asn1
blob that successfully decodes and have d2i_PKCS7() return a valid pointer
and have PKCS7_type_is_signed() also return success  but have Pkcs7->d.sign
be a NULL pointer.

Looking at how PKCS7_verify() [inside of OpenSSL] implements checking for
pkcs7 structs it does the following:
- call PKCS7_type_is_signed()
- call PKCS7_get_detached()
Looking into how PKCS7_get_detatched() is implemented, it checks to see if
p7->d.sign is NULL or if p7->d.sign->contents->d.ptr is NULL.

As such, the fix is to do the same as OpenSSL after calling d2i_PKCS7().
- Add call to PKS7_get_detached() to existing error handling

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1889486#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2020-10-19 18:43:26 UTC  ``` AuthenticodeVerify() calls OpenSSLs d2i_PKCS7() API to parse asn encoded signed authenticode pkcs#7 data. when this successfully returns, a type check is done by calling PKCS7_type_is_signed() and then Pkcs7->d.sign->contents->type is used. It is possible to construct an asn1 blob that successfully decodes and have d2i_PKCS7() return a valid pointer and have PKCS7_type_is_signed() also return success  but have Pkcs7->d.sign be a NULL pointer.
