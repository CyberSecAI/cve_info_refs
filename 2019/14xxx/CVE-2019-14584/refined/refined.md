Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14584:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference in the `AuthenticodeVerify()` function within the `edk2` project's `BaseCryptLib`. This occurs during the processing of ASN.1 encoded Authenticode PKCS#7 data using OpenSSL's `d2i_PKCS7()` API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `AuthenticodeVerify()` function relies on the `PKCS7_type_is_signed()` function and then accesses the `Pkcs7->d.sign->contents->type`.
- It's possible to construct a malformed ASN.1 blob that can successfully decode using `d2i_PKCS7()`, pass the `PKCS7_type_is_signed()` check, but still have `Pkcs7->d.sign` be a NULL pointer.
- The code lacks proper null-checks for the `Pkcs7->d.sign` pointer before accessing its members, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A crafted ASN.1 blob could cause a NULL pointer dereference, potentially leading to a crash or denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could provide a specially crafted ASN.1 blob as input to the vulnerable `AuthenticodeVerify()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to supply the malicious input to the `AuthenticodeVerify()` function. This is likely to involve tampering with the input that the Authenticode verification is performed on.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is related to how OpenSSL's `PKCS7_verify()` function checks for PKCS7 structures. This involves calling `PKCS7_type_is_signed()` and `PKCS7_get_detached()`, and the fix involves adding a call to `PKCS7_get_detached()` in the error handling of `AuthenticodeVerify()` to match OpenSSL's implementation
- The fix involves adding a call to `PKS7_get_detached()` within the existing error handling.
