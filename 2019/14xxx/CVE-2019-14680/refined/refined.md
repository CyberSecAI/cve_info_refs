The provided content is related to CVE-2019-14680.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of a nonce check in the `form.php` file of the Admin renamer extended plugin. This allows for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): The plugin does not use a nonce to protect against CSRF attacks in the user renaming functionality.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can force a logged-in administrator to change the username of another user, without their consent, by sending a crafted request.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack can be performed by crafting an HTML page that submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint when a logged in administrator visits the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious webpage that triggers the crafted POST request.
