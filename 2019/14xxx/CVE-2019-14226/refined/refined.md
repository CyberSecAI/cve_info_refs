The provided content includes details for multiple vulnerabilities, and some of them are related to CVE-2019-14226. Here's the breakdown:

**CVE-2019-14226 Related Vulnerabilities**

Based on the provided text, there are two distinct vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-14226:

**1. Information Exposure (CWE-200)**
    *   **Root Cause:** The system exposes information about external sharing URLs to users without administrative permissions.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Information Exposure. Specifically, the `share_url` parameter was included in API responses for users without administrative access to modify it.
    *   **Impact:**  Users with "Viewer" permissions could discover sharing links. This allows them to maintain access to shared content even after their permissions have been revoked.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network access. A user with limited access to a shared folder can obtain the sharing URL through API responses.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be a user with non-administrative permissions to a shared folder.

**2. Improper Access Control (CWE-284)**
    *   **Root Cause:** The attachment API allows users to add attachments to "private" tasks if they have access to the task folder.
    *   **Vulnerability:** Improper access control when handling attachments to "private" tasks.
    *   **Impact:** Users with access to the folder containing "private" tasks can unexpectedly add content to them, even though they can't directly access the task itself. This could be used to add malicious attachments.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Network access. A user with folder access can use the attachment API.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be a user who has access to the folder containing a "private" task, and they need to use the API directly.

**Additional Improper Access Control (CWE-284) Vulnerability (also in the document, but not related to CVE-2019-14226)**
  * **Root Cause**: API allows modification of appointment visibility within shared folders by users other than the creator.
  * **Vulnerability**: Improper Access Control.
  * **Impact**: Users other than the creator can modify the visibility (e.g., private/public) of appointments within shared folders. This is considered a minor, cosmetic issue.
  * **Attack Vector**: Network access through API calls.
  *   **Attacker Capabilities**: An attacker needs to be a user with "author" permissions for a shared calendar folder and needs to use the API to modify the "class" parameter.

**Other Vulnerabilities (NOT related to CVE-2019-14226)**

The document also describes several other vulnerabilities:

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (CWE-918):** The system's iCal subscription mechanism follows HTTP redirects, enabling attackers to redirect requests to internal network targets and gather information. (CVE-2019-14225).
*   **Two Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-80) vulnerabilities:**
    *   Script code in calendar appointment titles being executed in the calendar print view. (CVE-2019-14227).
    *   Folder selectors not properly escaping folder names leading to XSS in appointment dialogs. (CVE-2019-14227).

**Summary of relevant details for CVE-2019-14226:**
   -  **Vulnerability 1:** Information Exposure via the sharing URL parameter
   - **Vulnerability 2:** Improper Access Control in attachment API for private tasks
   - **Impact:** The vulnerabilities allow unauthorized access and modification of data due to weak access controls and information leaks
   - **Attack vectors:** Network access through API calls.
   - **Required attacker capabilities:** Need non-admin access to shared folders, or have shared folder access
