CVE-2019-14329:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Stored XSS vulnerability in EspoCRM Version 5.6.5 due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: The application fails to properly sanitize the firstName and lastName parameters when creating a User.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities when a user views the compromised data.
  - Attack vectors: By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to /espocrm/api/v1/User with a malicious JavaScript payload in the firstName or lastName parameters.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the EspoCRM server.

  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the EspoCRM server.

The github.com content includes code-level changes that address XSS vulnerabilities by implementing output escaping using `this.getHelper().escapeString()` in various JavaScript files within the EspoCRM client. This function is used to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the user interface.
