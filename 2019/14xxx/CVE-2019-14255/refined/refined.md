Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-14255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two main issues in how go-camo handled requests:

1.  **Improper Handling of Filtered Request Types:** Although go-camo was designed to reject non-GET/HEAD requests with a "405 Method not allowed" response, it was still making the outgoing request to the upstream server.
2.  **No Validation of Redirects Against Blacklists/Whitelists:** Redirect URLs were not being checked against configured blacklists or whitelists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The combination of the above two issues created a blind SSRF vulnerability. Attackers could craft malicious requests that bypass method filtering and then be redirected to internal resources.
*   **Bypassed Access Controls:** The lack of redirect validation allowed bypassing of intended IP address restrictions, potentially granting access to internal services not meant to be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Internal Endpoints:** Attackers could make HTTP requests to internal network resources, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing actions on those internal services.
*   **Blind SSRF:**  Even when the initial request was rejected (e.g., POST), the vulnerable application would still initiate a request and could be used to interact with internal services without returning a response.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Requests:** Attackers would craft requests with non-GET/HEAD methods (like POST) to an endpoint. While the response would return a 405, the crafted request would still be sent to the upstream server.
*   **Redirection Exploitation:** The initial request would be redirected to an internal endpoint using a 307 redirect.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be on the internal network, and can send a malicious request from the outside.
*   **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests that include a valid HMAC, and provide a URL that results in a redirect.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes mitigation steps: upgrading to version 1.1.5, or disabling redirects via `--max-redirects=0`.
*   The content provides a detailed description of the vulnerability, including a sequence diagram illustrating the attack. This is more detailed than a basic CVE description.
*   The content also mentions that the ruleset for filtering is not evaluated in-order and first match in each phase wins.

The provided information clearly relates to CVE-2019-14255 and offers a good breakdown of the vulnerability.
