# libmcpp: Denial of service — GLSA **202208-04**

Multiple vulnerabilities in libmcpp could result in a denial of service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-cpp/libmcpp** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.7.2\_p5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.7.2\_p5** |

### Background

libmcpp is a portable C/C++ preprocessor.

### Description

A buffer overflow and an out-of-bounds read vulnerability have been discovered in libmcpp, which could be exploited for denial of service.

### Impact

An attacker that can provide crafted input to libmcpp could achieve denial of service.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All libmcpp users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-cpp/libmcpp-2.7.2_p5"

```
