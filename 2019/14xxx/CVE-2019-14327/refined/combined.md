A plugin to create a your own Custom Simple RSS Feed

according to parameters you choose!

\*\*\* the best solution for using MailChimp RSS campaigns \*\*\*

**in simple words:**

Ever wanted an rss feed for just a specific Author and specific Category?

Or Even an rss feed for a specific Custom Field ???

Well… now you got it !

The plugin does not alter your default wordpress feeds – it enables you to display feeds **on the fly** via specific url with pre defined url query parameters.

**for example:**

display only 5 items from specific category order by name descending:

www.yordomain.com/?call\_custom\_simple\_rss=1&csrp\_posts\_per\_page=5

&csrp\_orderby=name&csrp\_order=DESC&csrp\_cat=4

**Filter items by:**

* category id
* post type
* post status
* tag
* range of dates
* and even meta keys and values!
* NEW! filter by custom taxonomy

**Order by:**

* name
* date
* author
* ID
* etc

**More Features:**

* number of items to return
* pagination
* show post thumbnail or not?
* set post thumbnails size to display?
* show post custom fields (espically usefull if your using your rss as an affliate feed)
* filter by date published or modified

This is a great plugin. It has clear instructions on how to use it. I wanted to include an image in an RSS feed. There are a lot of plugins out there that do this the wrong way. This one does it the right way. Thank you!

Was writing my own RSS template and then found this. Great timesaver and works right away. Is there a way to add just excerpts to the feed?
