{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin registers the `ajax_delete_file()` function to be accessible through WordPress' AJAX functionality to any logged-in user. The function uses `unlink()` on a path derived from user input without sufficient validation, allowing for arbitrary file deletion.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authenticated arbitrary file deletion vulnerability.",
       "Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) in the `attachment_id` parameter.",
       "Insufficient validation of user-supplied paths before using `unlink()`."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with a valid WordPress user account (Contributor role or higher, based on the PoC) can delete arbitrary files on the server where the WordPress installation is hosted.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the `action` parameter set to `rwmb_delete_file` and providing a file path in the `attachment_id` parameter and a valid nonce for the corresponding field.",
      "required_capabilities": [
          "A valid WordPress user account with Contributor role or above.",
           "Knowledge of a valid nonce associated with a file field created by the Meta Box plugin."
        ]
