  "CVE-2019-14437": {
    "Description": "The xiph_SplitHeaders function in modules/demux/xiph.h in VideoLAN VLC media player 3.0.7.1 does not check array bounds properly. As a result, a heap-based buffer over-read can be triggered via a crafted .ogg file.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Improper array bounds check in `xiph_SplitHeaders` function.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can trigger a heap-based buffer over-read, potentially leading to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted .ogg file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted .ogg file to the victim."
