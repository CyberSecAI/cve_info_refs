Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 systems use session IDs for authentication but lack proper authorization checks. This means that once a session ID is obtained, it can be used to perform actions without verifying if the user is authorized to perform those actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Authorization (CWE-285):** The core vulnerability is the lack of authorization checks after a session ID is obtained. The system doesn't properly verify if the user associated with the session ID has the necessary privileges to perform the requested action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker who obtains a valid session ID can:

- **Information Disclosure:**
   - Read service messages (device communication errors, etc.).
- **Data Manipulation:**
   - Clear the system protocol.
   - Modify or delete internal programs/scripts.
   - Deactivate, make inoperable, or hide programs/scripts.
- **Account Manipulation:**
   - Create a new admin-level account (though the password isn't set, rendering it non-functional)
- **Denial of Service:**
    - The vulnerability can also be exploited to start a denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface of the CCU2/CCU3.
- **Session ID Acquisition:** The attacker needs to obtain a valid session ID. This can be done by exploiting the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-9583 which allows obtaining session IDs without login.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be able to access the web interface of the Homematic CCU2 or CCU3 system.
- The attacker must exploit CVE-2019-9583 or another method to obtain a valid session ID.
- No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content offers more detail than the typical CVE description, including specific curl commands for exploitation:
   - Examples of clearing system protocols, reading service messages, and manipulating programs are given.
- The vulnerability affects firmware versions of CCU2: 2.47.12, 2.47.15 (and likely earlier) and CCU3: 3.47.10, 3.47.15 (and likely earlier)
- The author contacted the vendor (eQ-3 AG) on 07.05.2019 but there is no confirmation nor patch available.
- The vulnerability has a CVSSv3 base score of 10.0, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a critical severity level.
