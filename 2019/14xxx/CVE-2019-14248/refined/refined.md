The content describes a NULL-ptr dereference vulnerability in the limit pragma parser of NASM (Netwide Assembler).

- Root cause: When "%pragma limit" is not followed by any words, the asm parser reaches the end of the file, and `nasm_get_word()` returns NULL. However, `process_pragma()` continues to parse parameters, expecting them in the next word, leading to `nasm_set_limit()` being called with a NULL pointer.
- Weakness: Lack of proper NULL pointer checks when parsing the limit pragma.
- Impact: A NULL-ptr dereference, causing a segmentation fault and program termination.
- Attack vector: Crafting an assembly file with a "%pragma limit" directive at the end of the file, without any subsequent arguments.
- Required attacker capabilities: Ability to provide a malicious assembly file to NASM for assembly.
