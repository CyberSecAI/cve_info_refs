The provided content is related to CVE-2019-14350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "body" parameter when creating a knowledge base record.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application does not filter user-supplied data in the body parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, which is then executed in the browser of other users when they view the knowledge base article. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is via a crafted POST request to the `/api/v1/KnowledgeBaseArticle` endpoint. The attacker injects the malicious JavaScript code within the "body" parameter during knowledge base record creation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated and have the authorization to create a knowledge base article. The attacker also needs to know the correct API endpoint and the format of the request.
