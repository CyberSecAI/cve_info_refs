### Bug Description

It would appear Nova is revealing information that may be sensitive in error messages

<http://lists.openstack.org/pipermail/openstack-infra/2019-July/006426.html>

I attempted to hard-reboot it, and it went into an error state. The

initial error in the server status was

{'message': 'Timed out during operation: cannot acquire state change lock (held by monitor=remoteDispatchDomainCreateWithFlags)', 'code': 500, 'created': '2019-07-25T07:25:25Z'}

After a short period, I tried again and got a different error state

{'message': "internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: lc=,keyid=masterKey0,iv=jHURYcYDkXqGBu4pC24bew==,format=base64 -drive 'file=rbd:volumes/volume-41553c15-6b12-4137-a318-7caf6a9eb44c:id=cinder:auth\_supported=cephx\\;none:mon\_host=172.24.0.56\\:6789", 'code': 500, 'created': '2019-07-25T07:27:21Z'}

I don't know if this is a setting or a bug. Better to report and close than not say anything I guess.

I don't know, ianw posted it from an opendev outage yesterday. Can we add Mohammed Naser to this thread as well, I am pretty sure he would want to follow.

This is indeed an API response. I have researched this and I think we're safe (from a provider perspective):

{'message': "internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: lc=,keyid=masterKey0,iv=jHURYcYDkXqGBu4pC24bew==,format=base64 -drive 'file=rbd:volumes/volume-41553c15-6b12-4137-a318-7caf6a9eb44c:id=cinder:auth\_supported=cephx\\;none:mon\_host=172.24.0.56\\:6789", 'code': 500, 'created': '2019-07-25T07:27:21Z'}

There are two concerns here:

"lc=,keyid=masterKey0,iv=jHURYcYDkXqGBu4pC24bew==,format=base64"

There is a generated key for every single VM booted inside QEMU, this points to that specific key ID and includes the initialization vendor (iv). It does not include the key that decrypts the cephx secret

"file=rbd:volumes/volume-41553c15-6b12-4137-a318-7caf6a9eb44c:id=cinder:auth\_supported=cephx\\;none:mon\_host=172.24.0.56\\:6789"

This actually is a bit more concerning because it leaks out the IP address of the Ceph monitor. In our case, it lives in an entirely different network that cannot be accessed but that's not the case for everyone...

"Timed out during operation: cannot acquire state change lock (held by monitor=remoteDispatchDomainCreateWithFlags)"

This is a libvirt exception that is getting bubbled up.

IMHO: We should \*never\* leak exceptions that bubble up in this way to the API layer, especially to a non-admin user.

{'message': "internal error: process exited while connecting to monitor: lc=,keyid=masterKey0,iv=jHURYcYDkXqGBu4pC24bew==,format=base64 -drive 'file=rbd:volumes/volume-41553c15-6b12-4137-a318-7caf6a9eb44c:id=cinder:auth\_supported=cephx\\;none:mon\_host=172.24.0.56\\:6789", 'code': 500, 'created': '2019-07-25T07:27:21Z'}
There are two concerns here:
"lc=,keyid=masterKey0,iv=jHURYcYDkXqGBu4pC24bew==,format=base64"
There is a generated key for every single VM booted inside QEMU, this points to that specific key ID and includes the initialization vendor (iv). It does not include the key that decrypts the cephx secret
"file=rbd:volumes/volume-41553c15-6b12-4137-a318-7caf6a9eb44c:id=cinder:auth\_supported=cephx\\;none:mon\_host=172.24.0.56\\:6789"
This actually is a bit more concerning because it leaks out the IP address of the Ceph monitor. In our case, it lives in an entirely different network that cannot be accessed but that's not the case for everyone...
"Timed out during operation: cannot acquire state change lock (held by monitor=remoteDispatchDomainCreateWithFlags)"
This is a libvirt exception that is getting bubbled up.
IMHO: We should \*never\* leak exceptions that bubble up in this way to the API layer, especially to a non-admin user.

I'm going to dig through the code where this happened and what caused this result. I'll discuss privately with some of the Nova cores and ask them to be added here if they're interested.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â """Starts a created guest.

:param pause: Indicates whether to start and pause the guest

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â """

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â flags = pause and libvirt.VIR\_DOMAIN\_START\_PAUSED or 0

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â try:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â return self.\_domain.createWithFlags(flags)

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â except Exception:

===========

This bubbles up any exceptions from libvirt, the function that calls it..

nova/virt/libvirt/guest.py

===========

Â Â Â Â def \_create\_domain(self, xml=None, domain=None,

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â power\_on=True, pause=False, post\_xml\_callback=None):

if not utils.is\_neutron():

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â guest.enable\_hairpin()

===========

This also handles no exceptions, so it goes up to \_create\_domain\_and\_network() which has a case to grab all generic exceptions

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â except Exception:

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â # Any other error, be sure to clean up

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â LOG.error('Failed to start libvirt guest', instance=instance)

===========

but that still bubbles up.. in this case, up to \_hard\_reboot() which has no exception handling, which is called by reboot() that has no exception handling, which means at this point, we've sent a \*libvirt\* exception up to the compute manager.. more specifically reboot\_instance() which is decorated by the following:

Â Â Â Â @reverts\_task\_state

Â Â Â Â @wrap\_instance\_event(prefix='compute')

Â Â Â Â @wrap\_instance\_fault

===========

- wrap\_exception: this seems to emit notifications on exceptions

- reverts\_task\_state: pretty self explanitory

- wrap\_instance\_event: this seems like it adds an instance action to the log

- wrap\_instance\_fault:L

So:
nova/virt/libvirt/guest.py
===========
def launch(self, pause=False):

I don't object to subscribing more Nova developers, but note that I've already subscribed the Nova core security reviewers, so some of the folks you're thinking of could already be covered by that.

I can't edit that and hit enter too quickly so I'll keep going:

- wrap\_exception: this seems to emit notifications on exceptions

- reverts\_task\_state: pretty self explanitory

- wrap\_instance\_event: this seems like it adds an instance action to the log

- wrap\_instance\_fault: this is the culprit which seems to catch exceptions but set a fault on the VM (which is where this was exposed)

We'll have to decide where the issue was here, but IMHO, taking a non-handled exception and exposing it to the user directly can be pretty dangerous.

So the issue is the traceback with the sensitive details in the instance fault, right? That's not exposed to end users, only admins (not even really configurable in the policy specific to faults, it's just the is\_admin rule):

<https://developer.openstack.org/api-guide/compute/faults.html>

Now the logic in ^ is a bit suspect, if the fault code is not 500 then we could have issues. What is the fault code in this case? Are non-admin tenant users able to see this?

Note that the related instance action event details would be in a similar situation since the records a traceback when the reboot fails on the instance action event:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/manager.py#L3447>

<https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/?expanded=show-server-action-details-detail#show-server-action-details>

Again that traceback in the event should only be viewable by admins by default policy (os\_compute\_api:os-instance-actions:events rule).

Having said all that, the fault interface, like instance actions, are not a very solid interface, meaning they don't really get audited, so I wouldn't be surprised if non-500 faults could be exposed to non-admin users depending on the exception that gets raised and logged. In this case it's a libvirtError that results in some generic NovaException so that's why it's a 500 code. For example, any nova exception class that extends nova.exception.Invalid would have a code of 400 and those could potentially leak out I suppose.

Ugh, OK. So in this particular case, the instance goes to ERROR state from the reboot failure here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/manager.py#L3537>

The exception is re-raised and the fault (libvirtError) gets recorded by the wrap\_instance\_fault decorator:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/manager.py#L3448>

This is what sets the message field on the InstanceFault:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/utils.py#L109>

This is likely where the libvirtError gets turned into the message:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/utils.py#L78>

Trying to play whack-a-mole with all of the places that could raise unexpected exceptions from lower layers, like the hypervisor in this case, is going to be a losing game. We should probably just restrict the fault message to admin-only since we don't audit them and this is python so explicitly handling typed exceptions isn't a thing.

Deciding \*where\* to obfuscate the message is the question I think. We could say that for any non-NovaException types (where format\_message() is implemented), we could just include the message if context.is\_admin here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/utils.py#L78>

But that won't fix old compute nodes until you patch them. It also doesn't mean that NovaExceptions handled here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/utils.py#L73>

Wouldn't also expose something from a lower level because we have several exceptions like this:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/exception.py#L267>

Where whatever lower level error happens gets turned into the "reason" value.

Given that, it probably makes most sense to just add a new policy rule that is checked in the API to determine if the fault message can be shown here:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/servers.py#L553>

And the policy rule would default to admin-only. A policy rule is better since deployments could tailor it so non-admin support personal could still see those details but not the tenant user that owns the server.

If we do that, I'd also fix the logic here so we rely on policy rather than this janky code logic:

<https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/servers.py#L562>

We should probably just restrict the fault message to admin-only since we don't audit them and this is python so explicitly handling typed exceptions isn't a thing.
Deciding \*where\* to obfuscate the message is the question I think. We could say that for any non-NovaException types (where format\_message() is implemented), we could just include the message if context.is\_admin here:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/utils.py#L78
But that won't fix old compute nodes until you patch them. It also doesn't mean that NovaExceptions handled here:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/compute/utils.py#L73
Wouldn't also expose something from a lower level because we have several exceptions like this:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/exception.py#L267
Where whatever lower level error happens gets turned into the "reason" value.
Given that, it probably makes most sense to just add a new policy rule that is checked in the API to determine if the fault message can be shown here:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/servers.py#L553
And the policy rule would default to admin-only. A policy rule is better since deployments could tailor it so non-admin support personal could still see those details but not the tenant user that owns the server.
If we do that, I'd also fix the logic here so we rely on policy rather than this janky code logic:
https://github.com/openstack/nova/blob/2c0cb71fb0ac0d502dc9fed24211e1ef15407b8f/nova/api/openstack/compute/views/servers.py#L562

Per my suggested solution in comment 17, regarding backports, I think the API behavior change is OK on stable in this case since we'd be:

1. secure by default

2. justify the change b/c of security

3. have a release note

4. and the policy rule allows a deployer to re-expose the leaks if they want, e.g. to their private cloud CI/CD dev team that is all internal traffic

Personally, I don't like the policy rule on the fault message field. I mean, it's okay if we want that in general, but that's not a reasonable solution to the problem I think, because it means nobody gets any information about why things failed anymore (like even NoValidHost).

It sucks to have to whack-a-mole the exceptions, but I think addressing it in compute/utils where we stringify unknown exceptions is a good plan. However, I don't think we can conditionally do that based on context.is\_admin because some admin doing an operation would record this same information in the fault which another user could then see.

So I think what we should do is change the behavior which stringifies any unknown (i.e. non-NovaException) exception to always just grab the exception.\_\_name\_\_ (which we already do if the exception doesn't stringify to something non-Falsey) instead of the full message and record that. The details will still be there for admin viewers, but we treat any non-NovaException as could-be-sensitive and only record the name.

We'll need to backport it, it won't be fixed until all computes are upgraded, and people may have sensitive things in their databases now that need scrubbing. However, this is the right solution, IMHO. If we want a message policy toggle as well (in general or to mitigate exposure while scrubbing and upgrading) then that's fine I guess, although it does seem like an unfortunate thing for admins to turn off such that failed instance boots just go to ERROR with no explanation.

Just wanted to point out that the fault message is the only communication we have to the user about why the instance is in ERROR state. If we make that admin-only, then there will be no indication to non-admin end users about why their instance is in ERROR. It would be a major change and I'm not sure whether we should to go that far? I thought the end user (even non-admin) being able to have some info about why their instance is in ERROR is important for user experience, even if the info is something the "NoValidHost".

In general, I think we usually control what goes into the fault message (above the virt driver layer), but inside the drivers, looks like it's the wild west. I'm wondering if we could do something more like expose only the first sentence of a lower-level error in our handling decorators, by truncating it. And leave the full traceback for the fault "detail" which is admin-only by default policy.

I do empathize that we don't want to be playing whack-a-mole here. I'm just a bit hesitant about the idea of removing all ERROR state info for non-admin users.

Could it be easier that the API layer will only expose exception+message when adming but only the exception name when not admin (i.e. user would only see "libvirtError" for example)

@mnaser: Dan and I talked through this before he posted his comment and as he noted admins will still see the details in the fault which is the traceback and that's only for non-nova exceptions, but you'd still have the info you need as admin. So I don't think what you're proposing in comment 21 is worthwhile, and it would be complicated because like the examples Dan gives, where the fault is record (compute) and where it's exposed (api) are totally different and knowing the context / policy stuff at the compute isn't really possible with the current fields on the fault object, i.e. if we had message like today, details like today, and then some new field like "type" or something and in the API only showed type for the message to non-admins or whatever. That's just a bigger change.

I plan on working a patch with functional test for Dan's suggestion in comment 19. When I wrote my ideas before that I failed to remember NoValidHost which is important to not break for UX.

Note the 2nd FIXME in the test about the error message not showing up in the traceback details of the fault which could be a problem since the admin won't see the error, only the type and traceback.

Here is a patch with the proposed code fix and changes to the functional test. Note that in this case the non-admin tenant user:

- only sees the exception type class name for the fault message

- does not see details in the fault response

The admin user:

- only sees the exception type class name for the fault message

- sees the exception value (previously what they'd see in the fault message) and traceback in the fault details

WIP since I need to fix test fallout and add a release note once we have a CVE/OSSA.

This version contains a diff with -U25 for easier review and also resolves some failing unit tests as a result of how the fault message and details are stored. I've tried to document the impacted unit tests to make that clear.

This version also includes a release note with a TODO to include the CVE and OSSA information.

For all intents and purposes, besides the reno, this is my proposed version for final review.

I also probably need to check out of the compute API reference and API guide since they might need updating when talking about faults:

According to our Embargoed Disclosure[\*] timeline, assuming the patches attached to this bug are considered ready and we send the pre-OSSA notification to downstream stakeholders on Wednesday (to give those subscribed to this bug a reasonable chance to object to the schedule) the earliest we can open this bug, push changes to public code review, and publish the OSSA will be Tuesday, August 6. Does this work for everyone?

Thanks very much for your work on this. Just one nit comment. I think "obfuscate" might not be the right word to use in the commit message. Maybe just use "replace"? I think obfuscate is not a desired security approach in the security community. See "security through obscurity".

Sure, will take that into account when pushing the patches to Gerrit for public review if it's all the same. I need to update the release note on the patches with the CVE as well when it goes up for public review.

Replace non-nova server fault message

The server fault "message" is always shown in the API

Â Â Â Â server response, regardless of policy or user role.

The fault "details" are only shown to users with the

Â Â Â Â admin role when the fault code is 500.

The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the

Â Â Â Â fault message is a string-ified version of the exception

Â Â Â Â (see nova.compute.utils.exception\_to\_dict) which can

Â Â Â Â contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner

Â Â Â Â of the server can see.

This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue

Â Â Â Â and a change to exception\_to\_dict which for the non-nova

Â Â Â Â case changes the fault message by simply storing the

Â Â Â Â exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault

Â Â Â Â traceback in the "details" key of the fault dict in the

Â Â Â Â server API response. Note that \_get\_fault\_details is

Â Â Â Â changed so that the details also includes the exception

Â Â Â Â value which is what used to be in the fault message for

Â Â Â Â non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still

Â Â Â Â get the exception message with the traceback details.

Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement

Â Â Â Â variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as

Â Â Â Â well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case

Â Â Â Â basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all

Â Â Â Â fault messages otherwise users might not see information

Â Â Â Â like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status

Â Â Â Â during scheduling.

SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.

Replace non-nova server fault message
The server fault "message" is always shown in the API
server response, regardless of policy or user role.
The fault "details" are only shown to users with the
admin role when the fault code is 500.
The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the
fault message is a string-ified version of the exception
(see nova.compute.utils.exception\_to\_dict) which can
contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner
of the server can see.
This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue
and a change to exception\_to\_dict which for the non-nova
case changes the fault message by simply storing the
exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault
traceback in the "details" key of the fault dict in the
server API response. Note that \_get\_fault\_details is
changed so that the details also includes the exception
value which is what used to be in the fault message for
non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still
get the exception message with the traceback details.
Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement
variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as
well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case
basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all
fault messages otherwise users might not see information
like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status
during scheduling.
SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.

The server fault "message" is always shown in the API
server response, regardless of policy or user role.
The fault "details" are only shown to users with the
admin role when the fault code is 500.
The problem with this is for non-nova exceptions, the
fault message is a string-ified version of the exception
(see nova.compute.utils.exception\_to\_dict) which can
contain sensitive information which the non-admin owner
of the server can see.
This change adds a functional test to recreate the issue
and a change to exception\_to\_dict which for the non-nova
case changes the fault message by simply storing the
exception type class name. Admins can still see the fault
traceback in the "details" key of the fault dict in the
server API response. Note that \_get\_fault\_details is
changed so that the details also includes the exception
value which is what used to be in the fault message for
non-nova exceptions. This is necessary so admins can still
get the exception message with the traceback details.
Note that nova exceptions with a %(reason)s replacement
variable could potentially be leaking sensitive details as
well but those would need to be cleaned up on a case-by-case
basis since we don't want to change the behavior of all
fault messages otherwise users might not see information
like NoValidHost when their server goes to ERROR status
during scheduling.
SecurityImpact: This change contains a fix for CVE-2019-14433.
NOTE(mriedem): In this backport the functional test is
modified slightly to remove the DiskFilter since we are
using placement for scheduler filtering on DISK\_GB.

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2622)

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-nova: Nova server resource faults leak external exception details (CVE-2019-14433)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* Previously, the heal info cache periodic task used the network info cache to heal the network info cache. If the cache was corrupted or missing, the heal info cache task could not heal the network info cache.

With this update, the heal info cache uses VM data from Neutron when healing the network info cache. (BZ#1703225)

* Previously, evacuation, migration, and resize operations took unnecessarily long to process on destination hosts with a large number of network interfaces. This was due to the my\_ip configuration printing a warning when it did not find any of the host interfaces.

With this update, the my\_ip configuration occurs only once during host initialization. This reduces the time it takes to process migrations, evacuations, and resize operations. (BZ#1732879)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

## Affected Products

* Red Hat OpenStack for IBM Power 13 ppc64le
* Red Hat OpenStack 13 x86\_64

## Fixes

* [BZ - 1703225](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1703225)
  - instance\_info\_caches table with invalid data does not heal - over 1000 instances affected
* [BZ - 1721433](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1721433)
  - [OSP13] 'hw\_vif\_model' image metadata property should be ignored for SR-IOV-based VIFs
* [BZ - 1735522](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1735522)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other usersâ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a programâs source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hatâs CVE database.

When a technologyâenabled and most likely used by defaultâcompletely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-trackingÂ  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.Â  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.Â  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.Â  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.Â  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.Â  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14433
Debian Bug     : 934114

It was found that authenticated users could trigger a fault in Nova, a
cloud computing fabric controller, to cause information leak.

In addition, this update includes some fixes for volume live migration,
as well as the addition of a /healthcheck URL for monitoring.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2:18.1.0-6+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your nova packages.

For the detailed security status of nova please refer to

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# RHSA-2019:2652 - Security Advisory

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Updated Packages](#packages)

## Synopsis

Moderate: openstack-nova security and bug fix update

## Type/Severity

Security Advisory: Moderate

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2652)

## Topic

An update for openstack-nova is now available for Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14.0 (Rocky).

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

OpenStack Compute (nova) launches and schedules large networks of virtual machines, creating a redundant and scalable cloud computing platform. Compute provides the software, control panels, and APIs required to orchestrate a cloud, including running virtual machine instances and controlling access through users and projects.

Security Fix(es):

* openstack-nova: Nova server resource faults leak external exception details (CVE-2019-14433)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* [OSP14] 'hw\_vif\_model' image metadata property should be ignored for SR-IOV-based VIFs (BZ#1724122)
* [OSP14] Snapshot image of shelved instance, using rbd backend for glance and nova, remains due to an exception after unshelving. (BZ#1725708)
* Before, a REVERT\_RESIZE operation could fail if using the iptables\_hybrid firewall driver. This would happen due to Neutron sending the network-vif-plugged external event before Nova starts to listen for it. Now, Nova will start listening for network-vif-plugged external event based on the characteristics of the port. In the case of an OVS hybrid plug, it will start listening before sending the port binding request to Neutron. (BZ#1730728)
* [OSP14] Evacuation takes more than 2 hours with 109 instances depending on number of NIC on destination. (BZ#1732880)

## Solution
