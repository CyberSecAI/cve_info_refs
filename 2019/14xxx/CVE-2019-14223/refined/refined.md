Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14223:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the `failure` parameter within the Alfresco Share application's login functionality. This allows an attacker to control the redirection URL upon a failed login attempt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. The application redirects the user to a URL specified in the `failure` parameter without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can redirect victims to malicious websites designed to steal credentials or other sensitive information.
- **NetNTLM Hash Theft:** By redirecting victims to a malicious SMB share, attackers can potentially capture the victim's NetNTLM hash, which can then be cracked or used for further attacks.
- **Arbitrary Protocol Redirection:** The vulnerability allows redirection using various protocols (e.g., `http`, `https`, `smb`, `ftp`), increasing the range of potential attack vectors.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specially crafted POST request to the `/share/page/dologin` endpoint.
- **Manipulation of "failure" Parameter:** The key to the attack lies in the manipulation of the "failure" parameter within the POST request's form data. The attacker injects a malicious URL into this parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/HTTPS POST requests to the targeted Alfresco Share instance.
- **Basic Understanding of HTTP:** Knowledge of how to construct HTTP POST requests and manipulate URL parameters is required.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not require prior authentication. The vulnerability is triggered during a failed login attempt.

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example POST request demonstrates how to insert a malicious URL into the `failure` parameter.
- The server responds with a 302 Found redirect, with the `Location` header containing the attacker-controlled malicious URL.
- The response snippets show how both HTTP(S) and SMB protocols can be leveraged for redirection.
- Versions affected are below 5.2.6, 6.0.N, and 6.1.N, where "N" stands for any patch version within 6.0 and 6.1
