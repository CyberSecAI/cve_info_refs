### CVE-2019-14986
```
**Root cause:** Improper access control in the 'CUxD' AddOn for eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3. The CUxD administration interface is not forced to be secured by basic authentication during setup, leaving many installations unprotected.

**Vulnerability:** Exposes features like File-Browser and Shell Command (as well as 'Set root password') without authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:** Unauthenticated attackers with access to the web interface can perform administrative operations. This includes:
  *   Directory traversal using the file browser.
  *   Remote code execution via the "Shell command" function.
  *   Potentially setting the root password.

**Attack vector:** By sending specific HTTP requests to the CUxD administration interface, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit the exposed features.

**Required attacker capabilities:**
  *   Network access to the web interface of the Homematic CCU2 or CCU3.
  *   The target system must have the 'CUxD' AddOn installed with a version prior to 2.3.0.
  *   The CUxD administration interface must not be protected by a valid user session (i.e., basic authentication is not enabled or enforced).
