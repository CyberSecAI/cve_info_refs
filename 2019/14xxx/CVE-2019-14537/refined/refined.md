This allows for type juggling attacks where strings resembling numbers are treated as numbers in comparisons, leading to unauthorized access.\n\nWeaknesses/vulnerabilities present:\n- Type juggling vulnerability in password authentication.\n- Type juggling vulnerability in cookie authentication.\n- Type juggling vulnerability in API signature verification.\n- Type juggling vulnerability in time-limited token verification.\n\nImpact of exploitation:\n- Bypassing authentication, granting unauthorized access to the admin panel.\n- Bypassing API authentication, allowing unauthorized API requests.\n- The time limited token can be abused to gain unauthorized access to the API without any requisite.\n\nAttack vectors:\n- Submitting a password that, when interpreted as a number, results in an equality with the stored (plaintext) password.\n- Submitting a crafted cookie that when interpreted as a number results in equality with the stored cookie value.\n- Submitting a crafted API signature that looks like a number and results in bypassing the authentication.\n- Submitting a timestamp with decimals that produces a valid looking but not really valid signature.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\n- The attacker needs access to the YOURLS login page or API endpoint and must have a basic understanding of PHP's type juggling behavior and MD5 hash algorithm."
