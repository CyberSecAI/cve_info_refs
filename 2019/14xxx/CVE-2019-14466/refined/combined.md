### @fmeum **[fmeum](/fmeum)** commented [Jul 29, 2019](#issue-474071411)

GOsa currently uses `unserialize` to restore filter settings from a cookie. Since this cookie is supplied by the client, authenticated users can pass arbitrary content to `unserialized`, which opens GOsa up to a potential [PHP object injection](https://blog.ripstech.com/2018/php-object-injection/).

This PR protects against such issues by switching to the safe `json_decode` method.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Package        : gosa
Version        : 2.7.4+reloaded2-1+deb8u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14466

GOsa² used unserialize to restore filter settings from a cookie. Since
this cookie was supplied by the client, authenticated users could have
passed arbitrary content to unserialized, which opened GOsa² up to a
potential PHP object injection.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.7.4+reloaded2-1+deb8u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your gosa packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
