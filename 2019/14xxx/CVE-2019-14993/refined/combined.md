| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c0)  Holger Seelig    2018-06-15 10:48:15 UTC  ``` std::regex crashes when matching long lines.  Here is an example:   #include <regex> #include <iostream>   int main() {     std::string s (100'000, '*');     std::smatch m;     std::regex r ("^(.*?)$");      std::regex_search (s, m, r);      std::cout << s .substr (0, 10) << std::endl;     std::cout << m  .str (1) .substr (0, 10) << std::endl; }   It turns out that std::regex_search operator .* is implemented recursively which result in this example in a stack overflow. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c1)  ktkachov    2018-06-15 11:12:42 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 86163](show_bug.cgi?id=86163 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - std::regex crashes when matching long lines") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c2)  ktkachov    2018-06-15 11:13:53 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 86165](show_bug.cgi?id=86165 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - std::regex crashes when matching long lines.") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c3)  Vadim Zeitlin    2018-11-13 23:46:30 UTC  ``` BTW, this is unrelated to using grouping in the regex, searching for something as simple as "A.*B" also crashes for input longer than ~27KiB on Linux amd64 with g++ 8.2.0. This makes std::regex simply unusable. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c4)  Jonathan Wakely    2018-11-14 00:08:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Vadim Zeitlin from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c3)) > This makes std::regex simply unusable.  Yes, because there are no uses with inputs below 27KiB. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c5)  Vadim Zeitlin    2018-11-14 00:12:49 UTC  ``` I obviously meant that it makes it unusable in my use case when I can't guarantee that the input is bounded by this (smallish) size. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c6)  Nils Gladitz    2018-12-05 07:33:02 UTC  ``` I think I am hitting this issue somewhat earlier on an ARM system with a more limited stack size.  Was able to reproduce it on Desktop x86_64 Linux with e.g.:  #include <regex>    int main() {     std::regex_match(         std::string(2000, 'a'),         std::regex(".*")     ); }  $ ulimit -s 256 # 256kb stack; which is what have by default on the ARM system $ g++ test.cpp -o regex_test $ ./regex_test Segmentation fault (core dumped) ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c7)  Giuliano Belinassi    2019-03-29 12:48:29 UTC  ``` It seems that the issue is the backtracking required by the NFA, as it enters in a deep recursion when calling _M_dfs in _M_main_dispatch (regex_executor.tcc).  Maybe moving the DFS stack from the recursion stack to the heap and use an iterative DFS could fix this, but converting the NFA to DFA may be a better choice, as it removes the backtracking requirement when iterating with the string. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c8)  Jonathan Wakely    2019-03-29 20:24:25 UTC  ``` I started working on a patch to replace the recursion with iteration, but didn't get it working yet. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c9)  Boris Kolpackov    2021-09-14 07:33:10 UTC  ``` Any progress on this?  I get the segfault (due to stack overflow) with the following trivial regex:    regex re ("#+",);   regex_search (string (32 * 1024, '#'), re);  In comparison, MSVC's implementation crashes on much larger input (in the above test it is still able to match 4MB string) while libc++ doesn't seem to have any stack-related limits (I was able to match 40MB).  I see two issues here:  1. It would have been nice if implementation-related limits were reported with an exception rather than a crash.  2. The limits seem to be really low, both practically (matching 32KB doesn't feel unreasonable) and compared to other implementations. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c10)  Jonathan Wakely    2021-09-22 09:08:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 84865](show_bug.cgi?id=84865 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Regular expression regex_search falls into infinite loop causing segfault on crayxc machines") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c11)  Jonathan Wakely    2021-12-16 00:05:36 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 93502](show_bug.cgi?id=93502 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - std::regex_match uses stack space proportional to input string length") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c12)  Jonathan Wakely    2021-12-16 00:08:03 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 84738](show_bug.cgi?id=84738 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - stack-overflow in regex_match") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c13)  Maarten L. Hekkelman    2022-08-18 17:11:08 UTC  ``` Too bad this bug has still not been dealt with. And it is even worse that simply running out of stack space seems to be acceptable. And no, I'm not using inputs in the form of 27kB, more like just a few hundred characters at most with quite complex expressions.  Fortunately, it is now very easy to use the boost::regex as a standalone library as a replacement. But alas, that's still a dependency. ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c14)  Jonathan Wakely    2022-08-22 11:06:11 UTC  ``` Running out of stack space is not acceptable, that's why this is considered a bug. As already stated in [comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c8), I started work on fixing it, but the rewritten code had bugs that I haven't had time to resolve yet. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=86164#c15)  Nadav Har'El    2023-04-09 16:02:58 UTC  ``` More than 5 years later, more and more projects are discovering this bug the hard way, and moving from std::regex to boost::regex which doesn't have this bug - boost::regex defaults to BOOST_REGEX_NON_RECURSIVE mode, which uses a stack on the heap instead of recursion (but I don't know if the specific examples shown the various duplicates all need this stack in practice, for example it's unfortunate if matching " *" needs to copy the entire input string in a stack). The latest example of this exodus is <https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb/pull/13452>.  So I think it's about time this issue is solved. Maybe even the Boost implementation can studied for inspiration and implementation ideas? ``` |  |

Hello everyone,

We’d like to call your attention to a recent [Envoy announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/envoy-announce/jlNq3_aXx4E) that affects Istio:

> The Envoy security team would like to announce the forthcoming release of Envoy 1.11.1.
>
> This release will be made available on Tuesday, the 13th of August 2019 at 10:00 PDT (17:00 GMT).
>
> This release will fix 5 security defect(s), all of them considered HIGH severity.
>
> No further details or patches will be made available in advance of the release.

At the same time the Envoy community makes 1.11.1 available (August 13th at 10am PDT), the Istio team will publish Istio 1.2.4 and 1.1.13 containing fixes for the same 5 defects.

We've noticed that requests with a very long URI crashes our envoy service for routes defined using a regex matcher.

We're not sure if it's due to some overflow bug in Envoy's regex parser, but ideally Envoy should not crash because of a long URI.

*Repro steps*:

Define a route with a match regex like the following:

```
"match": {
    "regex": "/asdf/.*"
}

```

and then make a request with a large URI:

```
val longString = "a" * (50 * 1024)
client.send("GET", "/asdf/{longString}")

```

We've gotten around it by using a `prefix` matcher instead, but this appears to be a potential DoS vulnerability if not a security issue.

# ISTIO-SECURITY-2019-003

Denial of service in regular expression parsing.

Aug 13, 2019

| Disclosure Details | |
| --- | --- |
| CVE(s) | [CVE-2019-14993](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14993) |
| CVSS Impact Score | 7.5 [AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV%3aN%2fAC%3aL%2fPR%3aN%2fUI%3aN%2fS%3aU%2fC%3aN%2fI%3aN%2fA%3aH&version=3.0) |
| Affected Releases | 1.1 to 1.1.121.2 to 1.2.3 |

An Envoy user reported publicly an issue (c.f. [Envoy Issue 7728](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/7728)) about regular expressions (or regex) matching
that crashes Envoy with very large URIs. After investigation, the Istio team has found that this issue could be leveraged for a DoS attack in Istio, if users are employing regular expressions in some of the Istio APIs: `JWT`, `VirtualService`, `HTTPAPISpecBinding`, `QuotaSpecBinding`.

## Impact and detection

To detect if there is any regular expressions used in Istio APIs in your cluster, run the following command which prints either of the following output:

* YOU ARE AFFECTED: found regex used in `AuthenticationPolicy` or `VirtualService`
* YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED: did not find regex usage

```
$ cat <<'EOF' | bash -
set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail

red=`tput setaf 1`
green=`tput setaf 2`
reset=`tput sgr0`

echo "Checking regex usage in Istio API ..."

AFFECTED=()

JWT_REGEX=()
JWT_REGEX+=($(kubectl get Policy --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{..regex}'))
JWT_REGEX+=($(kubectl get MeshPolicy --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{..regex}'))
if [ "${#JWT_REGEX[@]}" != 0 ]; then
  AFFECTED+=("AuthenticationPolicy")
fi

VS_REGEX=()
VS_REGEX+=($(kubectl get VirtualService --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{..regex}'))
if [ "${#VS_REGEX[@]}" != 0 ]; then
  AFFECTED+=("VirtualService")
fi

HTTPAPI_REGEX=()
HTTPAPI_REGEX+=($(kubectl get HTTPAPISpec --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{..regex}'))
if [ "${#HTTPAPI_REGEX[@]}" != 0 ]; then
  AFFECTED+=("HTTPAPISpec")
fi

QUOTA_REGEX=()
QUOTA_REGEX+=($(kubectl get QuotaSpec --all-namespaces -o jsonpath='{..regex}'))
if [ "${#QUOTA_REGEX[@]}" != 0 ]; then
  AFFECTED+=("QuotaSpec")
fi

if [ "${#AFFECTED[@]}" != 0 ]; then
  echo "${red}YOU ARE AFFECTED: found regex used in ${AFFECTED[@]}${reset}"
  exit 1
fi

echo "${green}YOU ARE NOT AFFECTED: did not find regex usage${reset}"
EOF
```
## Mitigation

* For Istio 1.1.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.1.13](/latest/news/releases/1.1.x/announcing-1.1.13/) or later
* For Istio 1.2.x deployments: update to [Istio 1.2.4](/latest/news/releases/1.2.x/announcing-1.2.4/) or later.
