[OLED Side Channel Observations and Mitigation](/posts/oled-side-channel-part2/)

During security research in April 2019, I have discovered that the common OLED SSD1306-like displays used in many cryptocurrency hardware wallets and other embedded devices are **leaking information** about the display contents towards the USB interface from which the device is powered.
This represents an interesting side channel that had so far not been discovered by other vendors and researchers.

## Technical background

Illuminating the OLED pixels takes a comparably large amount of current per pixel and this type of display illuminates pixels on a line-by-line basis. As a result, there is a strong electrical side channel for the display contents through the current fluctuations on the USB power line that can be measured without hardware modifications to the device itself.

Here is a graphical representation of the effect on an unmodified KeepKey, traced over 2Â½ display cycles:

## Security implications, attack scenario, mitigations

The side channel is relevant since the security design of this class of devices is built to some degree on the assumption that the display contents are readable by the user, but unreadable to other involved electronics. If this confidentiality assumption does not hold in practice, there is the possibility that malicious equipment is able to recover significant portions of PIN codes or BIP39 mnemonic words.

Many of the relevant technical aspects and implications are described in the [Trezor blog article on the issue](https://blog.trezor.io/details-of-the-oled-vulnerability-and-its-mitigation-d331c4e2001a) that I have co-written.

I will present more details and attack scenario considerations via additions to this post and later articles.

### Practical impact

Power analysis shows this correlation on the BIP39 secret word display of the Trezor One.

## Disclosure Coordination

From April to August 2019, Iâve analyzed a number of devices for their susceptibility to this attack and responsibly disclosed the issue to the affected vendors. Coordinating the disclosure of a hardware vulnerability among multiple competing vendors is not a straightforward process and there were a number of challenges along the way. I may write about them at some point in the future.

### CVEs

I initially requested a CVE ID from MITRE in July.

Due to [CVE Numbering Authority rules](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna/rules.html#Appendix_C_counting_decisions), the vulnerability was split into individual CVEs on a per-vendor basis:

![Possible Information Leak, Considered Unlikely](/images/posts-img/cve-mitigated.png)

![Mitigations in v2.1.2](/images/posts-img/cve-mitigated.png)

# Possible Display Information Leak

On August 7th, Christian Reitter is announcing a possible side-channel
data leak as a vulnerability across all hardware wallets which use
OLED displays. At Coinkite, we’ve already mitigated it, even though
we feel strongly that it is not a legitimate issue. In our opinion,
it is both unproven (might not even work) and also completely
impractical—even if it could be made to work perfectly.

TL;DR: Long-shot vulnerability breathlessly announced, install the
[latest firmware (v2.1.2)](https://coldcardwallet.com/docs/upgrade)
to get our just-in-case mitigations.

## Background

We received an email earlier this year describing a possible issue
and telling us to keep it secret for months. The idea was that the
graphical display commonly used on hardware wallets, including the
Coinkite Coldcard, was leaking information over the USB power lines
about what it’s showing on the screen. Naturally enough, bright “ON”
pixels take more energy than “OFF” pixels.

Your attacker would have to install monitoring hardware into the
USB power source you use to power the Coldcard **during the initial
seed setup**. We don’t know how bulky that would be, but if you use
a trusted USB battery pack or AC adapter, you would be fine. If
you’re like me, your home or office has hundreds of AC adapters and
thousands of USB cables to choose from… Each of these would need
the mythical “hardware implant” installed beforehand to get a
chance to capture your seed the **one time** it is shown on screen.

**We challenged Christian for more specific details and a proof of
concept. He never really provided anything solid, just a few scope
captures of varying noise and no solid evidence that it directly
represented the screen contents.** Normally, we’d expect to see a
proof of concept demo, where he reconstructs the screen contents.
That would make for a good presentation!

(Aside: We don’t appreciate how he’s doxed our company emails to
others in the industry when he carelessly sends out bulk emails.)

## The Risks

But what do we show on screen that’s a secret? Not much.

When you first setup a Coldcard, the seed words are shown on screen
so you can write them down as a backup. That’s the only time this
private key material is shown to the user.

Each digit of the PIN is shown briefly as you enter the PIN so
that’s a hazard as well, but since there is no real-world implementation
of this information leak, we don’t know if that’s long enough
on screen to get a “good read” of the PIN digits.

## The Solution

Coldcard firmware version 2.1.2, [available for download
already,](https://coldcardwallet.com/docs/upgrade) has mitigations for
both those areas: when entering the PIN, your digits are no longer
echoed. Instead an X is shown, except if using a Mk1 device with
it’s fine touch interface—you need the echo as a feedback.

For the few moments of the Coldcard’s lifecycle where the seed words are
shown on screen, we’ve added masking noise along the right hand
side of the screen. Since we don’t have a working proof-of-concept,
it’s not possible to conclusively prove that this plugs the leak,
but we feel the large amount of random noise on each line will be
enough to swamp out any valid data that might be leaked on this
side channel.

In future hardware, we intend to improve USB power supply filtering
so that very little noise (or is it signal?) comes out of the
Coldcard. That’s a broader mitigation and would help if some other,
as yet unknown, information leak exists.

## Credits

We’d like to thank Christian for being responsible in his disclosure
of this issue, and it’s good we have researchers looking at these
things. We hope that disclosure of unproven/minor issues doesn’t
lead to fatigue or complacency in the community.

Christian applied for, and received `CVE-2019-14356` as a code number
for the Coldcard version of this issue. We are not involved in
that process with MITRE.

# CVE-2019-14357 - Team Statement and Firmware Updates

On May 12th 2019 the Mooltipass team has been made aware of a side channel attack affecting the OLED screen controller (SSD1305) used in the Mooltipass Mini, as part of a coordinated responsible disclosure effort that included multiple vendors and a common public disclosure date.

## Attack Practical Implementation

At the time of writing (August 7th 2019) this attack was demonstrated by Christian Reitter through the use of a modified USB cable with a 5 ohms shunt resistor on the ground return. The voltage across the shunt resistor was then fed to a low priced sound card input and then run through a Fast Fourrier Transform (FFT).

Visual analysis of the FFT showed distinct patterns depending on the PIN digit shown on the Mooltipass Mini screen.

## Attack Technical Details

Small OLED screens such as the one used in the Mooltipass Mini implement a display technique called row scanning. Similarly to what is demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyviz8ggq5A) a display controller powers one screen row after the other quickly enough so that the human eye only sees a still image.
As OLED screens power consumption are directly related to the number of pixels switched on, a display controller consumes a different amount of power depending on the number of pixels switched on for a given row. When displays only have a limited set of displayed information, it is therefore possible to guess what is shown on the screen by looking at the device dynamic power consumption.

## Attack Practical Limitations

For this side channel attack to be implemented at the time of writing (August 7th 2019) **physical** access to the user environment is required, together with a **modified USB cable** with an embedded processing unit running power consumption analysis and a **covert** way of exporting the processing results.

However, as only visual analysis of power consumption was performed on a single Mooltipass device, algorithmic recognition of screen contents was **not** demonstrated, as with the wireless implementation of this side channel attack.

## Mooltipass Team Stance

The Mooltipass team does **not** believe this attack to be realistically implementable as it can easily be seen by users. Moreover, the Mooltipass team believes this attack implementation to be more risky and complex than a single hidden camera looking at the Mooltipass Mini screen contents.

## Mitigation and Firmware Updates

The Mooltipass team successfully devised a mitigation technique consisting of constant row pixel count.

When asking for a user's PIN, additional pixels are added to the display in order to keep the row pixel count constant across the part of the screen displaying PIN digits. This mitigation has been checked and verified by Christian Reitter.

Even though the Mooltipass team does not believe this side channel to be realistically implementable, firmware updates are available and can be requested at questionableupdates@themooltipass.com (please mention your unit's serial number and order / backer number).

***Important notice**: Since BC Vault uses the **SSD1309 OLED** controller instead of the **SSD1306**, the text below assumes that the former controller is also similarly exploitable* – to be confirmed with the submitter of the CVE.

On the 8. May. 2019 we were made aware of a side channel vulnerability present in all devices that use the SSD1309 OLED controller. This was discovered by Mr. Christian Reitter, who communicated with us in a coordinated responsible disclosure effort and submitted the [CVE](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14359).

*The vulnerability is based on the fact that SSD1309 OLED controllers which are often used in embedded security devices only display one pixel row at a time instead of all rows at once, and requires a comparably large amount of energy to do so. It was found that there is a direct correlation between the number of illuminated pixels on each row and the total power consumption of the device at a particular moment.*

*An
attacker with the ability to perform a power consumption analysis of the device
while it is displaying secrets on the screen can conceivably use this partial
information of the pixel distribution of each row to recover confidential
information through statistical analysis.*

**The
attack can be carried out as follows:**

1. Obtain physical access to the
   usb cable or usb port.
2. Install a shunt resistor to
   measure voltage at a sufficient accuracy (this was achieved using bulky
   laboratory equipment such as an oscilloscope or a software defined radio)
3. Convince the victim to enter
   their credentials while connected to the setup.

At the present time we are not aware of any
possibility to carry out this attack remotely or in a way that is completely
invisible to the victim.

**We
investigated the issue and came to the following conclusions:**

BC Vault uses SSD1309 OLED controller and is susceptible to having its screen contents read via this attack.

BC Vault intentionally NEVER displays any
confidential information on the OLED screen, excluding transaction information
which may impact privacy. We do not use seed words, nor do we ever show the
actual PIN on the device itself. The only information that could be obtained by
an attacker interested in the private keys via this method is the length of the
PIN itself. This is insufficient information to gain access to the private keys
as they are also protected by the device and wallet passwords.

Cryptowallets using BIP39-44 that display
the seed words to the user during initialization could pose a greater risk to
the individuals using them as an attacker can fully compromise all wallets past
present and future on the device should they succeed in reading the words from
the display.

**Planned
or active mitigations:**

Due to the nature of this vulnerability we deem it to be an insignificant risk to users of the BC Vault hardware cryptowallet. We may reevaluate this at a later point, but are not currently planning any mitigations.

The number of characters in the PIN are visible, but the contents are not.

When backing up your data the screen never displays any confidential information.

#### **TL; DR**

By hooking on the USB cable or connector it
is possible to read the display of most hardware wallets (see CVEs below)

The OLED in BC Vault is susceptible but
never displays any confidential information on the display besides the length
of the PIN.

Wallets using BIP39-44 seed words are
vulnerable during initialization.
