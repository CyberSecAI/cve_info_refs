CVE-2019-14874: __i2b null pointer dereference bug
```

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: In the `__i2b` function of the newlib libc library (see newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c), `Balloc` is used to allocate a big integer, however no check is performed to verify if the allocation succeeded or not.
- **Vulnerability**: Missing NULL check after memory allocation.
- **Impact**: Accessing `_x[0]` will trigger a null pointer dereference bug in case of a memory allocation failure.
- **Attack vector**: Triggering the `__i2b` function with a condition that leads to memory allocation failure in `Balloc`.
- **Affected component**: `__i2b` function in `newlib/libc/stdlib/mprec.c`.
