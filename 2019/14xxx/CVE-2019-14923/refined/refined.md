```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows remote command execution due to the use of shell metacharacters in the host field, specifically through the `popen` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Command Injection: The application does not properly sanitize the `host_name` variable before passing it to the `popen` function, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands using shell metacharacters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Command Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server hosting the EyesOfNetwork application.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious request to the `select_tool.php` endpoint, including shell metacharacters in the `host_list` parameter, which gets incorporated into a command passed to `popen`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the EyesOfNetwork application. They must have knowledge of the vulnerable `select_tool.php` endpoint and the structure of the request parameters."
