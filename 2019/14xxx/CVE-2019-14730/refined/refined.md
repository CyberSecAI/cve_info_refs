Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14730:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the CentOS Web Panel (CWP) when deleting domains. Specifically, a regular user can manipulate the `domain` parameter in the delete domain request to delete domains belonging to other users, which they should not have access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The application fails to verify if the user initiating the domain deletion is authorized to delete the specified domain.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** The application blindly trusts and uses the `domain` parameter provided in the request without validating if the user owns or has the right to delete the specified domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Domain Deletion:** A low-privileged user can delete any domain hosted on the server, regardless of the actual owner.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By deleting legitimate domains belonging to other users, the attacker can cause disruption of services and website functionality, effectively creating a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited via the web interface of the CWP, through the "Domains >> Domains" section.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid, low-privileged user account on the CWP server.
*   **Web Browser and Interception Proxy:**  The attacker needs a web browser and the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, which can be achieved by using tools such as Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.

**Technical Details:**

The attacker needs to:

1. Log in to CWP as a regular user.
2. Navigate to the "Domains >> Domains" section.
3. Initiate a domain deletion, for instance, by clicking the delete button for a domain under their account.
4. Intercept the request before it reaches the server. The vulnerable request is a POST request to a URL similar to `/cwp_47e1d536a096e42d/alice/alice/index.php?module=domains&acc=verifsubdomain`.
5. Modify the `domain` parameter in the POST request body to the name of the domain they want to delete, which belongs to another user.
6. Send the modified request to the server.

The vulnerable parameter is in the following format:
```
domain=<TARGET-DOMAIN>
```
Where `<TARGET-DOMAIN>` represents the domain to be deleted.

This vulnerability allows any user on the system to delete other user's domains by simply changing the domain name in the POST request, allowing for a large impact with low user privileges and simple attack vector.
