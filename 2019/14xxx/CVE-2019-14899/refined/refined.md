    "description": "A routing issue was addressed with improved restrictions.",
    "affected_products": [
      "macOS",
      "iOS",
        "tvOS",
      "Linux"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A routing issue within the kernel allows an attacker to inject data into active connections within a VPN tunnel.",
       "weaknesses": [
        "Inadequate restrictions on routing within the VPN tunnel."
      ],
        "impact": "An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to inject into active connections within a VPN tunnel.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "The attacker must be in a privileged network position between the VPN client and server",
             "They can be on-path or network adjacent to the VPN client"
        ],
       "required_capabilities": [
          "The attacker needs the ability to sniff packets and spoof source addresses.",
           "An understanding of TCP sequence and acknowledgement numbers is also required"
       ]
    },
      "additional_information": [
        "The vulnerability affects multiple operating systems including Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS, iOS, and Android.",
        "The attack works against OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IKEv2/IPSec.",
          "The attacker can determine the virtual IP address, if a user is using a VPN,  and what websites they are visiting by analyzing encrypted packet sizes and timing.",
          "Enabling rp_filter is not an effective solution for this vulnerability. Source address validation on the scale of the Internet doesn't exist.",
          "The vulnerability works by exploiting in-kernel connection states, allowing connections with different tags to remain invisible from each other.",
          "Client side mitigation using iptables or nftables was suggested, but this new attack has no client side solution."
