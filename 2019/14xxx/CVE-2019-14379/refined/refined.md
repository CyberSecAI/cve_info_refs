    "related": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to mishandling of default typing in jackson-databind, which allows for polymorphic deserialization of malicious objects.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Mishandling of default typing.",
      "Polymorphic deserialization of objects.",
      "Incomplete blacklist of classes for deserialization"

        "Knowledge that the vulnerable service has the affected jackson-databind and related libraries in the classpath"
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when default typing is enabled either globally or for a specific property, particularly when used in conjunction with polymorphic type handling methods like enableDefaultTyping() or when @JsonTypeInfo is using Id.CLASS or Id.MINIMAL_CLASS or in any other way which ObjectMapper.readValue might instantiate objects from unsafe sources. The presence of libraries like `commons-dbcp` or `logback` in the classpath increases the risk.",
