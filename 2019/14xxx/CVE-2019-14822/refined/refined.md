    "information": {
      "root_cause": "IBus uses a GDBusServer with `G_DBUS_SERVER_FLAGS_AUTHENTICATION_ALLOW_ANONYMOUS` and does not set a `GDBusAuthObserver`, which allows any user to connect to its AF_UNIX socket and send method calls without authorization.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Missing authorization checks on the DBus socket.",
        "Use of an abstract AF_UNIX socket, which lacks filesystem permissions, allowing access without file system permission restrictions."

      "impact": "A local attacker can intercept keystrokes of a victim user who is using a graphical interface, change the input method engine, or modify other input-related configurations.",
      "attack_vectors": "Local access to the AF_UNIX socket of the victim's IBus service.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Local unprivileged user who can discover the IBus socket address of another user."
