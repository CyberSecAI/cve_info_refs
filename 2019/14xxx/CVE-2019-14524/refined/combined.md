## Description

![@nicowaisman](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17729105?u=19fa09e1b172fb8b5ff49db51383805e2281a5bc&v=4&size=48)[nicowaisman](https://github.com/nicowaisman)opened [on Aug 1, 2019](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/issues/201#issue-475707132)

Hey schismtracker team,

I would like to report a security vulnerability in schismtracker MTM parser (fmt/mtm.c).

There is a potential heap overflow on the way schismtracker parse MTM files, specifically while working with song patterns.

On fmt\_mtm\_load\_song, it takes the number of patterns from the file in line 112

npat = slurp\_getc(fp);

And later in code, there is a loop that fills the song patterns and patterns\_sizethat is defined as:

#define MAX\_PATTERNS 240

song\_note\_t \*patterns[MAX\_PATTERNS]; // Patterns

uint16\_t pattern\_size[MAX\_PATTERNS]; // Pattern Lengths

The loop takes the value of npat directly, this is a one byte long field which maximun size can hold up to 255 entries.

/\* patterns \*/

for (pat = 0; pat <= npat; pat++) {

song->patterns[pat] = csf\_allocate\_pattern(MAX(rows, 32));

song->pattern\_size[pat] = song->pattern\_alloc\_size[pat] = 64;

tracknote = trackdata[n];

Please let me know when you have fixed the vulnerability so that I can coordinate my disclosure with yours. For reference, here is a link to Semmle's vulnerability disclosure policy: <https://lgtm.com/security#disclosure_policy>
