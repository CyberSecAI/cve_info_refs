  "CVE-2019-14858": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2019-14858",
      "Description": "A vulnerability was found in Ansible engine 2.x up to 2.8 and Ansible tower 3.x up to 3.5. When a module has an argument_spec with sub parameters marked as no_log, passing an invalid parameter name to the module will cause the task to fail before the no_log options in the sub parameters are processed. As a result, data in the sub parameter fields will not be masked and will be displayed if Ansible is run with increased verbosity and present in the module invocation arguments for the task."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability arises from a logic error in Ansible's module processing. When a module's `argument_spec` contains sub-parameters marked with `no_log`, these parameters are intended to have their values masked from output. However, if an invalid parameter name is passed to the module, task processing fails before the no_log options are handled.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of invalid parameters",
        "Failure to apply no_log settings under certain failure scenarios"
      ],
      "Impact": "Sensitive data within sub-parameter fields (marked as no_log) will be exposed when running Ansible with increased verbosity. This could lead to unintentional disclosure of secrets or other confidential information.",
      "Attack Vectors": "Local",
       "Required Capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to execute Ansible playbooks with increased verbosity using a crafted task with invalid parameter names."
    },
        "Affected Systems": [
