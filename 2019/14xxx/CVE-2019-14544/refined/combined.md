## Description

![@ManassehZhou](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2705803?u=ac4efcfe09f4e6793f89f07683f419aeea0f2946&v=4&size=48)[ManassehZhou](https://github.com/ManassehZhou)opened [on Aug 1, 2019](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/issues/5764#issue-475641650)

* Gogs version (or commit ref): newest([e640683](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/commit/e640683c97eec7f6452c24cce0e9bcff28ba0387))
* Can you reproduce the bug at <https://try.gogs.io>:
  + Yes

I discovered a misconfigured access control in the newest Gogs, I think it's some kind of bug.

I have already sent more about the details in the email to u@gogs.io.

Best,

Manasseh Zhou
