Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-14449:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- Malicious Impala queries can result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when viewed in Cloudera Manager. Specifically, a piece of JavaScript code generated within impala-shell, when viewed in the Queries tab of the Impala service in Cloudera Manager, gets executed, causing XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Cloudera Manager does not sanitize the Impala query output displayed in the user interface, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected and executed in the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a malicious user generates a piece of JavaScript in the impala-shell, that code gets evaluated, resulting in an XSS when another user views the malicious query in Cloudera Manager. This can lead to malicious actions such as stealing credentials or performing arbitrary actions as the targeted user.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user generates impala query that contains javascript. An unsuspecting victim views the malicious query using the Cloudera Manager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute queries using `impala-shell`. The attacker must also have an account on the CDH cluster and be able to use the impala shell. The attacker does not need any other privileges within Cloudera Manager. The victim must be an authenticated user of Cloudera Manager who views the malicious query.

- Impala
