{
  "CVE-2019-14444": {
    "Description": "apply_relocations in readelf.c in GNU Binutils 2.32 contains an integer overflow that allows attackers to trigger a write access violation (in byte_put_little_endian function in elfcomm.c) via an ELF file, as demonstrated by readelf.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow in the `apply_relocations` function within `readelf.c` of GNU Binutils, specifically during calculations involving relocation offsets and sizes, leading to an out-of-bounds write.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Out-of-bounds Write"
    ],
    "Impact": "A write access violation resulting in a crash of the program. An attacker could potentially gain arbitrary code execution with more sophisticated exploitation.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Processing a malicious ELF file"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker would need to craft a specific ELF file to trigger the integer overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds write during processing by `readelf` or other affected utilities.",
        "Additional Information": "SUSE considers binutils a developer tool not normally exposed to untrusted input. Therefore, they advise processing untrusted binaries on separate systems or VMs."
