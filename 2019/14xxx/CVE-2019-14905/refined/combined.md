are transferred to managed machines automatically.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c0)  Peter Tselios   2019-06-06 10:25:44 UTC  ``` The ansible-galaxy init command creates only 6 directories for each new role:  defaults handlers meta tasks tests vars  The templates and files directories are not created.   Version: ansible 2.7.10 OS: openSUSE Leap 15.1 x86_64 ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c1)  Marcel Kuehlhorn   2019-07-01 07:29:25 UTC  ``` I'm seeing the same behaviour on Tumbleweed with ansible 2.8.1  I don't know why I've become assignee here so I'm adding lrupp since he's the package maintainer ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c2)  Alynx Zhou   2019-07-01 08:24:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcel Kuehlhorn from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c1)) > I'm seeing the same behaviour on Tumbleweed with ansible 2.8.1 >  > I don't know why I've become assignee here so I'm adding lrupp since he's > the package maintainer  Thanks a lot, because I think bugzilla tells me that `lrupp@suse.com` cannot be matched, so I have to choose another person in changelog to help. Thank you again. ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c3)  Lars Vogdt   2019-09-19 14:22:41 UTC  ``` That's an interesting bug...  Workaround: If you (as root) create the missing directories on 15.1 in :    /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible/galaxy/data/default  like    sudo mkdir /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ansible/galaxy/data/default/{templates,files}  your problem should be fixed.  I am still investigating why a    %{__python} setup.py install --root=%{buildroot} in our RPM behaves different than a    python setup.py install --root=/tmp as local user. The later one installs the missing directories - the former on in our RPM does not. Might be related to the python3 switch, but I need to verify this a bit more... ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c4)  Lars Vogdt   2020-04-06 20:55:23 UTC  ``` <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/23597> is marked as closed, but it looks like even the latest ansible 2.9.6 version is still affected.  I circumvented this now by simply creating the missing directories during package build.   ------------------------------------------------------------------- Mon Apr  6 20:45:04 UTC 2020 - lars@linux-schulserver.de - 2.9.6  - create missing (empty) template and files directories for    'ansible-galaxy init' during package build (fixes [boo#1137479](http://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1137479))  -------------------------------------------------------------------  @maintenance: I like to request a version update for openSUSE Leap 15.1 from currently 2.8.1 to 2.9.6 (including the fix for this bug), as there are many more fixes from upstream included and the software is in general backwards compatible.   Incompatible change: redis_kv - a (marked as deprecated) redis lookup plugin got removed. Alternative: use 'redis <redis_lookup>' instead. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c5)  Lars Vogdt   2020-04-06 21:19:09 UTC  ``` Maintenance request for Leap 15.1 created: <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/791861> ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-08 12:30:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1137479) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/792427> 15.1 / ansible ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1137479#c7)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-12 22:13:18 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0513-1: An update that solves 8 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-26 15:49:36 UTC  ``` A vulnerability has been found in nxos_file_copy from Ansible module. Filenames are used to perform actions to copy files to a flash or bootflash on NXOS devices. However, nxos_file_copy takes remote_file parameter which is used for destination. Malicious code could crafts the filename parameter to take advantage by performing an OS command injection.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-26 15:49:38 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Abhijeet Kasurde (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c4)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-28 05:49:51 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1777693](show_bug.cgi?id=1777693 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14905 ansible: malicious code could craft filename in nxos_file_copy module [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1777692](show_bug.cgi?id=1777692 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14905 ansible: malicious code could craft filename in nxos_file_copy module [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1777691](show_bug.cgi?id=1777691 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-14905 ansible: malicious code could craft filename in nxos_file_copy module [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c7)  Abhijeet Kasurde    2019-12-02 07:22:41 UTC  ``` Adding Ganesh Nalawade who is fixing this issue.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c12)  Ganesh    2019-12-15 05:45:57 UTC  ``` PR fixed and merged to devel <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65423> Backport PR's 2.9 -> <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65846> 2.8 -> <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65847> 2.7 -> <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65848>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c13)  Hardik Vyas    2019-12-19 09:41:07 UTC  ``` Gluster and Ceph no more maintains ansible, and the plan is to use from ansible repository.

Happy new year ^_^  Could you please recheck on 2.9.2 ?  We think Ansible 2.9.2 is also vulnerable. We checked the source files of 2.9.2 ; and the related commit [1] was not embedded.  Ansible 2.8.8 and 2.7.16 are not released yet [2] so we can't check.  Regards,   Wilfried CERT Orange Cyberdefense  [1] <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65846/commits/254d8032520b712a27eef0f907e911545d593604> [2] <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/releases>   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c18)  Borja Tarraso    2020-01-02 13:20:28 UTC  ``` Hi Wilfried,  Many thanks for the report. Indeed you are right, 2.9.2 it is still vulnerable. The fix was getting ready to fix on the 2.9.2 release. However, for some reason the PR was blocked. I updated and corrected that information and contacted the engineer if there is any estimations and technicalities regarding the fix.  Regards, Borja   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c20)  Nick Tait    2020-01-08 20:13:06 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  There is no mitigation for this issue, the flaw can only be resolved by applying updates.   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c21)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-23 16:45:33 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.7 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2020:0217 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0217](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0217)   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-23 16:48:41 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.9 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:0215 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0215](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0215)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c23)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-23 16:48:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:0216 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0216](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0216)   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-01-23 16:49:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2020:0218 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0218](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0218)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1776943#c25)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-01-23 20:09:31 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 no longer maintain their own version of Ansible. Therefore this fix will be consumed directly from core Ansible.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP ansible package.   ``` |  |

## [v2.9.4](#id15)

### [Release Summary](#id16)

Release Date: 2020-01-20
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Bugfixes](#id17)

* yum - fix bug that caused `enablerepo` to not be honored when used with disablerepo all wildcard/glob ([#66549](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/66549))

## [v2.9.3](#id18)

### [Release Summary](#id19)

Release Date: 2020-01-15
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id20)

* Fixed typos in various modules regarding argument\_spec data types.
* dnf - Properly handle module AppStreams that don't define stream ([#63683](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/63683))
* docker\_container.py - update a containers restart\_policy without restarting the container ([#65993](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65993))
* docker\_stack - Added `stdout`, `stderr`, and `rc` to return values.
* zabbix\_\* - underlying python module now required in version zabbix-api==0.5.4 ([#65145](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/65145))

### [Bugfixes](#id21)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14904 - solaris\_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that. However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour. Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.
* ActionBase - Add new `cleanup` method that is explicitly run by the `TaskExecutor` to ensure that the shell plugins `tmpdir` is always removed. This change means that individual action plugins need not be responsible for removing the temporary directory, which ensures that we don't have code paths that accidentally leave behind the temporary directory.
* CVE-2019-14905 - nxos\_file\_copy module accepts remote\_file parameter which is used for destination name and performs actions related to that on the device using the value of remote\_file which is of string type However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious code could crafts the filename parameter to take advantage by performing an OS command injection. This fix validates the option value if it is legitimate file path or not.

An update that solves 8 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for ansible to version 2.9.6 fixes the following issues:
Security issues fixed:
- CVE-2019-14904: Fixed a vulnerability in solaris\_zone module via crafted
solaris zone (boo#1157968).
- CVE-2019-14905: Fixed an issue where malicious code could craft filename
in nxos\_file\_copy module (boo#1157969).
- CVE-2019-14864: Fixed Splunk and Sumologic callback plugins leak
sensitive data in logs (boo#1154830).
- CVE-2019-14846: Fixed secrets disclosure on logs due to display is
hardcoded to DEBUG level (boo#1153452)
- CVE-2019-14856: Fixed insufficient fix for CVE-2019-10206 (boo#1154232)
- CVE-2019-14858: Fixed data in the sub parameter fields that will not be
masked and will be displayed when run with increased verbosity
(boo#1154231)
- CVE-2019-10206: ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools prompt
passwords by expanding them from templates as they could contain special
characters. Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and
exposing them. (boo#1142690)
- CVE-2019-10217: Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by
no\_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set
properly. service\_account\_contents() which is common class for all gcp
modules is not setting no\_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by
that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.

Description:
This update for ansible to version 2.9.6 fixes the following issues:
Security issues fixed:

solaris zone (boo#1157968).
- CVE-2019-14905: Fixed an issue where malicious code could craft filename
in nxos\_file\_copy module (boo#1157969).
- CVE-2019-14864: Fixed Splunk and Sumologic callback plugins leak
sensitive data in logs (boo#1154830).
- CVE-2019-14846: Fixed secrets disclosure on logs due to display is
hardcoded to DEBUG level (boo#1153452)
- CVE-2019-14856: Fixed insufficient fix for CVE-2019-10206 (boo#1154232)

masked and will be displayed when run with increased verbosity
(boo#1154231)
- CVE-2019-10206: ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools prompt
passwords by expanding them from templates as they could contain special
characters. Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and
exposing them. (boo#1142690)

## [v2.8.8](#id25)

### [Release Summary](#id26)

Release Date: 2020-01-15
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id27)

* docker\_container.py - update a containers restart\_policy without restarting the container ([#65993](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65993))

### [Bugfixes](#id28)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14904 - solaris\_zone module accepts zone name and performs actions related to that. However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour. Adding user input validation as per Solaris Zone documentation fixes this issue.
* CVE-2019-14905 - nxos\_file\_copy module accepts remote\_file parameter which is used for destination name and performs actions related to that on the device using the value of remote\_file which is of string type However, there is no user input validation done while performing actions. A malicious code could crafts the filename parameter to take advantage by performing an OS command injection. This fix validates the option value if it is legitimate file path or not.
* acme\_certificate - fix misbehavior when ACME v1 is used with `modify_account` set to `false`.
* ansible-test no longer tries to install `coverage` 5.0+ since those versions are unsupported
* ansible-test no longer tries to install `setuptools` 45+ on Python 2.x since those versions are unsupported
* ansible-test now ignores warnings when comparing pip versions before and after integration tests run
* ce modules - Update(add) docs notes to tell user modules work connection.
* ce modules - Update(add) docs notes to tell user modules work connection.
* ce modules - Update(add) docs notes to tell user modules work connection.
* ce modules - Update(add) docs notes to tell user modules work connection.
* ce modules - Update(add) docs notes to tell user modules work connection.
* ce modules - Update(add) docs notes to tell user modules work connection.
* decouple k8s\_scale from the k8s module utils so that it doesn't complain about missing arguments
* dnf module - Ensure the modules exit\_json['msg'] response is always string, not sometimes a tuple.
* docker\_container - fix network idempotence comparison error.
* docker\_container - wait for removal of container if docker API returns early ([#65811](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65811)).
* docker\_network - fix idempotence comparison error.
* docker\_network - fix idempotency for multiple IPAM configs of the same IP version ([#65815](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65815)).
* docker\_network - validate IPAM config subnet CIDR notation on module setup and not during idempotence checking.
* docker\_swarm\_service - fix task always reporting as changed when using `healthcheck.start_period`.
* gitlab\_runner - fix idempotency for shared runner
* gitlab\_user - Fix adding ssh key to new/changed user and adding group membership for new/changed user
* netscaler\_service - fixed issue preventing use of graceful attribute
* openssh\_keypair - fixes idempotence issue with public key ([#64969](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64969)).
* openssl\_csr - the module will now enforce that `privatekey_path` is specified when `state=present`.
* paramiko - catch and handle exception to prevent stack trace when running in FIPS mode
* plugins-netconf-ce - Fix failed to get version information.
* roles - Ensure that `allow_duplicates: true` enables to run single role multiple times ([#64902](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/64902))
* user - on systems using busybox, honor the `on_changed` parameter to prevent unnecessary password changing ([#65711](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/65711))
* yarn - handle no version when installing module by name ([#55097](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/55097))
* yum - gracefully handle failure case of enabling a non existent repo, as the yum cli does (Fixes [#52582](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/52582))
* yum - performance bugfix, the YumBase object was being instantiated multiple times unnecessarily, which lead to considerable overhead when operating against large sets of packages.

## [v2.8.6](#id33)

### [Release Summary](#id34)

Release Date: 2019-10-17
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Minor Changes](#id35)

* ansible-test defaults to redacting sensitive values (disable with the `--no-redact` option)
* dnf - Properly handle idempotent transactions with package name wildcard globs ([#62809](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/62809))

### [Bugfixes](#id36)

* **SECURITY** - CVE-2019-14846 - Several Ansible plugins could disclose aws credentials in log files. inventory/aws\_ec2.py, inventory/aws\_rds.py, lookup/aws\_account\_attribute.py, and lookup/aws\_secret.py, lookup/aws\_ssm.py use the boto3 library from the Ansible process. The boto3 library logs credentials at log level DEBUG. If Ansible's logging was enabled (by setting LOG\_PATH to a value) Ansible would set the global log level to DEBUG. This was inherited by boto and would then log boto credentials to the file specified by LOG\_PATH. This did not affect aws ansible modules as those are executed in a separate process. This has been fixed by switching to log level INFO
* **security issue** - Convert CLI provided passwords to text initially, to prevent unsafe context being lost when converting from bytes->text during post processing of PlayContext. This prevents CLI provided passwords from being incorrectly templated (CVE-2019-14856)

## [v2.8.0](#id57)

### [Release Summary](#id58)

Release Date: 2019-05-16
[Porting Guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/porting_guides.html)

### [Major Changes](#id59)

* Experimental support for Ansible Collections and content namespacing - Ansible content can now be packaged in a collection and addressed via namespaces. This allows for easier sharing, distribution, and installation of bundled modules/roles/plugins, and consistent rules for accessing specific content via namespaces.
* Python interpreter discovery - The first time a Python module runs on a target, Ansible will attempt to discover the proper default Python interpreter to use for the target platform/version (instead of immediately defaulting to `/usr/bin/python`). You can override this behavior by setting `ansible_python_interpreter` or via config. (see [#50163](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50163))
* become - The deprecated CLI arguments for `--sudo`, `--sudo-user`, `--ask-sudo-pass`, `-su`, `--su-user`, and `--ask-su-pass` have been removed, in favor of the more generic `--become`, `--become-user`, `--become-method`, and `--ask-become-pass`.
* become - become functionality has been migrated to a plugin architecture, to allow customization of become functionality and 3rd party become methods ([#50991](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50991))

### [Minor Changes](#id60)

* A k8s module defaults group has now been added to reduce the amount of parameters required for multiple k8s tasks. This group contains all non-deprecated kubernetes modules - k8s, k8s\_auth, k8s\_facts, k8s\_scale and k8s\_service as well as the CRD-handling kubevirt\_\* modules.
* AWS EC2's Autoscaling Group (ec2\_asg) module now supports the use of Launch Templates in addition to existing support for Launch Configurations.
* Add `ansible_play_name` magic var ([#11349](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/11349))
* Add better parsing for gathering facts about free memory in Mac OS ([#52917](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/52917)).
* Add config option for chroot binary for chroot connection plugin
* Add configurable backup path option support for network config modules
* Add examples in documentation to explain how to handle multiple conditions in changed\_when and failed\_when.
* Add new meta task end\_host - [#40904](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/40904)
* Add option to read zabbix inventory per each host
* Add option to set ansible\_ssh\_host based on first interface settings
* Add parameters to module vmware\_guest for conversion of disk to thin or thick when vm is cloned or deployed with template or virtual machine.
* Add stats on rescued/ignored tasks to play recap ([#48418](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/48418))
* Add support for hex color values in Slack module.
* Add support for per\_host:no stats for the callback plugin **json** ([#43123](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/43123))
* Add variable type for performance\_insights\_retention\_period ([#49904](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/49904)).
* Add warning about falling back to jinja2\_native=false when Jinja2 version is lower than 2.10.
* Added Ansible.Basic C# util that contains a module wrapper and handles common functions like argument parsing and module return. This is gives the user more visibility over what the module has run and aligns PowerShell modules more closely to how Python modules are defined.
* Added check for assert module for msg and failed\_msg as a list or string types.
* Added documentation about the folder parameter with examples in vmware\_deploy\_ovf ([#51825](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/51825)).
* Added documentation about using VMware dynamic inventory plugin.
* Added experimental support for connecting to Windows hosts over SSH using `ansible_shell_type=cmd` or `ansible_shell_type=powershell`
* Added missing deprecation warning for param 'reboot' and use without param 'name' to the cron module.
* Added parameter checking before the module attempts to do an action to give helpful error message
* Added support for MX and SRV record in ipa\_dnsrecord module ([#42482](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/42482)).
* Added support for gateway parameter in iptables module ([#53170](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/53170)).
* Added support for iptables module iprange and its parameters src-range and dst-range
* All environment variables defined by ansible now start with the ANSIBLE\_ prefix. The old environment vars still work for now. The new environment vars added are: ANSIBLE\_LIBVIRT\_LXC\_NOSECLABEL, ANSIBLE\_DISPLAY\_SKIPPED\_HOSTS, and ANSIBLE\_NETWORK\_GROUP\_MODULES
* Allow default callback plugin to send unreachable host/task to stderr using toggle flag.
* Allow for vaulted templates in template lookup ([#34209](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/34209))
* An os module\_defaults group has been added to simplify parameters for multiple OpenStack tasks. This group includes all OpenStack modules with an os\_-prefixed module name.
* Ansible.ModuleUtils.Privilege - moved C# code to it's own util called `Ansible.Privilege` and expanded the tests
* Catch all connection timeout related exceptions and raise AnsibleConnectionError instead
* Change the position to search os-release since clearlinux new versions are providing /etc/os-release too
* Changed output of tags dictionary in results to standard Ansible format
* Cleaned up module code to remove all calls to the deprecated get\_exception() function
* Connection plugins have been standardized to allow use of `ansible_<conn-type>_user` and `ansible_<conn-type>_password` variables. Variables such as `ansible_<conn-type>_pass` and `ansible_<conn-type>_username` are treated with lower priority than the standardized names and may be deprecated in the future. In general, the `ansible_user` and `ansible_password` vars should be used unless there is a reason to use the connection-specific variables.
* Display - Add a `Singleton` metaclass and apply it to `Display` to remove the need of using `__main__.Display` as a pseudo singleton
* Drop the use of pkg\_resources. Importing pkg\_resources was the costliest part of startup time for Ansible. pkg\_resources was used so that platforms with old versions of PyCrypto and Jinja2 could use parallel installed, updated versions. Since we no longer support Python-2.6 on the controller side, we no longer have to support parallel installation to work around those old stacks.
* Embed an overridable static sanitization method into base inventory plugin class to allow individual plugins to optionally override Add override implementation to inital set of cloud plugins
* Ensures 'elapsed' is always returned, when timed out or failed
* Fix API call to \_wait\_for\_response in k8s modules ([#53937](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/53937)).
* Fix documentation of match test. Match requires zero or more characters at beginning of the string.
* Fixed bug around populating host\_ip in hostvars in vmware\_vm\_inventory.
* Gather NVMe NQN fact ([#50164](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/50164))
* Handle vault filename with UTF-8 while decrypting vault file using ansible-vault.
* Improve the deprecation message for squashing, to not give misleading advice
* Increase the default persistent command\_timeout value from 10 to 30 seconds to reduce frequent timeout issues.
* Modules and plugins have been standardized on a well-defined set of TLS-related parameters. The old names remain as aliases for compatibility. In general, the new names will override the old names if both are specified. The standard names are: `client_cert` (certificate for client identity, might also include the private key), `client_key` (private key for `client_cert`), `ca_cert` (public key to validate server's identity, usually a root certificate), and `validate_certs` (boolean to enable or disable certificate validity checking).
* Moved the FactCache code from ansible.plugins.cache.FactCache to ansible.vars.fact\_cache.FactCache as it is not meant to be used to implement cache plugins.
* Now emits 'elapsed' as a return value for get\_url, uri and win\_uri
* On Solaris, the ansible\_product\_name fact is populated for a wider range of older hardware models, and ansible\_system\_vendor fact is populated for certain known vendors.
* Parsing plugin filter may raise TypeError, gracefully handle this exception and let user know about the syntax error in plugin filter file.
* Python-3.8 removes platform.dist() from the standard library. To maintain compatibility we've switched to an alternative library, nir0s/distro, to detect the distribution for fact gathering. Distributions facts may change slightly as nir0s/distro has bugfixes which the standard library's platform.dist() has lacked.
* Raise AnsibleConnectionError on winrm connection errors
* Refactored the CLI code to parse the CLI arguments and then save them into a non-mutatable global singleton. This should make it easier to modify.
* Removed the private `_options` attribute of `CallbackBase`. See the porting guide if you need access to the command line arguments in a callback plugin.
* Support for Cumulus Linux 2.5.4 and 3.7.3 added in setup facts ([#52309](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/52309)).
* Support for Linux Mint 18.3 added in setup facts ([#52224](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/52224)).

* aws\_kms is now able to create keys and manage grants and tags
* azure\_rm\_appgateway - add redirect configurations and probes
* become - Change the default value for AGNOSTIC\_BECOME\_PROMPT to True so become prompts display BECOME password: regardless of the become method used. To display the become method in the prompt (for example, SUDO password:), set this config option to False.
* callbacks - New `v2_runner_on_start` callback added to indicate the start of execution for a host in a specific task ([#47684](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/47684))
* change default connection plugin on macOS when using smart mode to ssh instead of paramiko ([#54738](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/54738))
* change default value for `configs` from `[]` to `null` and for `update_order` from `stop-first` to `null`, matching docker API and allowing the module to interact with older docker daemons.
* cloudstack - The choice list for the param 'hypervisor' had been removed to allow the API to validate depending on your setup directly.
* cmdline fact parsing can return multiple values of a single key. Deprecate cmdline fact in favor of proc\_cmdline.
* command/shell - new stdin\_add\_newline arg allows suppression of automatically-added newline n character to the specified in the stdin arg.
* conn\_limit type is set to 'int' in postgresql\_user module. This will allow module to compare conn\_limit with record value without type casting.
* copy - support recursive copying with remote\_src
* cs\_network\_offering - new for\_vpc parameter which allows the creation of network offers for VPC.
* cs\_volume - add volumes extraction and upload features.
* cs\_zone - The option network\_type uses capitalized values for the types e.g. 'Advanced' and 'Basic' to match the return from the API.
* default value for `INVENTORY_ENABLED` option was `['host_list', 'script', 'yaml', 'ini', 'toml', 'auto']` and is now `['host_list', 'script', 'auto', 'yaml', 'ini', 'toml']`
* diff mode outputs in YAML form when used with yaml callback plugin
* dnf - added the module option `install_weak_deps` to control whether DNF will install weak dependencies
* dnf - group removal does not work if group was installed with Ansible because of dnf upstream bug <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1620324>

* docker\_container - Added support for healthcheck.
* docker\_container - Allow to use image ID instead of image name.
* docker\_container - `stop_timeout` is now also used to set the `StopTimeout` property of the docker container when creating the container.
* docker\_container - a new option `networks_cli_compatible` with default value `no` has been added. The default value will change to `yes` in Ansible 2.12. Setting it to `yes` lets the module behave similar to `docker create --network` when at least one network is specified, i.e. the default network is not automatically attached to the container in this case.
* docker\_container - improved `diff` mode to show output.
* docker\_container - mount modes in `volumes` allow more values, similar to when using the `docker` executable.
* docker\_container - published\_ports now supports port ranges, IPv6 addresses, and no longer accepts hostnames, which were never used correctly anyway.
* docker\_container, docker\_network, docker\_volume - return facts as regular variables `container`, `network` respectively `volume` additionally to facts. This is now the preferred way to obtain results. The facts will be removed in Ansible 2.12.
* docker\_image - Add `build.cache_from` option.

* docker\_image - add option `build.use_proxy_config` to pass proxy config from the docker client configuration to the container while building.
* docker\_image - all build-related options have been moved into a suboption `build`. This affects the `dockerfile`, `http_timeout`, `nocache`, `path`, `pull`, `rm`, and `buildargs` options.
* docker\_image - set `changed` to `false` when using `force: yes` to load or build an image that ends up being identical to one already present on the Docker host.
* docker\_image - set `changed` to `false` when using `force: yes` to tag or push an image that ends up being identical to one already present on the Docker host or Docker registry.
* docker\_image - the `force` option has been deprecated; more specific options `force_source`, `force_absent` and `force_tag` have been added instead.
* docker\_image - the `source` option has been added to clarify the action performed by the module.
* docker\_image - the default for `build.pull` will change from `yes` to `no` in Ansible 2.12. Please update your playbooks/roles now.
* docker\_image - the deprecated settings `state: build` and `use_tls` now display warnings when being used. They will be removed in Ansible 2.11.
* docker\_image\_facts - Allow to use image ID instead of image name.

* docker\_network - `internal` is now used to set the `Internal` property of the docker network during creation.
* docker\_network - `scope` is now used to set the `Scope` property of the docker network during creation.
* docker\_network - add new option `ipam_driver_options`.
* docker\_network - added support for specifying labels
* docker\_network - changed return value `diff` from `list` to `dict`; the original list is contained in `diff.differences`.
* docker\_network - improved `diff` mode to show output.
* docker\_secret - `data` can now accept Base64-encoded data via the new `data_is_b64` option. This allows to pass binary data or JSON data in unmodified form. ([#35119](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/35119))
* docker\_service - return results as regular variable `services`; this is a dictionary mapping service names to container dictionaries. The old ansible facts are still returned, but it is recommended to use `register` and `services` in the future. The facts will be removed in Ansible 2.12.
* docker\_swarm - Added support for `default_addr_pool` and `subnet_size`.
* docker\_swarm - `UnlockKey` will now be returned when `autolock_managers` is `true`.

* docker\_swarm\_service - Added support for passing period as string to `restart_policy_delay`.
* docker\_swarm\_service - Added support for passing period as string to `restart_policy_window`.
* docker\_swarm\_service - Added support for passing period as string to `update_delay`.
* docker\_swarm\_service - Added support for passing period as string to `update_monitor`.
* docker\_swarm\_service - Extended `mounts` options. It now also accepts `labels`, `propagation`, `no_copy`, `driver_config`, `tmpfs_size`, `tmpfs_mode`.

* docker\_volume - improved `diff` mode to show output.
* docker\_volume - option minimal versions now checked. ([#38833](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/38833))
* docker\_volume - reverted changed behavior of `force`, which was released in Ansible 2.7.1 to 2.7.5, and Ansible 2.6.8 to 2.6.11. Volumes are now only recreated if the parameters changed **and** `force` is set to `true` (instead of or). This is the behavior which has been described in the documentation all the time.
* docker\_volume - the `force` option has been deprecated, and a new option `recreate` has been added with default value `never`. If you use `force: yes` in a playbook, change it to `recreate: options-changed` instead.
* ecs\_service - adds support for service\_registries and scheduling\_strategies. desired\_count may now be none to support scheduling\_strategies
* facts - Alias `ansible_model` to `ansible_product_name` to more closely match other OSes ([#52233](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/52233))

'(' or '{' turns them into special chars, the opposite of what is intended
by using regex\_escape on strings being passed as a Basic Regular
Expression.

Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. service_account_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not setting no_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1153452#c0)  Alexander Bergmann   2019-10-09 13:23:10 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-14846  Description  Ansible, all ansible_engine-2.x versions and ansible_engine-3.x up to ansible_engine-3.5, was logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c0)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-26 15:49:57 UTC  ``` Vulnerability in solaris_zone from Ansible modules accepts the zone name to perform actions related to zones. However, while running these actions on the system, solaris_zone module check the status of the zone by executing a os.system() call and using the zone name as a parameter. A malicious user could provide a crafted zone name which allows executing commands into the server manipulating the module behaviour.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c1)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-26 15:50:00 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Abhijeet Kasurde (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c4)  Borja Tarraso    2019-11-28 05:49:43 UTC  ``` Created ansible tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1777690](show_bug.cgi?id=1777690 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14904 ansible: vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1777689](show_bug.cgi?id=1777689 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14904 ansible: vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone [fedora-all]")] Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1777688](show_bug.cgi?id=1777688 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-14904 ansible: vulnerability in solaris_zone module via crafted solaris zone [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c6)  Borja Tarraso    2019-12-04 12:06:49 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Currently, there is no mitigation for this issue.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1776944#c11)  Borja Tarraso    2020-01-02 14:04:14 UTC  ``` Statement:  Because a flaw exploit would depend on the use of Solaris and Red Hat does not support RHOSP on Solaris, the RHOSP Ansible package will not be updated at this time.

# CVE-2019-14904

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14902.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14905.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14904 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14904)

#### Description

A flaw was found in the solaris\_zone module from the Ansible Community modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host. Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are affected.
