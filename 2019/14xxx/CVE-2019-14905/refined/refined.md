  "CVE-2019-14905": {
    "description": "A vulnerability was found in Ansible's nxos_file_copy module which can be exploited to copy files to flash or bootflash on NXOS devices. Malicious code could craft the filename parameter to perform OS command injections, potentially leading to a loss of system confidentiality, among other issues.",
