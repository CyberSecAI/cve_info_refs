# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0835

## Atlassian Jira CSRF Protections Bypass Vulnerability

##### September 16, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-14998

### Summary

An exploitable CSRF vulnerability exists in Atlassian Jira 7.6.4. An attacker controlling a subdomain different that the Jira hosting subdomain enables cookie injection and control of the CSRF header token. An attacker can create a cookie and submit CSRF attacks on behalf of a logged-in user to trigger this vulnerability.

### Tested Versions

Atlassian Jira 7.6.4

### Product URLs

<https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira>

### CVSSv3 Score

5.4 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

### CWE

CWE-352 - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

### Details

For a Jira instance hosted at jira.example.com, any other subdomain of example.com may set the `atlassian.xsrf.token` cookie to any value of their choice to enable CSRF attacks. In large organizations with many subdomains, this creates a significant exposure to CSRF attacks.

This attack does require knowing the unique deployment identifier, but this is obtainable by any non-authenticated user that can connect to the Jira instance.

This practice of using a cookie value for CSRF, the Double Submit Cookie pattern, is [known to be insecure](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_%28CSRF%29_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet#Double_Submit_Cookie).

### Exploit Proof-of-Concept

Example of a cookie set by `not-jira.example.com`:

```
atlassian.xsrf.token=A3D2-4M23-294Z-ABCE|deadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef|lin;
                     Path=/secure/; Domain=.example.com; Secure

```

Subsequent CSRF attacks to `jira.example.com/secure/...` will be able to set the `atl_token` value to the now-known cookie value and successfully bypass CSRF protections.

### Timeline

2019-05-14 - Vendor Disclosure

2019-09-09 - Vendor Patched

2019-09-16 - Public Release
