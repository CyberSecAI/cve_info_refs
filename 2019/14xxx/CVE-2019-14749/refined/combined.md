# osTicket 1.12 - Formula Injection

# Exploit Title: osTicket-v1.12 Formula Injection
# Vendor Homepage: https://osticket.com/
# Software Link: https://osticket.com/download/

# CVE: CVE-2019-14749

1. Description

An issue was discovered in osTicket before 1.10.7 and 1.12.x before 1.12.1.
CSV (aka Formula) injection exists in the export spreadsheets
functionality. These spreadsheets are generated dynamically from
unvalidated or unfiltered user input in the Name and Internal Notes fields
in the Users tab, and the Issue Summary field in the tickets tab. This
allows other agents to download data in a .csv file format or .xls file
format. This is used as input for spreadsheet applications such as Excel
and OpenOffice Calc, resulting in a situation where cells in the
spreadsheets can contain input from an untrusted source. As a result, the
end user who is accessing the exported spreadsheet can be affected.

https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14749

2. Proof of Concept

Steps to Reproduce:
- Login as an agent and under the "Users" section create a new user.
- Insert the crafted payload of Formula Injection into "Name" and "Internal
Notes" field.
- Login as another agent and under the Users tab, click on export and then
save the ".csv" file.
- It is observed that the payload gets executed in excel and this leads to
remote code execution.
- Not just an agent, even a non-agent user has the option to edit his name
where he can insert the malicious payload of Formula Injection.
- The application does not sanitize the inputs here due to which when the
agent clicks on export the payload gets executed.
-The same issue persisted in the "Issue Summary" field in the tickets tab.

3. Reference

https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/commit/99818486c5b1d8aa445cee232825418d6834f249
https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.12.1
https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/releases/tag/v1.10.7

4. Solution

The vulnerability has been patched by the vendor in the next release which
is osTicket v1.10.7.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

security: CSV Formula Injection

```
This addresses a security issue discovered by Aishwarya Iyer where a User
can change their Full Name to a windows formula and when an Agent exports a
list of Users containing said User and opens the export file, the formula
will be executed on their computer (if it's windows of course). This adds a
new validator called `is_formula()` to all text fields disallowing the use
of the following characters `= + - @` at the beginning of text. This should
mitigate CSV Formula injections for any text field that allows user-input in
the system. To further prevent CSV Formula injections this adds an escape
mechanism to the Exporter that will escape any content matching the formula
regex with a single quote (as mentioned in many posts about this subject).
