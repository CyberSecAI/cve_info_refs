Package        : libapache2-mod-auth-openidc
Version        : 2.1.6-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-14857 CVE-2019-20479 CVE-2019-1010247

```
Several issues have been found in libapache2-mod-auth-openidc, the OpenID
Connect authentication module for the Apache HTTP server.
```

CVE-2019-14857

    Insufficient validation of URLs leads to an Open Redirect
    vulnerability. An attacker may trick a victim into providing
    credentials for an OpenID provider by forwarding the request to an
    illegitimate website.

CVE-2019-20479

    Due to insufficient validatation of URLs an Open Redirect
    vulnerability for URLs beginning with a slash and backslash could be
    abused.

CVE-2019-1010247

    The OIDCRedirectURI page contains generated JavaScript code that uses
    a poll parameter as a string variable, thus might contain additional
    JavaScript code. This might result in Criss-Site Scripting (XSS).

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.1.6-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-openidc packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-10 23:17:13 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.0.1. An open redirect issue exists in URLs with trailing slashes similar to [CVE-2019-3877](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-3877) in mod_auth_mellon.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/commit/5c15dfb08106c2451c2c44ce7ace6813c216ba75> <https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/commit/ce37080c6aea30aabae8b4a9b4eea7808445cc8e> <https://github.com/zmartzone/mod_auth_openidc/pull/451>  References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mod_auth_openidc/boy1Ba3Gdk4>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-10 23:17:37 UTC  ``` Created mod_auth_openidc tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1760614](show_bug.cgi?id=1760614 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14857 mod_auth_openidc: Open redirect in logout url when using URLs with backslashes [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c5)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-19 20:12:47 UTC  ``` The version of mod_auth_openidc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not contain the patched code, however due to a missing check, this issue does not manifest as an Open Redirect flaw, but it triggers a NULL pointer dereference while parsing the logout URL. For this reason, the only impact on RHEL 7 is to Availability, because the httpd process would die, even though others can take other requests.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c6)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-19 20:22:55 UTC  ``` Function oidc_handle_logout() in mod_auth_openidc.c takes care of handling requests like `<https://server/redirect_uri?logout>=<redirect-url>` and it uses function oidc_validate_post_logout_url() to validate the <redirect-url> (in some older versions of mod_auth_openidc the check is performed in the function oidc_handle_logout() itself). The checks are done by first parsing the URL with apr_uri_parse() and then by looking at the parsed values. However, some URLs may be incorrectly parsed by apr_uri_parse() and still be correctly used by browsers.  A remote attacker may use this flaw to trick a victim user into visiting a trusted vulnerable web site which, when handling a specially crafted URL, would redirect the victim to another malicious URL, possibly performing other kinds of attacks.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c7)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-20 08:04:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  It is not possible to reproduce the open redirect vulnerability in the versions of mod_auth_openidc as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as a missing check makes the process crash, due to a NULL pointer dereference, instead of letting it continue with an invalid URL.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c9)  Jakub Hrozek    2020-02-20 17:18:13 UTC  ``` (In reply to Riccardo Schirone from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c7)) > Statement: >  > It is not possible to reproduce the open redirect vulnerability in the > versions of mod_auth_openidc as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as a > missing check makes the process crash, due to a NULL pointer dereference, > instead of letting it continue with an invalid URL.  Thank you for the careful testing. Would you say that the crash constitutes a DoS instead?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c10)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-02-21 13:21:54 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c9): > (In reply to Riccardo Schirone from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c7)) > > Statement: > >  > > It is not possible to reproduce the open redirect vulnerability in the > > versions of mod_auth_openidc as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, as a > > missing check makes the process crash, due to a NULL pointer dereference, > > instead of letting it continue with an invalid URL. >  > Thank you for the careful testing. Would you say that the crash constitutes > a DoS instead?  I set the CVSS for rhel-7/mod_auth_openidc to 5.8/CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L, which means Availability Impact is set to Low. The httpd server indeed crashes, but the parent httpd process does not and it just spawns new httpd children processes. I would say you could have a Denial of Service if you keep crashing the server very quickly, but I believe it is still Low impact.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-07-21 14:47:06 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:3032 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:3032](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A3032)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1760613#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-07-21 19:27:48 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

### @oss-aimoto **[oss-aimoto](/oss-aimoto)** commented [Oct 3, 2019](#issue-501880956)

Fix open redirect to the following cases.

```
http://rp.example.co.jp/oidc/redirect_uri?logout=///fishing-site.example.com/logout.html

```

FYI.

When the response HTTP header is 'Location: ///fishing-site.example.com/logout.html', the browser redirects to 'fishing-site.example.com'

In the following cases, hostname check works

```
http://rp.example.co.jp/oidc/redirect_uri?logout=//fishing-site.example.com/logout.html

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
