Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-14857:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient validation of URLs within the `mod_auth_openidc` module when handling logout redirects. Specifically, the module did not properly handle URLs with leading slashes (`/`) or backslashes (`\`).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Open Redirect:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to craft a malicious URL, that when processed by `mod_auth_openidc`, redirects the user to an arbitrary, attacker-controlled website. This bypasses the module's intended hostname validation.
- **Malformed URL parsing:** The module's URL parsing logic, particularly in `apr_uri_parse()`, was not robust enough to handle URLs with leading slashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** An attacker can trick a user into visiting a legitimate website that uses `mod_auth_openidc`, and then redirect them to a malicious website designed to steal credentials or install malware.
- In some cases, a NULL pointer dereference may occur in RHEL7 due to a missing check, causing a crash of the httpd process, leading to a potential denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a URL that includes the logout parameter with a malicious redirect URL.
- This URL is then presented to a victim who visits the vulnerable website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious redirect target.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the victim or the server, as the attack is performed via the victim's browser

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability was located in the `oidc_validate_post_logout_url()` function within `src/mod_auth_openidc.c`.
- The fix involved improving URL validation, especially for URLs with leading slashes.
- The fix also introduced an additional check `(uri.hostname == NULL) && (strstr(url, "/") != url)` to handle relative paths.
- The vulnerability is described in the context of a logout redirect and an inadequate parsing of the redirect URL.

**Additional Information:**
- The fix was implemented in `mod_auth_openidc` version 2.4.0.1.
- Red Hat identified that the issue could result in a NULL pointer dereference in RHEL7 leading to a denial of service and rated the impact as Low.
- The issue was fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHSA-2020:3032 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 via RHSA-2020:3970.
- Debian LTS also addressed the issue with DLA-2298-1 in version 2.1.6-1+deb9u1.
- The vulnerability can be exploited when the mod_auth_openidc module is configured to handle logout redirects, and a crafted URL is used to redirect the victim user to a different domain.

In summary, CVE-2019-14857 is an open redirect vulnerability due to insufficient URL validation in `mod_auth_openidc`'s logout functionality. It allows attackers to redirect users to malicious sites, potentially leading to credential theft or malware installation.
