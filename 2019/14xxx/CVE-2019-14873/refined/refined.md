```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The __multadd function in newlib's libc/stdlib/mprec.c uses Balloc to allocate a big integer without checking if the allocation succeeded. The subsequent Bcopy operation will cause a null pointer dereference if Balloc returns NULL.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "NULL pointer dereference"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A NULL pointer dereference can occur, which would likely cause a crash. If the device vector table is mapped at address 0x0, it may also allow to execute code referenced through a function pointer found in the first few bytes of memory or overwrite an interrupt handler.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by a call to the __multadd function, which occurs during floating-point operations. The device must enter a low memory condition to trigger the bug. Triggering a floating-point operation in a low memory scenario will result in the crash.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to cause a low memory condition and trigger the vulnerable function. This would typically require some control over the application or the device's state."
