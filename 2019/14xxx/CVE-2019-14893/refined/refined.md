    "summary": "The vulnerability is a flaw in FasterXML jackson-databind that permits polymorphic deserialization of malicious objects using the xalan JNDI gadget. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code by using polymorphic type handling methods such as `enableDefaultTyping()` or when @JsonTypeInfo is using `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS` or in any other way which `ObjectMapper.readValue` might instantiate objects from unsafe sources.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the way FasterXML jackson-databind handles polymorphic deserialization, specifically when used with the xalan JNDI gadget. This allows for the instantiation of malicious objects if the input is not carefully controlled.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Polymorphic deserialization vulnerability",
         "Deserialization of malicious objects",
         "Usage of unsafe sources in ObjectMapper.readValue"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Deserialization from untrusted sources",
        "Exploiting polymorphic type handling methods such as `enableDefaultTyping()`",
        "Using `@JsonTypeInfo` with `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`",
        "Any other way in which `ObjectMapper.readValue` might instantiate objects from unsafe sources"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious object for deserialization that can utilize the xalan JNDI gadget. The attacker can be remote. They must also be able to utilize the vulnerable deserialization methods.",
       "additional_info":"The vulnerability is exploitable when polymorphic type handling methods are enabled or unsafe sources are used with `ObjectMapper.readValue` to instantiate objects, which can cause arbitrary code execution through the xalan JNDI gadget.  Some products may not be vulnerable if polymorphic unmarshaling is not enabled. Red Hat recommends avoiding deserialization from untrusted sources, the use of `enableDefaultTyping()`, or `@JsonTypeInfo` using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS` as mitigation."
