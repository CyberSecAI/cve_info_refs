Version        : 0~20161202.7bbe0b3e-1+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-0161 CVE-2019-14558 CVE-2019-14559 CVE-2019-14562
                 CVE-2019-14563 CVE-2019-14575 CVE-2019-14584 CVE-2019-14586
                 CVE-2019-14587 CVE-2021-28210 CVE-2021-28211
Debian Bug     : 952926 968819 952934 977300

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in edk2, firmware for
virtual machines. Integer and stack overflows and uncontrolled resource
consumption may lead to a denial-of-service or in a worst case scenario,
allow an authenticated local user to potentially enable escalation of
privilege.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0~20161202.7bbe0b3e-1+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your edk2 packages.

For the detailed security status of edk2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/edk2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
