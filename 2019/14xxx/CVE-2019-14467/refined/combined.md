## Description

This is a Polaroid image gallery plugins with the following features:

\* Create sub folders and upload photos to subfolder. Each subfolder represents a separate photo album

\* Must be possible to upload a cover photo for each album

\* Must be possible to add a date, title, and description for each album

\* Facility to add watermark to the images – watermark image must be able to be uploaded to the server. Must be possible to have a unique watermark for each album

\* Must be possible to add a caption for each image

\* On the front end, the cover photo for each album should be displayed on the main gallery page, like a set of polaroids, at different angles

\* Users should be able to view each album by clicking on the cover photo

\* Photos within albums should also be displayed like polaroids (i.e. like holiday snaps, not just in a straight line)

\* Photos can be enlarged by clicking on them

\* an icon or set of icons on each photo that allows you to share that photo on facebook and other social media sites or email it to someone

It would be ideal if this photo gallery worked in a similar way to Yootheme’s WordPress widgetkit Gallery http://www.yootheme.com/demo/themes/wordpress/2012/sync/?page\_id=112 (see polaroid example)
