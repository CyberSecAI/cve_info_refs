      "source": "seclists.org_13c83cba_20250121_003535.html",
      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The WordPress Plugin Social Photo Gallery 1.0 does not validate file extensions during the upload of album cover photos.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Missing file extension validation",
          "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can upload and execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.",
        "attackVectors": "The attacker uploads a malicious PHP file disguised as a cover photo.",
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create an album in the vulnerable WordPress plugin.",
         "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user creates a new album and uploads a malicious PHP file as the cover photo. The lack of file extension validation allows the PHP file to be stored and subsequently executed by accessing its URL. An example payload is provided: `<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>` which allows execution of arbitrary commands by using `cmd` GET parameter. The advisory also mentions that the vendor did not respond to notifications and that the fix is to only allow Digital Image Files: TIFF, JPEG, GIF, PNG."
