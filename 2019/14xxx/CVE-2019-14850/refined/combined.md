| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c0)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-01 01:20:33 UTC  ``` An attacker, by connecting to nbdkit’s TCP port, is able to make the current plugin’s .open() callback run.  For some plugins this callback does a considerable amount of work, for example connecting to a remote machine (nbdkit-ssh-plugin) or launching a small VM (nbdkit-guestfs-plugin).  Thus for a small amount of work done by the attacker (opening many TCP connections but not sending any data), a large amount of work is done by nbdkit (eg. making many full ssh connections to a remote machine or launching hundreds of VMs).  A related problem is that if nbdkit is configured to use TLS for client authentication, even clients which are not authorized are able to attack nbdkit in this way because all they have to do is open a TCP connection.  Mitigating this is that the current plugin is NOT selected by the attacker, but is part of the server configuration.  Therefore the effectiveness of the attack depends on the particular configuration.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c1)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-01 01:20:39 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Richard W. M. Jones (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c2)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-01 01:20:42 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.redhat.com/archives/libguestfs/2019-September/msg00084.html>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c3)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-01 01:20:46 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  This attack is only possible if nbdkit is configured with a plugin that does a lot of work in its initial .open() callback. Some examples that do a lot of work are nbdkit-ssh-plugin and nbdkit-guestfs-plugin. The nbdkit-memory-plugin is an example that does very little work, and thus is not subject to this vulnerability.  Only attackers that can connect to the nbdkit service can exploit this vulnerability. If nbdkit is not exposed over TCP (eg, nbdkit -U), or is bound only to a private network interface, or is protected by firewall rules, the attack surface is correspondingly limited.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c5)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-01 01:23:16 UTC  ``` Created nbdkit tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1757265](show_bug.cgi?id=1757265 "CLOSED WONTFIX - CVE-2019-14850 nbdkit: denial of service due to premature opening of back-end connection [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1757264](show_bug.cgi?id=1757264 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-14850 nbdkit: denial of service due to premature opening of back-end connection [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c7)  Doran Moppert    2019-10-01 01:26:38 UTC  ``` NOTE:  the upstream patches for this issue introduced another flaw, of higher severity than this one ([bug 1757259](show_bug.cgi?id=1757259 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2019-14851 nbdkit: assertion failure by issuing commands in the wrong order")).

Red Hat Virtualization 4.2 EUS includes a vulnerable version of nbdkit, however it is used only on the Hypervisor with a Unix domain socket, so this vulnerability is not exposed to untrusted users.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-03-31 19:29:23 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2020:1167 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1167](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1167)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1757258#c13)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-03-31 22:35:29 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
