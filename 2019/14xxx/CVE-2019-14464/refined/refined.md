Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-14464:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow found in the `XMFile::read` function, specifically within the `XMFile.cpp` file of the MilkyTracker software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The `XMFile::read` function does not properly validate the size of data being read from a file, leading to a write beyond the allocated memory buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The immediate impact is a crash of the MilkyTracker application due to the memory corruption caused by the overflow.
*   **Arbitrary code execution (Potential):** The Ubuntu Security Notice states "If a user were tricked into opening a malicious file, an attacker could cause MilkyTracker to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code."  While not explicitly stated in the other sources, heap-based buffer overflows can often lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited carefully, as an attacker can overwrite critical program data or code on the heap.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Maliciously crafted module files:** The primary attack vector is through opening a specially crafted module file (e.g., S3M, XM format) designed to trigger the buffer overflow.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to be tricked into opening a malicious file with MilkyTracker.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create malicious module files:** An attacker needs to be able to generate a module file with specific properties that cause the overflow in the `XMFile::read` function when parsed by MilkyTracker.
*   **Social engineering (or similar):**  The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious file with MilkyTracker.

**Additional Technical Details**

*   The overflow occurs in `XMFile.cpp` at line 404 during the `fread` operation.
*   The provided crash report from the github issue shows the crash occurs in `LoaderS3M::load` called from `XModule::loadModule` after loading an S3M file.
*   The issue was discovered by fuzzing with American Fuzzy Lop (AFL).
*   The vulnerable code exists within the milkyplay library of MilkyTracker.

The provided information is consistent with the official CVE description in that it describes a heap-based buffer overflow in `XMFile::read`. The additional information provides the file and line number where the vulnerability is located, the method of discovery (fuzzing), and the type of file that triggers the vulnerability (S3M). It also points out that this vulnerability is present in the milkyplay component of the software.
