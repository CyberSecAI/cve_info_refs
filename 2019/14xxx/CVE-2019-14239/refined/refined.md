The provided content relates to CVE-2019-14239.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the insufficient protection offered by Execute-Only Memory (XOM) implementations in microcontrollers. Despite restricting read access to code in XOM, shared resources like the CPU and SRAM allow an attacker to infer instruction execution through observed state transitions. Additionally, implementation flaws in some devices allow direct read-out of protected code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Conceptual weakness of XOM:** XOM implementations rely on preventing read access but fail to isolate the execution of protected code from shared resources. This allows an attacker to monitor CPU registers and SRAM content to infer executed instructions.
2.  **Lack of debug restrictions:** Some devices do not restrict single-stepping or other debug features when executing code in XOM, which makes it easy to observe system state changes.
3. **Implementation Flaws:**
   - On STM32F7 devices, data transfers initiated by the AHB Access Port (AHB-AP) via the ITCM bus are not correctly blocked, allowing read-out of protected code through the debug interface.
   - On Kinetis devices, all load instructions inside the XOM region can read from it, allowing the execution of gadgets to leak code by reading to registers.
   - On MSP432P4 devices, while load operations from XOM are initially disabled, a key can be written to enable them via a gadget which can then be used to extract code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation allows an adversary to recover or directly read-out firmware protected by XOM. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive intellectual property (IP), reverse engineering of proprietary algorithms, and potential modification of the protected firmware.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Instruction Recovery via State Observation:** The adversary executes code in XOM and uses the microcontroller's debug capabilities (or interrupt-driven approach) to observe changes in CPU registers and SRAM content before and after executing target instructions. This process can be automated to recover the protected instructions.
2.  **Direct Read-Out:** Specific implementation flaws can be exploited to bypass the XOM read-out restrictions and directly access the protected code using gadgets.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Physical access** to the microcontroller is required to use the debug interface.
2.  **Ability to execute code** on the target device, either through debug interface or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject and execute malicious code.
3.  **Privileged code execution** is needed to observe system state changes.
4. **For some devices, a debug probe** is needed to interact with the debug interface.
