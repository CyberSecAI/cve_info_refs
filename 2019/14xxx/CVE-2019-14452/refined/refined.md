{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of file paths extracted from ZIP archives. Specifically, the software fails to prevent directory traversal attacks, where a malicious archive contains file paths with `../` sequences, which allow writing files outside of the intended target directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Zip Slip"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem, which may lead to remote access or arbitrary code execution, depending on the overwritten files.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious user crafts a ZIP archive (EPUB file, plugin zip, etc.) with file paths containing `../` sequences.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malformed ZIP archive and trick a user into opening/processing the file."
