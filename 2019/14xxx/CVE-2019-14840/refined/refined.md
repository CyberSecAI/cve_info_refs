```
{
  "Root cause": "The `autocomplete` attribute was not set to `off` for sensitive fields like password fields in the login form.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": "The absence of `autocomplete=\"off\"` on sensitive form fields allows browsers to save and autofill user credentials, potentially exposing them to unauthorized access if the system is compromised or if the user's browser is accessed by an attacker.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could gain unauthorized access to user credentials if they have access to the user's browser or if the saved credentials are leaked via browser vulnerabilities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves exploiting the browser's autofill functionality when the `autocomplete` attribute is not properly configured. An attacker with physical access to a machine or through malware on the users machine can use this. ",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the user's browser where the login credentials have been saved or exploit vulnerabilities to obtain saved credentials."
