{
  "CVE-2019-14494": {
    "Description": "A divide-by-zero error was found in the way Poppler handled certain PDF files, specifically within the `SplashOutputDev::tilingPatternFill` function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw by providing a malicious PDF file that, when processed by an application linked to Poppler, would crash the application causing a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for zero dimensions before performing a division operation within the `SplashOutputDev::tilingPatternFill` function, leading to a divide-by-zero error.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Divide-by-zero",
       "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit leads to a crash of the application processing the malicious PDF file, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted PDF file that triggers the vulnerable code path within the `SplashOutputDev::tilingPatternFill` function.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to submit or make the application process a malicious PDF file."
