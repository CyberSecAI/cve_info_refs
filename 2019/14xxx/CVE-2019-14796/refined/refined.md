### CVE-2019-14796

The provided content describes an Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Woocommerce Products Price Bulk Edit" WordPress plugin.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin registers the function `wppbe_update_options()` to be accessible to anyone logged in to WordPress, including customers. This function updates the pluginâ€™s settings without sanitizing or validating the input value `$_POST['show_products_page_limit']`. The value is then output without being escaped on the plugin's admin page.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Authenticated Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Lack of input sanitization/validation
    *   Missing capabilities check
    *   Missing CSRF protection
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the plugin settings. When an administrator visits the plugin's admin page, the injected code will be executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to perform administrative actions, steal sensitive information, or compromise the website.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request to the `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=update_options` endpoint with a payload in the `show_products_page_limit` parameter.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have a valid WordPress account on the target site. Since WooCommerce normally creates accounts for customers, this is a low barrier to entry.

The provided Proof of Concept demonstrates how to inject JavaScript code that displays the site's cookies:

```html
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=update_options" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="show_products_page_limit" value='1"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
