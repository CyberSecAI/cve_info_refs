## CVE-2019-14859

The provided documents describe a vulnerability in the `python-ecdsa` library before version 0.13.3 related to improper verification of cryptographic signatures.

**Root Cause:** The `python-ecdsa` library does not correctly verify whether signatures use DER encoding.

**Vulnerability:** Insufficient checks of DER encoding in ECDSA signatures leading to signature malleability.

**Impact:**

*   A malformed signature could be accepted.
*   An attacker could use a malleable signature to create false transactions, potentially leading to integrity and confidentiality issues depending on the application using the library.

**Attack Vector:** An attacker could craft a malformed ECDSA signature that, due to the lack of proper DER encoding verification, is accepted as valid.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to create or manipulate ECDSA signatures. The attacker does not require any privileges or user interaction. The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
