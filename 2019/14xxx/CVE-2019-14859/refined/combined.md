| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1760843#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-11 13:09:02 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in python-ecdsa before 0.13.3. The library is not verifying if the signatures actually use DER encoding for the signatures. This makes the signatures malleable and exposes use cases that further sign the signatures. In particular bitcoin.   Upstream issue:  <https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa/issues/114>  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa/pull/115> <https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa/pull/124>  References:  <https://en.bitcoinwiki.org/wiki/Transaction_Malleability>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1760843#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-11 13:09:23 UTC  ``` Created python-ecdsa tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-all [[bug 1760845](show_bug.cgi?id=1760845 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14859 python-ecdsa: DER encoding is not being verified in signatures [epel-all]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1760844](show_bug.cgi?id=1760844 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14859 python-ecdsa: DER encoding is not being veryfied in signatures [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1760843#c4)  Summer Long    2019-10-30 03:55:49 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://github.com/warner/python-ecdsa/releases/tag/python-ecdsa-0.13.3> <https://pypi.org/project/ecdsa/0.13.3/>   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1760843#c14)  Doran Moppert    2021-03-04 07:04:49 UTC  ``` Statement:  Although Red Hat OpenStack Platform ships the flawed code, RHOSP does not actually use python-ecdsa's functionality. As such, Red Hat OpenStack Platform will not be providing a fix for python-ecdsa at this time.  Red Hat CloudForms 5.9, 5.10 and 5.11 is not affected as these versions no longer ship the python-ecdsa library. Only CloudForms 5.8, which is now EOL, delivered the python-ecdsa library.  Current releases of Red Hat Virtualization Manager no longer include python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.  Current releases of Red Hat Satellite no longer include python-ecdsa as a dependency.  While it remains available in repositories as a legacy dependency, it is not installed by default and its use is not recommended.   ```  [Comment 28](show_bug.cgi?id=1760843#c28)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-11-16 14:07:42 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Satellite 6.10 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2021:4702 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:4702](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A4702)   ``` |  |

## Package

pip

ecdsa
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 0.13.3

## Patched versions

0.13.3

## Description

## possible DoS in signature verification and signature malleability

### Impact

Code using `VerifyingKey.verify()` and `VerifyingKey.verify_digest()` may receive exceptions other than the documented `BadSignatureError` when signatures are malformed. If those other exceptions are not caught, they may lead to program termination and thus Denial of Service

Code using `VerifyingKey.verify()` and `VerifyingKey.verify_digest()` with `sigdecode` option using `ecdsa.util.sigdecode_der` will accept signatures even if they are not properly formatted DER. This makes the signatures malleable. It impacts only applications that later sign the signatures or verify signatures of signatures, e.g. Bitcoin.

All versions between 0.5 and 0.13.2 (inclusive) are thought to be vulnerable. Code before 0.5 may be vulnerable but didn't receive extended analysis to rule this issue out.

### Patches

The patches have been merged to `master` branch in [tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa#115](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa/pull/115).

The backported patches for a release in the 0.13 branch are in [tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa#124](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa/pull/124)

They are part of the 0.13.3 release.

There are no plans to backport them to earlier releases.

### Workarounds

It may be possible to prevent the Denial of Service by catching also `UnexpectedDER`, `IndexError` and `AssertionError` exceptions. That list hasn't been verified to be complete though. If those exceptions are raised, the signature verification process should consider the signature to be invalid.

To remediate signature malleability and the Denial of Service vulnerability, it may be possible to first verify that the signature is properly DER formatted ECDSA-Sig-Value, as defined in [RFC3279](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3279), before passing it to `verify()` or `verify_digest()` methods. If the signature is determined to not follow the DER or encode a different structure, the signature verification process should consider the signature to be invalid.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

## Description

![@tomato42](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/618246?v=4&size=48)[tomato42](https://github.com/tomato42)opened [on Sep 25, 2019](https://github.com/tlsfuzzer/python-ecdsa/issues/114#issue-498467334)

When the DER signature is malformed, the `VerifyingKey.verify(sigdecode=sigdecode_der)` raises unexpected exceptions and in some cases does not raise any exception.

`UnexpectedDER`, `IndexError` and `AssertionError` are raised in addition to `BadSignatureError`, at the same time flipping the 4th or 6th least significant bit of 2nd byte of a NIST521p signature does not cause it to be rejected (the DER encoding is strict, and every value has one defined encoding, any other encoding is invalid and needs to be rejected)

## Description

A flaw was found in all python-ecdsa versions before 0.13.3, where it did not correctly verify whether signatures used DER encoding. Without this verification, a malformed signature could be accepted, making the signature malleable. Without proper verification, an attacker could use a malleable signature to create false transactions.

This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
