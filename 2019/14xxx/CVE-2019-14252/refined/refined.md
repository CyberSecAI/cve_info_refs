The provided content is a security advisory detailing an exploit chain in Publisure Hybrid mail. This advisory outlines three vulnerabilities, one of which is identified as CVE-2019-14252.

**CVE-2019-14252 Details:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the "adminCons.php" form.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Lack of file type validation when uploading files.
    *   The ability to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via the upload form.
    *   The uploaded malicious PHP file is stored within "/AdminDir/Templates" folder, even when the file is removed from "adminCons.php" view, which provides a mechanism for hiding the malicious file.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Network-based attack via the "adminCons.php" form.
    *   Exploitation requires administrator level access to the application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have successfully gained administrator access. This is achieved using the other vulnerabilities in the exploit chain detailed in the advisory.

**Exploit Chain Summary**

The advisory describes an exploit chain involving three vulnerabilities:

1.  **Improper access control (CVE-2019-14253):** Allows unauthenticated access to PHP forms in the `/AdminDir` folder.
2.  **SQL injection (CVE-2019-14254):** Exploitable via the bypassed authentication, enabling access to the database and modification of user privileges.
3.  **Unrestricted file upload RCE (CVE-2019-14252):** Once admin access is gained, the attacker can upload a PHP backdoor using "adminCons.php," leading to RCE.
