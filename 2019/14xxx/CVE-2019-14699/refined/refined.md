RELATED: CVE-2019-14699
  
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a path traversal issue in the HTTPD web server. The filename specified in the "TZ" parameter is accessed with a substantial delay if that file exists.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   Path Traversal vulnerability allowing an attacker to access files on the device file system.
    *   Exposure of internal file system via the TZ parameter.
    *   Lack of input validation for the "TZ" parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Information Disclosure: An attacker can determine if arbitrary files exist on the device filesystem by observing the delay.
    *   Denial of Service: An attacker can cause a denial of service by targeting special files such as /dev/random, leading to resource exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
    *   Remote attack via HTTP requests to the web server on port 80.
    *   The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request containing the "TZ" parameter with a file path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable device web server.
    *   No authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
