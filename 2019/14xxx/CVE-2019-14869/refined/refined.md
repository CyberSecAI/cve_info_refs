{
  "CVE-2019-14869": {
    "Description": "The `.charkeys` procedure in Ghostscript did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. An attacker could abuse this flaw by creating a specially crafted PostScript file that could escalate privileges within Ghostscript and access files outside of restricted areas or execute commands.",
    "Root cause": "The `.charkeys` method was vulnerable due to the presence of the unprotected `.forceput` operator (or `superexec` in older versions), which could be retrieved via manipulation of the error handler.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper restriction of privileged calls within the `.charkeys` method.",
      "Insecure access to privileged operators (`.forceput` or `superexec`).",
      "Bypass of `-dSAFER` restrictions using crafted PostScript code.",
      "Stack overflow to retrieve `.forceput`"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of Ghostscript, access files outside of the restricted area, or cause a denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted PostScript files.",
      "Manipulation of the error handler in PostScript.",
	  "Using stack overflow to retrieve the privileged operator `.forceput`."
    ],
    "Attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PostScript file to the Ghostscript interpreter. No authentication is needed, user interaction is required."
