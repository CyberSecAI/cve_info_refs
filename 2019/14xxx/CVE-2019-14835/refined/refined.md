Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-14835:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `vhost/vhost_net` kernel module, which serves as a virtio network backend.
- Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper bounds checking when logging buffer descriptors during live migrations of virtual machines.
- During migration, QEMU needs information about dirty pages, which the `vhost/vhost_net` module records in a kernel buffer. However, the module does not validate the size of the log buffer, allowing an attacker to overflow it.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `get_indirect` function (drivers/vhost/vhost.c) and possibly `vhost_get_vq_desc` within the vhost/vhost_net module, due to a lack of bounds checking on the log buffer.
- **Uncontrolled length:** The length of the log buffer is not verified against the size of the allocated buffer and can be controlled from the VM guest using an indirect descriptor.
- **Missing bounds check:** The code fails to check if the number of descriptors read from the indirect table exceeds the allocated buffer size.
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafted indirect descriptor tables provided by the VM guest, which result in an excessive number of descriptors being written to the log buffer.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Guest to Host Kernel Escape:** A privileged user within a VM can exploit this vulnerability to achieve a kernel escape on the host system.
- **Host Kernel Crash:** Overwriting of kernel memory can lead to a denial of service (host kernel crash).
- **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The ability to overwrite parts of the host kernel memory can lead to escalation of privileges.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

- The attack is triggered during the live migration of a virtual machine.
- The attacker needs control of the guest VM and must be able to create a specifically crafted virtio-net indirect descriptor table within the guest.
- The attacker needs to trigger or wait for a live migration to occur to trigger the vulnerability. This can be achieved through increased host workload or a memory leak within the VM to trigger a migration event, depending on the specific vendor's migration policy

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Privileged access** within the guest VM, specifically the ability to modify virtio-net drivers.
- The ability to trigger live migration or force it by causing high resource utilization on the host via workload increase, memory leak, or vendor-specific migration policies.
- Network connectivity to the host, usually through the virtio networking driver to interact with the hypervisor.

**Additional Notes (from the provided content):**

- The vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel since version 2.6.34 and was fixed in version 5.3.
- The upstream patch to fix the vulnerability is available: [<https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/060423bfdee3f8bc6e2c1bac97de24d5415e2bc4>](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/060423bfdee3f8bc6e2c1bac97de24d5415e2bc4)
- A patch has been provided that modifies the guest kernel to trigger the overflow.
- Red Hat and Debian have released security advisories for their products, with patches available.
- Mitigation can be achieved by disabling vhost-net, restricting access to `/dev/kvm`, or disabling guest live migrations.
- Specific Red Hat products affected are listed in RHSA advisories, along with specific fixed versions for kernel packages for various RHEL versions.
- Slackware 14.2 kernel is also affected and was fixed in version 4.4.193.
- OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 and 15.1 kernels are also affected and were fixed with the release of openSUSE-SU-2019:2173-1 and openSUSE-SU-2019:2181-1 respectively.
- A reproducer method with Ubuntu and `virt-manager` to trigger the vulnerability is available.
