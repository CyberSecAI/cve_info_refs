```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The application fails to sanitize user input on the `desktop_url` parameter of the `error-not-supported-platform.html` page and reflects the input directly in the HTTP response.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: Reflected XSS impact can range from web defacement to stealing user info and full account takeover.
- Attack vectors: Attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `desktop_url` parameter of a URL, and sends the link to the victim. When the victim clicks the link, the malicious payload is executed in the victimâ€™s browser.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and send it to the victim. The victim needs to click on the crafted link.
