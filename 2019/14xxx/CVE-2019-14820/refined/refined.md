- Several Red Hat products were affected and subsequently patched, including Red Hat Single Sign-On and Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform.
- Some products like Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes Spring Boot and Red Hat Mobile Application Platform were noted as being out of security support scope for this vulnerability initially but Red Hat Openshift Application Runtimes were later patched.
