Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14540:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a polymorphic typing issue within the `FasterXML jackson-databind` library. Specifically, it involves the improper handling of type information during deserialization when used in conjunction with the class `com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig`. This allows an attacker to instantiate and manipulate objects of arbitrary classes.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Polymorphic Deserialization:** The vulnerability stems from the way Jackson handles polymorphic deserialization, particularly when type information is derived from the input data itself.
- **Unsafe Class Instantiation:** When `enableDefaultTyping()` is enabled or `@JsonTypeInfo` is used with `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`, the library can instantiate arbitrary classes based on attacker-controlled type identifiers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server by providing a specially crafted JSON payload containing malicious gadget classes that are present in the application's classpath.
- **Data Disclosure**: Attackers may potentially read files on the server by using specific gadget classes.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker may cause a DoS by exploiting a gadget to crash or hang a service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious JSON Payload:** The primary attack vector involves sending a crafted JSON payload to the server that is vulnerable to deserialization using `jackson-databind`. This payload contains type information that causes the library to instantiate and manipulate attacker-controlled objects.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Untrusted JSON Source:** The attacker must be able to provide a JSON payload to the vulnerable application and influence how it is deserialized. This typically involves an exposed API endpoint that parses user-supplied JSON data.
- **Knowledge of Gadget Classes**: The attacker needs to know of "gadget" classes that are available in the application classpath in order to perform malicious operations.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE Description):**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through multiple ways to enable polymorphic typing, namely `enableDefaultTyping()`, `@JsonTypeInfo` with `Id.CLASS` or `Id.MINIMAL_CLASS`, or other ways that let `ObjectMapper.readValue` instantiate from unsafe sources.
- A mitigation approach is to use per-property explicit polymorphic handling configuration (e.g. `@JsonTypeInfo` for specific properties) rather than enabling default typing globally.
- The vulnerability specifically relates to the `HikariConfig` class via the `HikariDataSource`.
- Patches involve blocking usage of known "gadget" classes
- Red Hat also mentions specific conditions needed for an exploit:
    - Deserialization from sources you do not control
    - use of `enableDefaultTyping()`
     - use of `@JsonTypeInfo using `id.CLASS` or `id.MINIMAL_CLASS`

**Affected Versions:**
The vulnerability affects jackson-databind versions:

*   < 2.9.10
*   < 2.8.11.5
*   < 2.6.7.3

This CVE does NOT affect versions 2.10.0 and later because they addressed the vulnerability.

**Mitigation:**
Upgrading the `jackson-databind` library to a patched version (2.9.10, 2.8.11.5, or 2.6.7.3 and later) is recommended to mitigate the vulnerability. Additionally, it is advised to avoid enabling polymorphic deserialization globally (e.g. using enableDefaultTyping()) and instead explicitly declare types with the `@JsonTypeInfo` annotation, and avoid using untyped Object fields when dealing with untrusted JSON sources.
