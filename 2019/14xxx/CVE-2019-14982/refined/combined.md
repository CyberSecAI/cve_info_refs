## Description

![@boo0m](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17027039?u=09a97e3687e298373f63e549c6fff4588aaafc46&v=4&size=48)[boo0m](https://github.com/boo0m)opened [on Jul 15, 2019](https://github.com/Exiv2/exiv2/issues/960#issue-467920688)

**Describe the bug**

I found a buffer overflow bugs in exiv2/src/webpimage.cpp:837 due to integer overflow.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behaviour:

exiv2/build/bin/exiv2 exiv2\_getHeaderOffset.poc

**Expected behavior**

In Exiv2::WebPImage::getHeaderOffset, integer overflow occurs when data\_size is less than header\_size, and it will cause buffer overflow in '&data[i]'.
