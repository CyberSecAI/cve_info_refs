CVE ID: CVE-2019-14363
The provided content describes a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Netgear WNDR3400v3 routers, specifically within the `ssdp_http_method_check` function of the `upnpd` binary.

Vulnerability Details:
- Root Cause: A stack-based buffer overflow exists in the `ssdp_http_method_check` function in the `upnpd` binary.
- Weakness: Sending a crafted UPnP SSDP packet allows overwriting the `$ra` register.
- Impact: Exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution by overwriting the return address (`$ra`) and using a ROP chain to bypass ASLR.
- Attack Vector: Sending a specially crafted UPnP SSDP packet to port 1900.
- Required Capabilities: Ability to send UDP packets to the router on the local network. The attacker needs to craft a specific SSDP packet with a payload that overflows the buffer.
- ASLR: While the stack employs ASLR, the exploit can bypass this using a ROP chain using static address spaces in libraries like `libc.so.0`, `libnat.so`, and `libcrypt.so.0`.
