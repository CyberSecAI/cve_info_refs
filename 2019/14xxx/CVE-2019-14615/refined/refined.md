Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient control flow within certain data structures of Intel Processors with Intel Processor Graphics during context switches. Specifically, the Linux kernel did not properly clear these data structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Failure to properly clear data structures on context switches leads to the potential for sensitive data to be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker could potentially access sensitive information from other GPU tasks because of the kernel's failure to clear specific data structures.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Local Access:** A local attacker needs to be present on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the affected system.
-   **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to cause the information disclosure.

**Additional Information:**

-   The vulnerability affects multiple Intel processor families, specifically those using Intel Integrated Graphics.
-   The issue is resolved by updating the IntelÂ® Processor Graphics Driver for Windows* and the i915 Linux Driver to the latest versions.
-   The Linux mitigation requires a kernel version of 5.5-rc6 or later or corresponding stable or LTS versions.
-   The Suse content notes that the issue is currently rated as having "moderate" severity.
-   The Ubuntu notices confirm that a local attacker can expose sensitive information.

The provided text also mentions the following:
- CVE-2019-14615 is related to insufficient control flow in certain data structures for some Intel Processors with Intel Processor Graphics
- Local attacker can expose sensitive information.
- There is an incomplete mitigation for platforms using Ivy Bridge, Bay Trail and Haswell processors running Windows. Linux mitigation for these platforms will be in the mainline kernel.
- There are additional advisory notes in the SUSE section related to the kernel-default package, stating that SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux kernel, but declare some bug classes as won't fix.
