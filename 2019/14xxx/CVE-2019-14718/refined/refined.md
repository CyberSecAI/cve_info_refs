- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure Permissions leading to arbitrary command injection and privilege escalation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from insecure permissions within the `svc_netcontrol` component, which allows for arbitrary command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command injection and privilege escalation, potentially allowing an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) to exploit this vulnerability.
