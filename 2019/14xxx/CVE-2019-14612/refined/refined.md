Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-14612:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Out-of-bounds write in the firmware for Intel NUC products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically an out-of-bounds write, meaning that the firmware is writing data to memory locations that it should not be accessing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privilege. This means an attacker could potentially gain higher-level access to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local access.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a privileged user on the target system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is exploitable locally meaning the attacker needs to have access to the system they are trying to exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the firmware of multiple Intel NUC products.
*   The CVSS base score for this vulnerability is 7.5, which is considered high.
* The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`.
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attacker must have local access to the system.
    *  **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** Exploitation requires specialized conditions or is difficult to perform.
    *   **PR:H (Privileges Required: High):** The attacker must have high privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is needed for exploitation.
    *   **S:C (Scope: Changed):**  A successful exploit can impact components beyond the vulnerability's immediate scope.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:H (Integrity: High):** There is a high impact on integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability: High):** There is a high impact on availability.
