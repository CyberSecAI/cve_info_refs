Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-14814:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel does not properly perform bounds checking when processing certain Wi-Fi parameters, specifically related to supported rates.  The driver copies rate information from user space to a kernel buffer without checking if the size of the user-provided data exceeds the size of the kernel buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap overflow:** Due to the missing bounds check, an attacker can supply crafted Wi-Fi parameters that are larger than the intended destination buffer, causing a heap overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of service (system crash):** A heap overflow can overwrite critical kernel data, leading to system instability and a crash.
*   **Arbitrary code execution (possible):**  A heap overflow can potentially be leveraged by a skilled attacker to execute arbitrary code. The provided documents mostly focus on the system crash / DoS, the potential for arbitrary code execution is only speculatively mentioned

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local attacker:**  The attacker must have local access to the system.
*   The vulnerable code path is triggered through the configuration of a Marvell Wi-Fi device via the network configuration subsystem, meaning a local attacker would also need access to the network subsystem in the kernel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Local access to the system.
*   Ability to configure a Marvell Wi-Fi device via the network subsystem. This likely means the attacker needs some level of privileges, possibly CAP_NET_ADMIN, or potentially full administrative privileges..
    
*   Physically proximate attack: some sources say it is a local attack, while others say it is physically proximate (as opposed to remote), implying it can be done from the vicinity of the device over the air.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is located within the `mwifiex` driver, which means that only systems using this driver for a Marvell Wi-Fi device are vulnerable.
*   The provided information indicates that related CVEs (CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816) are associated with other heap overflows in the same Marvell Wi-Fi driver, related to the processing of other Wi-Fi parameters.
* Some sources mention that a patch has been provided to remediate the vulnerability.
* Some sources suggest that the flaw can be triggered by sending a crafted packet via netlink.
* The affected code path is `mwifiex_set_uap_rates()` within `drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/uap_cmd.c`
