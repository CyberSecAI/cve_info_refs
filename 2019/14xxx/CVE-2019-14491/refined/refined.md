Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `cv::predictOrdered<cv::HaarEvaluator>` function, located in `modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The code attempts to access memory outside of the allocated bounds of the `cascadeLeaves` array. This occurs because the index `leafOfs - idx` can become negative and hence a read outside the bounds of allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The out-of-bounds read leads to a crash, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by processing specially crafted classifiers (trained data used for object detection) using OpenCV. This data is typically loaded from an input file or data source.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious or specially crafted classifier to an application that uses OpenCV's Haar cascade object detection functionality. This could involve supplying a malicious input file or data stream.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability exists in OpenCV versions before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1.
- The provided code snippet from `cascadedetect.hpp` highlights the line where the vulnerability occurs: `sum += *cascadeLeaves[leafOfs - idx];`.
- The variable `idx` becomes negative due to an issue in the tree traversal logic before the vulnerable access.
- The SUSE Bugzilla entry [1144352](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1144352) confirms this vulnerability with reference to the upstream commit.

- The Fedora update notification indicates that a fix is available in opencv version 3.4.8-1.fc31.
- SUSE has released multiple advisories and patches addressing this vulnerability.
- OpenSUSE has also released a security update for the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been addressed by upstream in this commit : [321c74ccd6077bdea1d47450ca4fe955cb5b6330](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/commit/321c74ccd6077bdea1d47450ca4fe955cb5b6330).
