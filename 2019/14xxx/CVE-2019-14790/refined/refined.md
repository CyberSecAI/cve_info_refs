### Relevant Information:

*   **Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin's AJAX functionality uses the `grsGalleryAjax()` function, which loads `/ajax/GRSGalleryAjax.php` and calls `grsCheckAction()`. If the `grsAction` GET or POST input is set to "shortcode", the `display()` function in `/admin/views/ViewShortcode.php` is executed. The `task` GET input is assigned to the `$task` variable without sanitization and is then output without being escaped.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious `task` parameter.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Affected Component:** `/admin/views/ViewShortcode.php`
*   **Affected Input:** `$_GET['task']`
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability without authentication.
*   **Proof of Concept:**
