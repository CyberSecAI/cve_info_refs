```
## Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. During normal operation, HAProxy 2.0 (we have tried 2.0.0, 2.0.1 and 2.0.2) seem to suffer from a stuck thread, which causes a reload of HAProxy, which results in dropped connections.
2. The behaviour occurs numerous times a day (but at random intervals).
3. We changed the default balance method from roundrobin to random, without effect.
4. We changed the number of threads to 1 (from the default of 4), without effect. (In case of 4 threads, the stuck thread can be any of the 4).

## Actual behavior

HAProxy reloads, with the following logged to syslog:

```
haproxy[39744]: Thread 1 is about to kill the process.
haproxy[39744]: *>Thread 1 : act=1 glob=0 wq=1 rq=0 tl=1 tlsz=0 rqsz=0

```

On our fallback HAProxy instances (running 1.8.14 and earlier) we have not seen this behaviour.

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for haproxy
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2019:2555-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1142529
Cross-References: CVE-2019-14241
Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.0
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes one vulnerability is now available.
Description:
This update for haproxy to version 2.0.5+git0.d905f49a fixes the following
issues:
Security issue fixed:
- CVE-2019-14241: Fixed a cookie memory corruption problem. (bsc#1142529)
The update to 2.0.5 brings lots of features and bugfixes:
- new internal native HTTP representation called HTX, was already in 1.9
and is now enabled by default in 2.0
- end-to-end HTTP/2 support including trailers and continuation frames, as
needed for gRPC ; HTTP/2 may also be upgraded from HTTP/1.1 using the H2
preface;
- server connection pooling and more advanced reuse, with ALPN protocol
negotiation (already in 1.9)
- layer 7 retries, allowing to use 0-RTT and TCP Fast Open to the servers
as well as on the frontend
- much more scalable multi-threading, which is even enabled by default on
platforms where it was successfully tested ; by default, as many threads
are started as the number of CPUs haproxy is allowed to run on. This
removes a lot of configuration burden in VMs and containers
- automatic maxconn setting for the process and the frontends, directly
based on the number of available FDs (easier configuration in containers
and with systemd)
- logging to stdout for use in containers and systemd (already in 1.9).
Logs can now provide micro-second resolution for some events
- peers now support SSL, declaration of multiple stick-tables directly in
the peers section, and synchronization of server names, not just IDs
- In master-worker mode, the master process now exposes its own CLI and
can communicate with all other processes (including the stopping ones),
even allowing to connect to their CLI and check their state. It is also
possible to start some sidecar programs and monitor them from the
master, and the master can automatically kill old processes that
survived too many reloads
- the incoming connections are load-balanced between all threads depending
on their load to minimize the processing time and maximize the capacity
(already in 1.9)
- the SPOE connection load-balancing was significantly improved in order
to reduce high percentiles of SPOA response time (already in 1.9)
- the "random" load balancing algorithm and a power-of-two-choices variant
were introduced
- statistics improvements with per-thread counters for certain things, and
a prometheus exporter for all our statistics;
- lots of debugging help, it's easier to produce a core dump, there are
new commands on the CLI to control various things, there is a watchdog
to fail cleanly when a thread deadlock or a spinning task are detected,
so overall it should provide a better experience in field and less round
trips between users and developers (hence less stress during an
incident).
- all 3 device detection engines are now compatible with multi-threading
and can be build-tested without any external dependencies
- "do-resolve" http-request action to perform a DNS resolution on any,
sample, and resolvers now support relying on /etc/resolv.conf to match
the local resolver
- log sampling and balancing : it's now possible to send 1 log every 10 to
a server, or to spread the logging load over multiple log servers;
- a new SPOA agent (spoa\_server) allows to interface haproxy with Python
and Lua programs
- support for Solaris' event ports (equivalent of kqueue or epoll) which
will significantly improve the performance there when dealing with
numerous connections
- some warnings are now reported for some deprecated options that will be
removed in 2.1. Since 2.0 is long term supported, there's no emergency
to convert them, however if you see these warnings, you need to
understand that you're among their extremely rare users and just because
of this you may be taking risks by keeping them
- A new SOCKS4 server-side layer was provided ; it allows outgoing
connections to be forwarded through a SOCKS4 proxy (such as ssh -D).
- priority- and latency- aware server queues : it is possible now to
assign priorities to certain requests and/or to give them a time bonus
or penalty to refine control of the traffic and be able to engage on
SLAs.
- internally the architecture was significantly redesigned to allow to
further improve performance and make it easier to implement protocols
that span over multiple layers (such as QUIC). This work started in 1.9
and will continue with 2.1.
- the I/O, applets and tasks now share the same multi-threaded scheduler,
giving a much better responsiveness and fairness between all tasks as is
visible with the CLI which always responds instantly even under extreme
loads (started in 1.9)
- the internal buffers were redesigned to ease zero-copy operations, so
that it is possible to sustain a high bandwidth even when forwarding
HTTP/1 to/from HTTP/2 (already in 1.9)
This update was imported from the SUSE:SLE-15:Update update project.
Patch Instructions:
To install this openSUSE Security Update use the SUSE recommended installation methods
like YaST online\_update or "zypper patch".
Alternatively you can run the command listed for your product:
