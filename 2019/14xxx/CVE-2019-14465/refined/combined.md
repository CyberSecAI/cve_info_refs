## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Jul 30, 2019](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/issues/198#issue-474796327)

Hi,

While fuzzing Schism Tracker with Honggfuzz, I found a heap-based buffer overflow in the fmt\_mtm\_load\_song() function, in mtm.c L139.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it): [test01.mtm.gz](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/files/3448661/test01.mtm.gz)

Issue can be reproduced by running:

```
schismtracker test01.mtm

```

```
