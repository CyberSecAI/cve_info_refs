The provided content is related to CVE-2019-14261.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ABUS Secvest alarm system has an insufficient implementation of jamming detection. It does not detect short jamming signals that are shorter than normal ABUS RF messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unchecked Error Condition (CWE-391): The alarm system does not properly handle error conditions when receiving short jamming signals.
- Insufficient Jamming Detection: The system's jamming detection mechanism is inadequate and can be bypassed by short jamming signals.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can suppress legitimate RF messages sent between wireless components (e.g., detectors, remote controls) and the alarm central.
- This can prevent alarms from being triggered, even when an intrusion occurs.
- Attackers can disable the alarm system without authorization.

**Attack vectors:**
- Reactive jamming attack: An attacker uses a radio transmitter to detect the start of an RF message sent by a component of the alarm system and then overlays it with random data before the original RF message ends.
- This prevents the alarm central from properly decoding the original signal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be within RF range of the alarm system and its peripheral devices.
- They need the ability to transmit RF signals using a device capable of performing reactive jamming, such as a Teensy-based tool with a CC1101 sub-1GHz transceiver.
