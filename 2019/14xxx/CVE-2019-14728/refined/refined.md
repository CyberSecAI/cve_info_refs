Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14728:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper validation of the `forwaraddres` and `domainforwar` parameters when a user attempts to add a mail forwarder in the CentOS Web Panel (CWP).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application allows a user to specify arbitrary email addresses for forwarding without verifying that the target address belongs to the user. This allows manipulation of the parameters to forward emails to unauthorized accounts.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system fails to validate the `forwaraddres` and `domainforwar` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Email Forwarding:** An attacker can configure an email forwarder on a victim's account to redirect incoming emails to an attacker-controlled email address. This leads to:
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can intercept sensitive information sent to the victim's email address.
    *   **Phishing/Spam:** An attacker can use the victim's account to send phishing emails or spam, potentially harming the victim's reputation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out via the web interface of CentOS Web Panel's user panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the affected CentOS Web Panel.
*   **Network Interception:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests, typically through a web proxy (like Burp Suite or similar tools). This can be done by intercepting the request between the client and the server or by crafting the malicious request.
*   **Basic Understanding:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of web requests and parameter manipulation.

**More Detail than CVE:**

*   The provided content gives a specific step-by-step exploit scenario, including the vulnerable parameters (`forwaraddres`, `domainforwar`), and an example of the HTTP POST request that can be used to exploit the vulnerability. This level of detail is typically not found in the CVE description, which only outlines the high-level vulnerability.

**Note:**

*   The identified version of the CWP is `0.9.8.851`, which indicates the vulnerability was present at least in that version.

*   The provided information also notes that the "user panel only available for latest version", suggesting the vulnerability may be present across multiple, if not all, versions of the software that has the user panel included in the latest version

In Summary, this vulnerability allows an authenticated user to redirect email from a victim's account to an account of the attacker's choosing via manipulation of the mail forwarding parameters.
