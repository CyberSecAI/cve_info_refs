- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when processing markdown links, allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize the href attribute of a markdown link.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to full compromise of the user's session, including data theft and manipulation.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious markdown link with a javascript: URI scheme, which when rendered by the application, executes the embedded JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to input text into the editor in order to insert the malicious markdown. The application must parse the markdown and render the malicious link.
