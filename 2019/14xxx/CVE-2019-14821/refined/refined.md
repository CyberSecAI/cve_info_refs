Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor when handling Coalesced MMIO write operations. Specifically, the code operates on an MMIO ring buffer (`struct kvm_coalesced_mmio`) where write indices (`ring->first` and `ring->last`) are supplied by a host user-space process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Access:** The lack of proper validation of the `ring->first` and `ring->last` indices allows a host user-space process to supply invalid values, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access within the kernel.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The out-of-bounds access can crash the host kernel, leading to a DoS condition. This is the primary impact described.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability has the potential for privilege escalation, although this is less clearly defined. Accessing memory out of the allocated range can cause data corruption or be used to overwrite certain memory locations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability is triggered by a host user/process with access to the `/dev/kvm` device. This indicates that the attacker must have local access to the host system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local, authenticated user with the ability to interact with the `/dev/kvm` device. This typically requires some level of privilege on the host system.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the specific way the Coalesced MMIO write operations are implemented and the lack of bounds checking.
*   **Ability to Monitor Execution Time**: According to one of the comments in the RedHat bugzilla report a local authenticated attacker with the ability to monitor execution time is able to infer TSX memory state by comparing abort execution times.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the Linux kernel and affects versions up to 5.3.
*   The vulnerability is present in the implementation of Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) abortion.
*   It is described as being quite similar to the Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) issue.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via a side-channel attack, by comparing abort execution times.
