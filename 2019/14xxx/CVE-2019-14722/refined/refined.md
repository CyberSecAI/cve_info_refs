Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14722:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the email forwarder deletion functionality within the CentOS Web Panel (CWP). Specifically, the system does not verify if a user is authorized to delete a specific forwarder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The vulnerability is a type of IDOR, where a user can manipulate the `email` parameter in the request to delete a mail forwarder that belongs to a different user.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The system fails to implement proper checks to ensure that the user initiating the deletion request is the actual owner of the forwarder being targeted.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can delete email forwarders of other users within the same CWP instance. This could lead to:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By deleting legitimate email forwarders, the attacker can disrupt email delivery for affected users.
    *   **Loss of Functionality:** Users will lose the ability to forward email to desired addresses, which could interrupt workflows and communications.
    *   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Disruption of email could be a step in a more complex attack, such as intercepting password resets or other sensitive communications.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the web interface of the CentOS Web Panel. Specifically, the user email accounts management page.
*   The attacker needs to be a valid user of the CWP.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the CWP system.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests made from their browser, typically done by using a web proxy.
*   The attacker must know or guess a target email address that is being used in an email forwarder on the server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The exploit involves intercepting the HTTP POST request made when a user attempts to delete an email forwarder.
*   The vulnerable parameter is "email" within the POST body.
*   By modifying the value of the `email` parameter to that of another user's forwarder, the attacker can delete that target forwarder.
*   The request does include a CSRF token, but this does not prevent exploitation as the attacker is an authenticated user.
*   The vulnerability is in the `email_accounts` module of CWP, specifically the action `forwardelete`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided exploit information is specific to CWP version 0.9.8.851 but is likely to be present in earlier versions as well.
*   The exploit was tested on CentOS 7.6.1810 and Firefox 68.0.1 (64-bit) but is likely to be applicable to other systems with the same CWP version.
