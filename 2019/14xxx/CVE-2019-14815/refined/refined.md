  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The `mwifiex_set_wmm_params()` function in the Marvell WiFi driver calls memcpy to copy WLAN_OUI_MICROSOFT element to bss_cfg->wmm_info without checking the length of the source data.  Since the source data comes from user space, a heap buffer overflow can occur.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability due to missing length check before memcpy operation in the `mwifiex_set_wmm_params()` function."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted packets sent via netlink.",
      "Local user with the ability to configure a device handled by the vulnerable driver."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to configure a device using the Marvell WiFi driver.",
      "Local user privileges"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The destination buffer `bss_cfg->wmm_info` is of type `struct mwifiex_types_wmm_info` which has a fixed size of 24 bytes. The vulnerability exists because the length of the data being copied into the buffer is not checked against the size of the buffer before the memcpy, allowing a malicious user to overflow the buffer and corrupt memory. The attacker has to be local and have necessary permissions to configure the device."
