- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Multiple arbitrary command injections. The specific mechanism of injection (e.g., vulnerable function or input) is not specified in the provided content.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary command injection vulnerabilities are present in the Verifone MX900, specifically in the file manager and potentially other areas.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the affected device, which could result in a compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The CVSS score indicates limited impact on each.
- **Attack vectors**: The access vector is "Local", which means an attacker would need local access to the device to exploit it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) and no user interaction (UI:N). They must be able to run code within the security context of the vulnerable device. The report also suggests the attack can achieve a changed security scope (S:C) meaning that impact is not confined to the device itself.
