Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability in the Custom 404 Pro plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the plugin was using `$_GET['s']` and `$_REQUEST['page']` directly in the admin panel's logs view without proper escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin was vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of sanitization of `$_GET['s']` and `$_REQUEST['page']` parameters in the `/admin/views/logs.php` file. Although a fix was attempted by escaping `$_GET['s']` using `esc_html()`, the `$_REQUEST['page']` parameter was left unescaped, leaving the vulnerability open.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `page` parameter, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the administrator's session. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
- In the provided Proof of Concept (PoC), the injected script simply triggers an alert box showing cookies when an admin is logged in. However, it could be replaced with more malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET/POST requests to the WordPress admin panel, specifically when viewing the plugin's logs page.
- An attacker would need to trick an administrator into submitting a form containing the malicious payload or visiting a specially crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft an HTTP request with the malicious payload within the `page` parameter.
- The attacker needs to trick an administrator into clicking on the crafted link/form while the administrator is logged in to the WordPress admin panel.
- The plugin's admin page where the vulnerability exists (`c4p-main`) is only accessible to users with the `manage_options` capability, typically administrators.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content mentions that other vulnerability data sources incorrectly reported the vulnerability as fixed. The attempted fix only addressed the `$_GET['s']` parameter and not `$_REQUEST['page']`.
- The vulnerability exists in the `/admin/views/logs.php` file of the plugin.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when an administrator accesses the Custom 404 Pro plugin's admin page (`c4p-main`).
- The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting JavaScript that displays the user's cookies in an alert box when the administrator is logged in, illustrating the potential for session hijacking.
- The author of the article has full disclosed the vulnerability due to the WordPress support forum's moderators behavior.
