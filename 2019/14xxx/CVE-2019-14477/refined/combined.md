################################################################################
Introduction:
-------------
NetCrunch [1] is a so-called "agentless" monitoring solution developed by
AdRem. It allows system administrators to monitor, visualize and get alerts
from many kinds of systems in their network. The solution consists of a server
and a fat client (also called console), as well as a web client.
Due to its architecture, the monitoring server is a critical system as it
holds credentials, most of the time privileged, for all monitored system.
Compass Security identified an Improper Credential Storage since the internal
user database is readable by low-privileged users and passwords in the
database are weakly encoded or encrypted.
Affected:
---------
Initially vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 10.6.0.4587
Not vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 11.0.0.5282 (permissions on file fixed)
Still vulnerable:
\* AdRem NetCrunch 11.0.0.5282 (passwords still weakly encoded)
No other version was tested, but it is believed that older versions are also
vulnerable.
Technical Description:
----------------------
NetCrunch's internal user database is stored in UserProfiles.xml. However,
every user of the system has read-access to it:
C:\>icacls C:\ProgramData\AdRem\NetCrunch\data\UserProfiles.xml
C:\ProgramData\AdRem\NetCrunch\data\UserProfiles.xml NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
To prove this, we created a low-privileged user called "compass":
C:\>net user /add compass \*
Type a password for the user:
Retype the password to confirm:
The command completed successfully.
Then we used this user to retrieve the content of the database:
C:\>runas /profile /user:compass /savecred "cmd /k type C:\ProgramData\AdRem\NetCrunch\data\UserProfiles.xml"
Attempting to start cmd /k type C:\ProgramData\AdRem\NetCrunch\data\UserProfiles.xml as user "SOME-SERVER\compass" ...
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?

After investigating the "Passwd" attribute with different passwords, it is
obvious that the passwords are not hashes but encoded or encrypted:
password -> 6mcuPTptWK1M+
password0 -> 7mcuPTptWK1Nm
password1 -> 7mcuPTptWK1Nn
password2 -> 7mcuPTptWK1Nk
password3 -> 7mcuPTptWK1Nl
password4 -> 7mcuPTptWK1Nq
password5 -> 7mcuPTptWK1Nr
password10 -> 8mcuPTptWK1NnZk++
password11 -> 8mcuPTptWK1NnZU++
password12 -> 8mcuPTptWK1NnZE++
password13 -> 8mcuPTptWK1NnZ+++
password14 -> 8mcuPTptWK1NnYk++
000000 -> 4H4Mz55Z6
100000 -> 4HKMz55Z6
200000 -> 4HaMz55Z6
0000000 -> 5H4Mz55Z68k++
00000000 -> 6pprBUg3IQNY+
000000000 -> 7pprBUg3IQNaI
It is therefore possible to decode or decrypt the "Passwd" attribute in order
to find the original password with the NetCrunch application acting as a
decryption oracle.
Workaround / Fix:
-----------------
Fix the permissions in order to prevent low-privileged users on the system
from reading the user database.
Additionally, use an adequate algorithm for hashing passwords, such as PBKDF2,
bcrypt or scrypt. Password hashes should always be stored with a strong salt
that is unique per user.
As a NetCrunch customer, update your installation to the latest version to
receive the fix.
Timeline:
---------
2019-05-23: Discovery by Fabio Poloni, Thierry Viaccoz and Sylvain Heiniger
2019-08-01: Assigned CVE-2019-14477
2019-08-29: Initial vendor notification
