After analyzing the provided content, here's a breakdown of the relevant information regarding CVE-2019-14937.

Based on the provided content:

**1.  Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content directly relates to a vulnerability in REDCap, specifically a SQL injection vulnerability.
*   The versions of REDCap mentioned as being vulnerable in the content (8.11.5 to before 9.3.0) align with the time frame when CVE-2019-14937 was publicly disclosed.

**2.  Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a time-based SQL injection vulnerability present in the calendar function, specifically through the `cal_id` parameter in the `calendar_popup_ajax.php` file.
*   The input passed via the `cal_id` parameter is not sanitized or validated correctly, which allows malicious SQL code to be executed on the server.

**3.  Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   SQL Injection: Specifically, time-based SQL injection.
*   Lack of input validation and sanitization of the `cal_id` parameter.

**4.  Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The attacker can extract any data from the REDCap database via time-based SQL injection.
*   Impact escalation of privileges: TRUE (the exploit can grant the attacker access to data, and potentially functionality, that they should not be able to access).

**5.  Attack Vectors:**

*   Remote: The vulnerability is accessible remotely.
*   User must be logged in to the REDCap application.
*   User must have access to a specific project in the REDCap application to exploit the vulnerability in the calendar functionality.
*   The attacker must perform an edit notes action and pass the malicious `cal_id` parameter to `calendar_popup_ajax.php`.

**6.  Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   A valid account in the REDCap application.
*   User must have update permissions for events in the calendar for a specific project.
*   Ability to craft a malicious URL that contains a SQL injection payload, specifically for the `cal_id` parameter.

**Additional Information:**

*   The content from `gist.github.com` provides explicit steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including the vulnerable URL endpoint.
*   The content also references the fix in the REDCap changelog provided by `www.evms.edu`.
*   The information provided is more detailed than the official CVE description by including exact steps to reproduce and a specific vulnerable parameter (`cal_id`).
*   The github content also includes a screenshot of the vulnerability.
*   The content notes that the vulnerability was fixed in version 9.3.0.

**Summary**

The provided documents relate to a time-based SQL injection vulnerability in REDCap affecting versions from 8.11.5 to before 9.3.0. The vulnerability is triggered via the `cal_id` parameter in `calendar_popup_ajax.php`, allowing authenticated users with sufficient privileges to extract data from the database. The attacker must be able to craft specific URLs that include a time-based SQL injection payload, which is used in the vulnerable parameter.
