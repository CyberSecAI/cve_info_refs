### CVE-2019-14725
The provided content relates to CVE-2019-14725. Specifically, it details a vulnerability in CWP (CentOS Control Web Panel) version 0.9.8.851 that allows a normal user to change the target email for mail usage quota updates.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from the ability of a user to modify the "email" parameter in the `updquotaemail` function when updating email account quotas. The server doesn't properly validate or restrict the target email address, allowing users to potentially modify quotas for other email accounts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Lack of input validation:** The application fails to properly validate the "email" parameter, allowing a user to specify an arbitrary email address.
*   **Authorization issue:** Normal users should not be able to modify settings for other user's email accounts.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can modify the quota of arbitrary email accounts on the system. This could lead to denial of service by setting a low quota or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack is performed through the user panel by intercepting the request to update an email quota and modifying the `email` parameter to a target email address.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be a logged-in, normal user in the CWP.
*   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a web proxy).
