Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-14681

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing nonce check in the `Deny All Firewall` plugin's settings page. Specifically, the plugin allows disabling its functionality through a GET request with the `daf_remove=true` parameter without verifying the request's origin or legitimacy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary weakness is the absence of CSRF protection when disabling the plugin. This allows an attacker to trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly sending a malicious request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in the plugin's firewall functionality being disabled. This action exposes the WordPress site to various security risks that the plugin was intended to mitigate.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Link:** An attacker can craft a malicious link (or embed it in an image, etc) and trick a logged-in administrator into clicking on it. This link would contain the `daf_remove=true` GET parameter, causing the plugin's rules to be removed.
- **Social Engineering:** Attackers could use various social engineering techniques to make the victim click the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL that includes the vulnerable parameter.
- **Target a Logged-in Administrator:** The attacker must target a logged-in administrator of the WordPress site that is using the plugin. The exploit relies on the administrator's existing session and permissions to execute the request.
- No special server access or network positioning is required, the attacker needs to be able to convince the admin to load the malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The plugin's settings page is accessible to users with the `manage_options` capability, typically administrators.
- The vulnerability is located in the `daf_settings_page()` function within the `/deny-all-firewall.php` file.
- The vulnerable code block is:
```php
if (isset($_GET['daf_remove']) && $_GET['daf_remove'] == 'true') {
    if ($this->daf_remove_rules()) {
```
