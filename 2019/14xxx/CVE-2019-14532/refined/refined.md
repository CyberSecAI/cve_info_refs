  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-14532",
    "description": "The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is vulnerable to an off-by-one overwrite due to an underflow in tools/hashtools/hfind.cpp when using a specially crafted hash table file. When processing the first line of a hash table file, if the first character is a NULL byte, the program attempts to remove a newline character via strlen(buf)-1. However, strlen will return 0, which leads to writing a null byte at buf[-1], causing an out-of-bounds write.",
    "root_cause": "An off-by-one error occurs due to an underflow when handling a malformed hash table file in `tools/hashtools/hfind.cpp`. Specifically, if the first character read from the file is a NULL byte, the program calculates an incorrect index for null-termination, resulting in a write to a memory location before the allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Off-by-one error",
      "Integer underflow",
      "Out-of-bounds write",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially overwrite memory locations leading to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "An attacker provides a specially crafted hash table file with a NULL byte as the first character, which is then processed by the `hfind` tool.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed hash file as input to the vulnerable application, `hfind`."
