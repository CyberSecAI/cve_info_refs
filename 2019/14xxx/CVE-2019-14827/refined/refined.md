Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14827:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of Mustache helper tags within template contexts. Specifically, these tags were not being escaped before the context was injected into another Mustache helper. This lack of escaping allowed for the possibility of script injection through recursive rendering of mustache templates.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Improper output escaping:** The core issue was that Mustache helper tags included in template contexts were not properly sanitized (escaped) before being used in a new context within a Mustache template. This allowed for the inclusion of raw HTML, including potentially malicious JavaScript.
- **Recursive template rendering:** The vulnerability relied on the recursive rendering process where the context is re-evaluated and included inside another template via a Mustache helper, which exacerbated the lack of escaping.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **JavaScript injection:** An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the rendered page.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected JavaScript could be used to perform a variety of malicious actions, including:
  - Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
  - Defacing websites.
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Displaying malicious content.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious template context:** An attacker would need to control or inject the contents of a template context to include malicious JavaScript within a Mustache helper. This would be triggered when the template is rendered.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Control of template context:** The attacker needs to control the data that is passed to the mustache template engine. This usually requires a privileged position or the ability to inject data that will be used in a template.
- **Understanding of vulnerable templates:** The attacker would need to know which templates and contexts are vulnerable to exploitation.
