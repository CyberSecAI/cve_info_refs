Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-14823:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Java Security Services (JSS) "Leaf and Chain" OCSP policy implementation implicitly trusts the root certificate in a certificate chain, without attempting to validate it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper certificate chain validation within the JSS CryptoManager when using the "Leaf and Chain" OCSP policy.
- The vulnerability stems from the assumption that the root certificate is trusted without proper validation, and affects applications using this policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Applications using the vulnerable JSS policy may accept a specially crafted certificate, leading to potential Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.
- Successful exploitation could compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability of resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Man-in-the-Middle attack: An attacker could intercept and modify network traffic, presenting a malicious certificate to vulnerable applications.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the client and the server.
- The attacker needs to be able to generate a malicious certificate chain that the JSS library will accept due to the lack of root certificate validation.

**Affected versions (as mentioned in the bugzilla):**
- 4.4.x: 4.4.6+
- 4.5.x: versions after 4.5.3
- 4.6.x: 4.6.0+
- Red Hat Certificate System 9.4 and above.

**Additional details:**
- Red Hat Enterprise Satellite 6 does not ship a vulnerable version of the JSS library.
- Fixes for the vulnerability were released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (RHSA-2019:3067) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 Extended Update Support (RHSA-2019:3225).
- Fedora updates were also released to address this issue (FEDORA-2019-4d33c62860 for Fedora 29, FEDORA-2019-68c2fbcf82 for Fedora 30, and FEDORA-2019-24a0a2f24e for Fedora 31).
- The vulnerability is described as having a high severity and an important security impact.
