## Installation

Install Popup Builder either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server.

Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

Go to the Popup Builder settings and set your desired options.

## FAQ

### How many popups can I create?

You can create as many popups as you want, there is no limit either on the Free or the PRO version.

### Can I have more than one popup on the same page?

You can have as many popups as you want on the same page, but you can only set one popup to be opened on page load, the others must be set to open on click.

### How can I set a popup to open automatically?

After creating your popup, go to the desired page or post and you will see a meta box below the content editor, with the following title: “Select popup on page load”. Select the popup you want to set and then update the page. You are done! After you go to that page/post the popup will get opened automatically.

### Want to insert a popup on a link, that will open up when clicked on the link?

Simply add the following class to it: sg-confirm-popup-#popupid.

Ex. `<a href="https://popup-builder.com/" class="sg-confirm-popup-1">Popup</a>`

This will open a popup before a user goes to the page from the link.

### How to redirect users after clicking on the popup image?

Go to the `Options` section of your popup and find “Dismiss on content click” option.

Then Select “Redirect” option and in the URL field type the URL of the page you need your users to be redirected to.

### Can I show a popup after a specific amount of time?

Under the Effects panel you will see ‘Popup opening delay’ option, all you need to do is to enter the amount of time (seconds) after which popup will be shown.

### Want to open your links inside the popup without redirecting your users to the other site? (PRO)

You can simply create an empty iframe popup and add the following class to your link: sg-iframe-popup-#popupid number.

Ex. `<a href="https://popup-builder.com/" class="sg-iframe-popup-1">Popup</a>`

This way, you’ll have an iframe popup on your link, so when a user clicks on your link an iframe popup will open up, with the page of the link inside, so the users won’t be redirected by the link.

### Can I put a popup to show after clicking something?

Yes. There is an “Insert popup” button which will insert the popup shortcode over any element (text, image, button, etc.) you want. Just select the element, click on the button, choose a popup and you are done!

Ex. [sg\_popup id=”1″ event=”click”]Your text, or HTML element[/sg\_popup]

Ex. [sg\_popup id=”1″ event=”click” wrap=”span”]Your text, which will be wraped inside span element[/sg\_popup]

Ex. [sg\_popup id=”1″ event=”click”]`<img src="https://sygnoos.com/images/sygnoos_logo_grey.png">`[/sg\_popup]

Alternative method in case if shortcode doesn’t satisfy your needs

Adding the following class `sg-popup-id-1`

Example: `<span class='sg-popup-id-1'>Popup #1</span>`

### Can I change the wrapping element of onclick popup?

Yes, you can change it. You can write any HTML element you need to wrap your content in the wrapper attribute of your onclick popup.

Example: `[sg_popup id="1" event="click" wrap="span"]Your text, which will be wraped inside span element[/sg_popup]`

### Can I put a popup to show after hovering an element?

Sure, you can! Just insert your text into the following code: `[sg_popup id="1" event="hover" wrap="span"]Your text, which will be wrapped inside span element[/sg_popup]`

### Can I change the wrapping element of hovering popup?

Yes, you can change it. You can write any HTML element you need to wrap your content in the wrapper attribute of your hovering popup.

Example: `[sg_popup id="1" event="hover" wrap="span"]Your text, which will be wraped inside span element[/sg_popup]`

### How to create a shortcode popup?

It’s a very easy thing to do, just follow the steps!

* Find “Popup Builder” plugin on the left bar
* Press “Add new Popup” button
* Press “Shortcode” button
* Enter a title for the Popup
* Setup general options of the popup
* Enter a Shortcode
* Setup effects of the popup
* Setup the dimensions of the popup
* Setup advanced options of the popup
* After creating press “Save changes” right above the page
* Find the popup you created in “All popups” on the left bar

One perfect news for the popup builder users! Our popup builder plugin is now compatible with any other plugins’ shortcodes!

### How to make the Popup responsive?

To make your popup responsive you should do the following:

Set width and height in percent(%) and then set Max width and Max height in pixels (px).

When the screen is too wide, Max width option will work and it will prevent showing popup large.

Example of responsive popup:

Width: 80%

Height: 90%

Max width: 640px

Max height: 480px

### What URL do I have to enter in the URL field of the facebook popup?

You should enter the URL of the site you want to share.

### How to redirect user to specific page when he/she clicks on popup?

You should create any type of popup.

* From the Popup’s options, find “Dismiss on content click” option.
* Check it.
* Select “Redirect” button.
* In the “URL” field enter the URL of the page you need your users to be redirected to.

Don’t forget to Save changes!)

### Can I make the video play automatically in the Video popup? (PRO)

Sure! If you want your video to play automatically, we have an option specially for that case. Just select “Autoplay” and your video will play automatically. Please be noted that autoplay option will not work on mobile devices as there are browser restrictions.

### What do I have to write in the field “Label” of the Age Restriction popup? (PRO)

You can write the text which you want to see on the button. (“Yes” or “No”)

### What if I don’t have any specific URL to be shared in my social popup?

You can select “Use active URL” and the current page URL will be shared.

### Why should I buy the PRO package?

The Free version of Popup Builder gives you anything you need for creating unlimited fully functional popups and insert them wherever you want. Our PRO package gives you the ability to create more specific popups, like iframe, video or shortcode popups. Also, advanced options will be available for you to disable popup closing, disable popup for mobile devices, show the popup only once, and many other features. So if you need these advanced popups and functionalities, get Popup Builder PRO [here](http://popup-builder.com).

### How to upgrade to PRO version without losing popup’s data?

We made it very easy for you! All you need to do is:

* In your Menu sidebar, go to Popup -> “Settings” section.
* Disable the “Delete popup data” option.

That’s all! And you don’t need to delete your Free version manually before upgrading to Pro!

### How can I add a sound on popup opening?

From the ‘Effects’ panel enable ‘Popup open sound’ option and choose the sound you would like to be played on the popup opening.

Please be noted that browser’s don’t support all the formats. We recommend to use the WAV format.

### Can I create a popup and make it invisible for some countries? (PRO)

Our plugin has an option for such cases. You can select “Filter popup for selected countries” option, which allows you to select the countries in which you want the popup to be shown or hidden, because there can be some popups which you make for specific countries and you may not want them to be seen in some other countries in cases of targeting groups for your marketing. (Allow/Disallow)

### What’s Live Preview in Countdown, Subscription and Contact Form popups for? (PRO)

Live preview is a great option which gives you an opportunity to see all the changes you make while creating your popup without saving it after every single change.

### Something is not working. What do I do?

Contact us! Depending on your server configuration something may go wrong, please don’t hesitate on contacting us, we are here to help you! Our support email is: support@popup-builder.com
