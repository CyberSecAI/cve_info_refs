Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Business Central handles HTTP requests during the login process. The HTTP request discloses sensitive information such as username and password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** User credentials (username and password) are being transmitted in the HTTP request without proper encryption or obfuscation. This makes them vulnerable to interception.
- **Lack of HTTPS:** The description indicates the issue is exposed when intercepted with tools like Burp Suite, suggesting the application might not be enforcing HTTPS for login, or improperly handles the credentials before encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker can intercept the HTTP request containing the username and password, gaining unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Once the credentials are stolen, the attacker could log in to the Business Central console and perform actions as the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can position themselves between the user and the server, intercepting the HTTP request during login.
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same network as the user can passively sniff network traffic and capture the login request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the Business Central server.
- This could involve being on the same network as the user or being in a position to perform a MitM attack.

**Summary of Technical Details:**
The bug report specifically mentions that HTTP requests during login for Business Central console expose sensitive data when intercepted via tools like Burp Suite. This indicates a lack of encryption for user credentials during transmission.
