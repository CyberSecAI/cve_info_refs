    "CVE": "CVE-2019-14492",
    "description": "An issue was discovered in OpenCV before 3.4.7 and 4.x before 4.1.1. There is an out of bounds read/write in the function HaarEvaluator::OptFeature::calc in modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp, which leads to denial of service.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "OpenCV before 3.4.7",
      "OpenCV 4.x before 4.1.1"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Out of bounds read/write in the function HaarEvaluator::OptFeature::calc within modules/objdetect/src/cascadedetect.hpp.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read",
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service",
        "attack_vector": "The attack vector can be both local and network based, depending on the application using OpenCV. User interaction might be required in some cases (e.g., opening a malicious file with OpenCV).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path with a crafted input. This could be through a malicious file, network data, or other means. No special privileges are needed."
