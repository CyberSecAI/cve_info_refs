Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing permissions check in the `/rest/api/1.0/render` resource within Atlassian Jira. This allows anonymous users to interact with the API in a way that discloses sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is information disclosure. The API endpoint reveals the validity of both issue keys and attachment names.

*   **Missing Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks on the `/rest/api/1.0/render` endpoint, allowing unauthenticated users to make requests that expose sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Issue Key Enumeration:** Attackers can identify valid issue keys, which might be used for further targeted attacks or information gathering.
*   **Attachment Name Enumeration:** Attackers can enumerate valid attachment names, which could expose the nature of attached documents and potentially lead to further exploitation if the content is sensitive and access to the attachment is not properly secured.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/rest/api/1.0/render` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Anonymous Access:** The attacker does not need any authentication or a valid session on the Jira instance. They can be a remote, unauthenticated user.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the vulnerable Jira instance.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker sends a POST request to `/rest/api/1.0/render` with a JSON body specifying the `rendererType` as `atlassian-wiki-renderer`.
*   To check for issue key validity the `unrenderedMarkup` contains any non-valid attachment name and the `issueKey` contains the key to test
*   To check for attachment name validity the `unrenderedMarkup` contains the attachment name to test and the `issueKey` contains a valid issue key.
*   The response to the request indicates if the provided issue key or attachment name is valid based on the content of the response.
*   A response containing “No usable issue stored in the context…” indicates the issue-key is not valid.
*   A response containing “Unable to render embedded object…” indicates the issue-key is valid.
*  A response containing “Unable to render embedded object…” indicates the filename is not valid for the issue.
*  A response containing “Unable to embed resource…” or a link to the file like “…/secure/attachment/…” indicates the filename is valid.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Atlassian Jira versions from 7.6.4 to 8.1.0 are affected.

**Patched Versions:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Jira versions 8.4.0 and 7.13.13.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Ben Taylor of Cisco ASIG.
*   The issue is classified as having a CVSSv3 score of 5.3 (Medium).
*   The vulnerability is identified as CWE-862 (Missing Authorization).
