Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-14817:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the improper securing of privileged calls within the `.pdfexectoken` and other procedures in Ghostscript. Specifically, the vulnerability is due to the exposure of the `.forceput` operator within these procedures, allowing scripts to bypass the `-dSAFER` restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper restriction of privileged calls.
- Exposure of `.forceput` operator within `.pdfexectoken` and other procedures, leading to a safer mode bypass.
- The `-dSAFER` restriction designed to limit file system access and code execution can be disabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Bypassing of `-dSAFER` restrictions, allowing file system access outside of restricted areas.
- Potential execution of arbitrary commands with the privileges of the process.
- Disabling security protections.
- Denial-of-Service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By processing a specially crafted PostScript file via Ghostscript.
- Input vector is by processing a malicious PDF file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted PostScript file.
- The attacker needs to entice a user to process this file with a vulnerable version of GPL Ghostscript.
- No authentication is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Ghostscript versions prior to 9.50, including those up to 9.27.
- The upstream fix involves disabling and restricting the accessibility of the `.forceput` operator and securing the privileged calls within affected procedures.
- Mitigation included in post gs-9.27 prevents arbitrary file access & code execution.
- The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution if the script disables `-dSAFER`.
- This vulnerability is related to other similar vulnerabilities where privileged operators were not properly secured.
- Affected products include Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 & 8, Fedora, SUSE Linux, and Debian.
