Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Ansible Tower 3.6.0 handles Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) credentials after a license is applied.
- Specifically, the RHSM username and password are saved in plaintext in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Plaintext Storage:**  RHSM credentials (username and password) are stored unencrypted in the database.
- **Exposure via API:** The plaintext credentials become accessible through the `/api/v2/config/` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers who gain access to the exposed credentials can log in to RHSM.
- **License Modification:** Attackers can modify licenses associated with the affected system.
- **Other Changes:** Attackers may be able to make other unauthorized changes to the RHSM environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Access:** The primary attack vector is through accessing the `/api/v2/config/` endpoint of Ansible Tower.
- **Database Compromise:**  If an attacker gains access to the underlying database, they can directly retrieve the plaintext credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Ansible Tower instance to interact with the API.
- **API Access/Authentication:** The attacker needs to be able to authenticate with the Ansible Tower API to retrieve the configuration.
- **Potential Database Access:**  If the attacker has access to the database, they can bypass API access and still retrieve the exposed information.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Ansible Tower version 3.6.0.
- Versions 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 are not vulnerable.
- CloudForms 5.9 and 5.10 are not vulnerable.
- There is no mitigation for this issue other than applying the fix.
- The issue is resolved in Ansible Tower version 3.6.1.
