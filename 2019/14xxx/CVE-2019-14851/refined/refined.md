Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14851:

*   **Root Cause:** The fix for a previous flaw in nbdkit introduced a new vulnerability. A client issuing `NBD_OPT_INFO` before `NBD_OPT_GO` would trigger back-to-back calls to the `open()` callback. The first `open()` call would not have a corresponding `close()` call, leading to an assertion failure.
*   **Vulnerability:** Assertion failure due to incorrect sequence of commands from the client, resulting in mismatched `open()` and `close()` calls.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). A crafted client could cause nbdkit to exit.
*   **Attack Vector:** A malicious or crafted NBD client.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the nbdkit service. The impact is limited if nbdkit is not exposed over TCP or is bound to a private network, or is protected by firewall rules. If nbdkit is configured with TLS client authentication, only trusted clients can carry out this attack.
*   **Affected Versions:** nbdkit versions 1.12.7, 1.14.1, and 1.15.1.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed in nbdkit versions 1.12.8, 1.14.2, and 1.15.2.
