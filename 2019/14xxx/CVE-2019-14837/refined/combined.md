| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-07-16 09:01:30 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in keycloack before version 8.0.0. The owner of 'placeholder.org' domain can setup mail server on this domain and knowing only name of a client can reset password and then log in. For example, for client name 'test' the email address will be 'service-account-test'  Upstream issue:  <https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-10780>  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/commit/9a7c1a91a59ab85e7f8889a505be04a71580777f>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c1)  Jason Shepherd    2019-08-12 02:21:37 UTC  ``` The version of Keycloak used in Red Hat Mobile Application Platform did not have the Service Account feature. It was added in version 1.4, see: <https://planet.jboss.org/post/service_accounts_support_in_keycloak>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c5)  Paramvir jindal    2019-09-13 11:59:46 UTC  ``` please refer to these screen shot attach to replicate this.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c6)  Paramvir jindal    2019-09-13 12:00:18 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1614803](attachment.cgi?id=1614803 "Series of screenshots") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1614803&action=edit "Series of screenshots") Series of screenshots   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c7)  Paramvir jindal    2019-09-13 12:16:27 UTC  ``` Steps to reproduce :  - Create an application and deploy it on JBoss EAP with authentication mechanism as BASIC and secure it with RHSSO. - Register this application this as a RHSSO client (confidential client) with service account enabled (shown in the screen shot attached). - Setup email server and email verification in RHSSO Realm. (shown in the screen shot attached). - I have also attached screen shot of my local JDBC client showing the USER_ENTITY table from H2 database. Observe the default email ID created of service accounts.(shown in the screen shot attached) - Just to be sure that RHSSO indeed send password reset emails, change the default email ID with the one you have access to. - Now access your application URL and click on "forget password". - Enter the user name as "service-account-<client-id>" and click submit. (shown in the screen shot attached) - You will get the password reset email on your email ID.(shown in the screen shot attached) - Now reset the password and login again with the new password.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c10)  Marian Rehak    2019-10-23 13:58:10 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Vadim Ashikhman   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c11)  Paramvir jindal    2019-11-12 06:06:02 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  It is not a very straight forward workaround but it is possible to mitigate this by manually editing the default Email ID (service_account_name) to some valid email ID (abc) in the USER_ENTITY table in the RHSSO database used.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c14)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-12-02 17:02:52 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:4041 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4041](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A4041)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-12-02 17:03:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 for RHEL 6  Via RHSA-2019:4040 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4040](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A4040)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-12-02 17:03:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On 7.3 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:4042 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4042](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A4042)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c17)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-12-02 17:21:16 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Single Sign-On  Via RHSA-2019:4045 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4045](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A4045)   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1730227#c18)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-12-02 19:04:55 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
