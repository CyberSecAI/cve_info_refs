Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-14765, as well as the other CVEs mentioned in the text:

**CVE-2019-14765**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect Access Control. Specifically, the `AfficheExplorateurParam()` function in DIMO YellowBox CRM before 6.3.4 does not properly restrict access, allowing standard authenticated users to use administrative controllers.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Incorrect Access Control:** Standard users can invoke administrative functions through the javascript API.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially gain access to administrative functionalities and sensitive information that they should not have access to.
*   **Attack Vectors:** A standard authenticated user invokes administrative functions by calling the javascript API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have standard user access.

The provided content also details other vulnerabilities in DIMO YellowBox CRM before version 6.3.4:

*   **Directory Traversal in File Browser (likely related to CVE-2019-14766):**
    *   **Root Cause**: Path traversal vulnerability in the file browser
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: Allows a standard authenticated user to browse the server file system.
    *   **Impact**: Information Disclosure - An attacker can access files they should not have access to.
    *   **Attack Vectors**: Attacker calls a vulnerable URL.
    *   **Required Capabilities**: The attacker needs a valid user account.

*   **Directory Traversal via `images/Apparence` and `servletrecuperefichier` (likely related to CVE-2019-14767):**
    *   **Root Cause**: Path traversal vulnerabilities in `images/Apparence` and `servletrecuperefichier`
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**:  Allows an unauthenticated user to download arbitrary files from the server.
    *   **Impact**: Information Disclosure. An attacker could download sensitive files from the server.
    *   **Attack Vectors**: Attacker calls a vulnerable URL.
    *  **Required Capabilities**: No authentication required.

*   **Arbitrary File Upload via File Browser (likely related to CVE-2019-14768):**
    *   **Root Cause**: Arbitrary File Upload vulnerability in the file browser combined with Path Traversal.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities**: A standard user can upload a malicious WAR file, using a path traversal vulnerability, allowing remote code execution.
    *   **Impact**: Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges.
    *   **Attack Vectors**: Uploading a malicious WAR application to the Tomcat webroot through path traversal.
    *   **Required Capabilities**:  The attacker needs a valid user account.
