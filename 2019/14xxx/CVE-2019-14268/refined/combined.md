## Description

![@matt-richardson](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/373389?v=4&size=48)[matt-richardson](https://github.com/matt-richardson)opened [on Jul 25, 2019](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/5739#issue-472623907)

Relates to: OctopusDeploy/OctopusDeploy#4112.

# Prerequisites

* We are ready to publicly disclose this vulnerability or exploit according to our [responsible disclosure process](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/2430143/Security%2BDisclosure%2BPolicy).
* I have raised a CVE according to our [CVE process](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/8290305/Requesting%2Ba%2BCVE%2BID)
* I have written a descriptive issue title
* I have linked the original source of this report
* I have tagged the issue appropriately (area/security, kind/bug, tag/regression?)

## Description

In certain limited circumstances, the password for a proxy configured via the Octopus Server Manager may be logged in cleartext to the deployment log.

CVE: [CVE-2019-14268](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w85c-jhm2-j3fm "CVE-2019-14268")

## Affected versions

**Octopus Server:** 3.0.19 to 2019.7.3

## Mitigation

Only customers using a proxy which requires authentication are affected. Unfortunately, there are no good mitgations for this.

## Workarounds

Unfortunately, nothing good.

Use of a transparent proxy over ones that require configuration is good practice.

## Description

In Octopus Deploy versions 3.0.19 to 2019.7.2, when a web request proxy is configured, an authenticated user (in certain limited circumstances) could trigger a deployment that writes the web request proxy password to the deployment log in cleartext. This is fixed in 2019.7.3. The fix was back-ported to LTS 2019.6.5 as well as LTS 2019.3.7.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
