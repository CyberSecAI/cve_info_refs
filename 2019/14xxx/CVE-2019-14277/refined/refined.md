  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Axway SecureTransport application's REST API `/api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword` endpoint is vulnerable to XML injection due to improper handling of XML data, specifically in the `resetPassword` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated XML Injection",
    "Blind XML External Entity (XXE) Injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation can lead to:\n    - Local file disclosure\n    - Denial of Service (DoS)\n    - URI invocation attacks (e.g., Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) which could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE))",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted XML payload to the `/api/v1.0/myself/resetPassword` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability unauthenticated and requires network access to the vulnerable API endpoint. No prior user knowledge or credentials are required."
