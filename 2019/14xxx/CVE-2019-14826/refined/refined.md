Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14826:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from FreeIPA not invalidating session cookies server-side upon user logout. While the server instructs the client (e.g., browser) to delete the cookie, it retains the session cookie in its server-side cache (ccache) until it naturally expires.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Session Cookie Reuse:**  A previously valid session cookie, even after logout, can be reused if obtained before the server-side cache entry expires, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access.
- **Lack of Server-Side Invalidation:** The server relies solely on the client to delete the cookie instead of also invalidating it server-side on logout.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker can impersonate a logged-out user by replaying the cached session cookie.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker can gain access to the user's session and perform actions as that user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Cookie Theft After Logout:** An attacker needs to obtain a valid session cookie after the user has logged out from an insecure browser or a client application.
- **Access to Debug Logs or Insecure Clients:** Attackers may obtain the session cookie through debug logs or from client applications that do not properly handle the cookie after logout.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have access to a previously valid session cookie of a user.
- The attacker must obtain the cookie after the user logs out but before the server-side credential cache expires.
- This vulnerability is more likely to be exploited when FreeIPA is accessed using non-standard methods or when the client is not following secure practices.

**Additional Information:**

- The issue was introduced in an upstream commit (b895f4a3) that addressed a different issue.
- The developers initially contested the severity and characterization of this issue as a vulnerability, arguing that the system works as designed and relies on browser behavior. However, Product Security classified it as a vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been marked as "CLOSED WONTFIX" with a low priority and severity
- Standard browsers delete cookies upon logout, which mitigates the issue, so only users using unusual automation methods or custom applications are likely affected.
