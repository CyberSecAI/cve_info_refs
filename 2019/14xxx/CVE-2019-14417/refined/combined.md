1.1: July 30, 2019: Added CVE IDs

1.2: July 31, 2019: Corrected affected versions for all issues, corrected severity on issue #4

### Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities in Veritas Resiliency Platform (VRP)

| Issue | Description | Severity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [1](#Issue1) | Directory traversal vulnerability related to uploading application bundles | Critical |
| [2](#Issue2) | Arbitrary command execution vulnerability with root privilege related to DNS server configuration | High |
| [3](#Issue3) | Arbitrary command execution vulnerability with root privilege related to resiliency plans and custom scripts | High |
| [4](#Issue4) | XSS vulnerability related to resiliency plans | Medium |

### Issues

#### Issue #1

When uploading an application bundle, a directory traversal vulnerability allows a VRP user with sufficient privileges to overwrite any file in the VRP virtual machine. A malicious VRP user could use this to replace existing files to take control of the VRP virtual machine.

CVE ID: [CVE-2019-14415](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14415)

Severity: Critical

CVSS v3 Base Score: 9.1 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H))

Affected Products

* All versions before VRP 3.3.2 HF14

#### Issue #2

An arbitrary command execution vulnerability allows a malicious VRP user to execute commands with root privilege within the VRP virtual machine, related to DNS functionality.

CVE ID: [CVE-2019-14416](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14416)

Severity: High

CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.2 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

Affected Products

* All versions before VRP 3.3.2 HF14

#### Issue #3

An arbitrary command execution vulnerability allows a malicious VRP user to execute commands with root privilege within the VRP virtual machine, related to resiliency plans and custom script functionality.

CVE ID: [CVE-2019-14417](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14417)

Severity: High

CVSS v3 Base Score: 7.2 ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

Affected Products

* All versions before VRP 3.3.2 HF14

#### Issue #4

A persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows a malicious VRP user to inject malicious script into another user’s browser, related to resiliency plans functionality.

### Questions

If you have any questions about any information in this security advisory please contact [Veritas technical support](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US.html).

### Best Practices

As part of normal best practices, Veritas recommends that customers:

* Restrict access of administration or management systems to privileged users.
* Restrict remote access, if required, to trusted/authorized systems only.
* Keep all operating systems and applications updated with the latest vendor patches.
* Follow a multi-layered approach to security. Run both firewall and anti-malware applications, at a minimum, to provide multiple points of detection and protection to both inbound and outbound threats.
* Deploy network and host-based intrusion detection systems to monitor network traffic for signs of anomalous or suspicious activity. This may aid in detection of attacks or malicious activity related to exploitation of latent vulnerabilities
