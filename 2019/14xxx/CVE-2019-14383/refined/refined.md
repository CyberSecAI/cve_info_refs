      "response": "The provided content relates to CVE-2019-14383.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from an assertion failure during the parsing of J2B files within the libopenmpt library, specifically when debug STLs are enabled. \n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\nThe vulnerability is triggered due to a flaw in the J2B file parsing logic within libopenmpt which leads to an assertion failure when processing specially crafted J2B files.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\nThe impact of this vulnerability is primarily a denial of service, as the assertion failure leads to a crash of the application using libopenmpt.  According to SUSE's assessment the impact is categorized as "Availability Impact: Partial" (CVSS v2) or "Availability Impact: High" (CVSS v3 by NVD) and "Availability Impact: Low" (CVSS v3 by SUSE) since it causes the application to terminate. There is no indication of any other impact such as information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\nThe attack vector is network-based, as a malicious actor can send a specially crafted J2B file to a vulnerable application, triggering the assertion failure. The application must process the untrusted input. \n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\nThe attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted J2B file to the vulnerable application. They also need to know that the application is using a vulnerable version of libopenmpt, that is configured to use debug STLs.",
