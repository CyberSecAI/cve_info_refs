{
  "CVE-2019-14907": {
    "Description": "Samba incorrectly handles character conversions when the log level is set to 3 or above. In certain environments, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect handling of character conversions when the log level is set to 3 or higher, causing a crash when printing the string to logs.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect character conversion",
      "Unvalidated string handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to a crash of the Samba process, particularly affecting long-lived processes like the RPC server in Samba AD DC.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote network connection",
       "NTLMSSP authentication exchange"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to send network requests to the Samba server.",
      "Ability to trigger the NTLMSSP authentication exchange",
       "Setting a log level of 3 or higher on target Samba server"
    ],
    "Additional Details": "The vulnerability is triggered during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange where the server attempts to convert the string received from the client and then prints it on log if conversion fails."
