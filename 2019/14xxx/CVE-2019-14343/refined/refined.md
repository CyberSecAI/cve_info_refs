  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2019-14343",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization within the TemaTres application, specifically when handling values related to the vocabulary administration.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the application. This could lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection of users to malicious websites.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack is executed through a crafted POST request to the `/tematres3.0/vocab/admin.php` endpoint. The malicious payload is inserted into the `value` parameter."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
       "The attacker needs a high privilege account to access and modify the vocabulary administration panel.",
        "The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the target server.",
         "The attacker requires knowledge of the specific parameter (`value`) to inject the payload."
      ],
       "details": "The vulnerability allows a stored XSS attack via the `value` parameter in the `admin.php` page. The attacker injects the payload `<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>` by crafting a POST request to `admin.php` with the malicious script injected as a value. The injected script will be executed when a user views the modified vocabulary list."
