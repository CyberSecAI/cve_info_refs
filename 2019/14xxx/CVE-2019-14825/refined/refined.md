Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-14825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- Registry credentials (username and password) were being captured in plain text during the repository discovery process within Katello. Specifically, during container image discovery, the credentials were logged without being masked in dynflow tasks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cleartext Storage:** The primary weakness is the storage of sensitive registry credentials in plain text format.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Exposure:** The vulnerability could expose the registry credentials to other privileged users who have access to the logs or dynflow tasks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Log Access:** An attacker with access to system logs could potentially read the credentials.
- **Dynflow Task Inspection:** Users with access to dynflow task details could view the unmasked credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to have privileged access to either system logs or the dynflow task details. This suggests that the attacker would likely need to be an internal actor or have already compromised a privileged account within the system.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in Red Hat Satellite 6.5.0, and was fixed in version tfm-rubygem-katello-3.12.0.9-1
- A Red Hat Security Advisory (RHSA-2019:3172) was issued to address this vulnerability.
- The fix involved ensuring that the registry passwords are encrypted.
- The issue was initially discovered in Red Hat Satellite but later found to be present in Katello as well.
