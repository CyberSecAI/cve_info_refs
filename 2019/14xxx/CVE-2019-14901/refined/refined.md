{
  "CVE-2019-14901": {
    "Description": "A heap overflow flaw was found in the Linux kernel's Marvell wifi chip driver. A heap overflow in  mwifiex_process_tdls_action_frame function in marvell/mwifiex/tdls.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service(system crash) or execute arbitrary code. The station receive a tdls setup request or respone frame which the EID_SUPP_RATES IE 's length is larger than 32 will cause Heap Overflow.",
    "Root cause": "A heap overflow in the mwifiex_process_tdls_action_frame function in drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/tdls.c due to an insufficient length check when processing EID_SUPP_RATES IE in a TDLS frame.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Heap overflow vulnerability",
      "Insufficient bounds check"
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code with root privileges. Can affect both confidentiality and integrity.",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending a crafted TDLS setup request or response frame with an EID_SUPP_RATES IE length greater than 32 bytes over the air.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Remote attacker with the ability to send crafted 802.11 frames to vulnerable stations using the Marvell wifi chip driver (mwifiex) with tdls support enabled."
