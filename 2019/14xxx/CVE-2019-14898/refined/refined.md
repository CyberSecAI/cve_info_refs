RELATES TO CVE-2019-14898

Based on the provided texts, the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-14898 is related to an incomplete fix for a race condition in the Linux kernel.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause:** Incomplete fix for a race condition between `mmget_not_zero()`/`get_task_mm()` and core dumping. The core dumping code runs without holding the `mmap_sem` for writing, leading to inconsistent vma layout if page faults occur concurrently.
*   **Weakness:** The core dumping mechanism doesn't properly serialize with memory management operations, specifically those that modify the VMA layout.
*   **Impact:**
    *   A local user could exploit this flaw.
    *   Sensitive information disclosure.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Possibly other unspecified impacts.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggering a race condition with `mmget_not_zero` or `get_task_mm` calls.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Local user.
*   **Affected components:** core kernel
*   **Mitigation:** Applying the complete fix.
*   **Affected Systems:** RHEL 7 kernel versions before Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7 GA kernel (version 3.10.0-1062 released via RHSA-2019:2029) were never affected.
*   **Fixes:** The provided commits address this race condition by preventing deadlocks and ensuring data consistency during core dumping. The main fix is commit `bb461ad8e6e0653fc6bd0f26d9173bab0aec235b` ("coredump: fix race condition between mmget\_not\_zero()/get\_task\_mm() and core dumping").
