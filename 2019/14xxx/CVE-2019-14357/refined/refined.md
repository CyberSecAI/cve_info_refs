Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-14357:

*   **Vulnerability:** Side-channel attack on the OLED screen controller (SSD1305) used in the Mooltipass Mini.

*   **Root Cause:** The OLED screen's row scanning display technique leads to varying power consumption based on the number of pixels switched on in each row. By analyzing the device's dynamic power consumption, an attacker can potentially infer the information displayed on the screen (PIN digits).

*   **Attack Vector:** The documented attack implementation involves:
    *   Physical access to the user's environment.
    *   A modified USB cable with a 5-ohm shunt resistor on the ground return.
    *   Measuring the voltage across the shunt resistor and feeding it into a low-priced sound card input.
    *   Performing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the sound card data.
    *   Visually analyzing the FFT output to identify patterns corresponding to the PIN digits displayed on the Mooltipass Mini screen.

*   **Impact:** An attacker could potentially determine the user's PIN by analyzing the power consumption of the Mooltipass Mini while the PIN is being entered.

*   **Limitations:**
    *   Requires physical access to the device.
    *   Requires a modified USB cable with embedded processing capabilities.
    *   Requires a covert method for exporting the processing results.
    *   At the time of the statement, only visual analysis of power consumption had been demonstrated; algorithmic recognition was not achieved.

*   **Mitigation:** The Mooltipass team implemented a mitigation technique of constant row pixel count. When asking for the user's PIN, additional pixels are added to the display to maintain a constant row pixel count across the section of the screen displaying the PIN digits. Firmware updates containing this mitigation are available upon request.
