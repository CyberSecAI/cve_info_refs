{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-14360",
  "affected_products": [
    "Hyundai-Pay Kasse HK-1000",
    "BitBox02"
  ],
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a side-channel leak through the USB power line during OLED display operation. The current consumption of the OLED display varies depending on the number of illuminated pixels on each row, which can be measured to potentially reconstruct the displayed content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability",
      "Information leakage",
      "OLED display power consumption correlation with displayed content."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with physical access can potentially recover sensitive information such as PIN codes or BIP39 mnemonic words displayed on the OLED screen by analyzing the device's power consumption.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Physical access to the device's USB cable or port",
      "Power consumption analysis using specialized equipment (e.g., oscilloscope, software-defined radio)",
    ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "Requires physical access to the device and specialized equipment to measure power consumption. Attacker needs to convince victim to enter sensitive data while connected to their setup."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The provided document highlights that while the BitBox02 is affected by the OLED side-channel vulnerability, Shift Crypto was aware of the issue and has taken some mitigation steps. The BC Vault team stated that their device does not display any confidential information besides the PIN length, so the impact of this attack is low in their case."
