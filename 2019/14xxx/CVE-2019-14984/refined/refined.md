Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14984:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper access control in the 'XML-API' AddOn for eQ-3 Homematic CCU2 and CCU3 devices. Specifically, the `/addons/xmlapi/exec.cgi` script executes TCL (Tool Command Language) code from an HTTP POST request without proper authentication or authorization checks. This allows for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of access control on the `/addons/xmlapi/exec.cgi` script. This allows unauthenticated users to execute arbitrary TCL code.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** The ability to execute arbitrary TCL code leads directly to remote code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system, potentially gaining full control. This includes actions such as reading sensitive data, modifying system configurations, installing malicious software, or causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP POST request to the `/addons/xmlapi/exec.cgi` endpoint, with the TCL code payload within the request data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the Homematic CCU device.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Target must have the XML-API AddOn installed**

**Technical Details:**

*   The `exec.cgi` script executes TCL code within a `system.Exec()` call, allowing for OS command execution directly.
*   The `exec.cgi` script takes TCL commands in the HTTP POST data, such as `var x=system.Exec("sleep 4;");` or  `var x=system.Exec("/bin/touch /tmp/testfile;");`, illustrating how system commands can be injected and executed.
*   The document also shows examples how to leverage the CUxD addon if installed to execute commands, by using `dom.GetObject("CUxD.CUX2801001:1.CMD_EXEC").State("/bin/touch /tmp/testfile");`

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was disclosed on August 13, 2019, by psytester.
*   The vendor (eQ-3) was contacted on Feb 13, 2019, but responded stating that they are not responsible for AddOns.
*   The developer of the XML-API AddOn was contacted in March 2019.
*   A GitHub pull request for a fix was created in May 2019, but the fix was still not applied at the time of publishing this write up.
