{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `CmkjPlayer::load()` function, located in the `mkj.cpp` file within the AdPlug library.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The heap-based buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted `.mkj` file to the vulnerable function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted `.mkj` file to the application using the vulnerable AdPlug library. This could be achieved through various means, such as tricking a user into opening a malicious file or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject the file."
