Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e
2020-05-29 02:26:09.211820
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : dnsmasq
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 2.80
Release : 15.fc31
URL : <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/>
Summary : A lightweight DHCP/caching DNS server
Description :
Dnsmasq is lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder and DHCP server.
It is designed to provide DNS and, optionally, DHCP, to a small network.
It can serve the names of local machines which are not in the global
DNS. The DHCP server integrates with the DNS server and allows machines
with DHCP-allocated addresses to appear in the DNS with names configured
either in each host or in a central configuration file. Dnsmasq supports
static and dynamic DHCP leases and BOOTP for network booting of diskless
machines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Fixes possible memory leak and regression with multiple dhcp-host lines with
different address family and the same mac address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Mon May 11 2020 Petr Menï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½k pemensik@redhat.com - 2.80-15

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-10-23 04:13:39 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in dnsmsq before version 2.81, where the memory leak allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving DHCP response creation.  Upstream patch:  <http://thekelleys.org.uk/gitweb/?p=dnsmasq.git;a=commit;h=69bc94779c2f035a9fffdb5327a54c3aeca73ed5>  References:  <http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-10-23 04:16:37 UTC  ``` Created dnsmasq tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1764426](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-14834 dnsmasq: memory leak in in a infinite while(1) loop in the create_helper() function in /src/helper.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c3)  Joshua Padman    2019-12-13 00:25:39 UTC  ``` Statement:  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, which currently supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.7, the dnsmasq package is pulled directly from the rhel-7-server-rpms channel. Red Hat OpenStack Platform's version is therefore unused, please ensure that the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux dnsmasq package is current.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c6)  Marco Benatto    2020-01-28 13:27:12 UTC  ``` There's a flaw on dnsmasq which allows an attacker to cause DoS by sending specially crafted DHCP responses. The malicious responses triggers a memory leak on create_helper() function under certain conditions leading the process to run out of memory. The availability impact is considered High as it denies the service for all users/systems depending on the affected dnsmasq instance, however the Attack Complexity can be considered High as a successful attack depends on a specific configuration.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c7)  Marco Benatto    2020-01-29 13:34:48 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Xu Mingjie (varas@IIE)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c8)  TomÃ¡Å¡ Hozza    2020-02-17 11:16:47 UTC  ``` Hi. Do we have a reproducer?   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c9)  Doran Moppert    2020-02-18 23:45:43 UTC  ``` We don't have a reproducer; making a reliable one for QE would be a lot of work when the patch is so straightforward :).   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c10)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-04-28 15:44:00 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2020:1715 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1715](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1715)   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1764425#c11)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-04-28 16:34:27 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

This will include the bug IDs of this tracking bug as well as the relevant top-level CVE bugs.  Please also mention the CVE IDs being fixed in the RPM changelog and the fedpkg commit message.  NOTE: this issue affects multiple supported versions of Fedora. While only one tracking bug has been filed, please correct all affected versions at the same time.  If you need to fix the versions independent of each other, you may clone this bug as appropriate.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426#c1)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-10-23 04:16:32 UTC  ``` Use the following template to for the 'fedpkg update' request to submit an update for this issue as it contains the top-level parent bug(s) as well as this tracking bug.  This will ensure that all associated bugs get updated when new packages are pushed to stable.  =====  # bugfix, security, enhancement, newpackage (required) type=security  # low, medium, high, urgent (required) severity=low  # testing, stable request=testing  # Bug numbers: 1234,9876 bugs=1764425,1764426  # Description of your update notes=Security fix for [PUT CVEs HERE]  # Enable request automation based on the stable/unstable karma thresholds autokarma=True stable_karma=3 unstable_karma=-3  # Automatically close bugs when this marked as stable close_bugs=True  # Suggest that users restart after update suggest_reboot=False  ======  Additionally, you may opt to use the bodhi web interface to submit updates:  <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/new>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426#c2)  Ben Cotton    2020-04-30 20:54:10 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 30 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 30 on 2020-05-26. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '30'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 30 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426#c3)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-13 10:52:22 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e has been submitted as an update to Fedora 31. <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426#c4)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-14 06:07:01 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e has been pushed to the Fedora 31 testing repository. In short time you'll be able to install the update with the following command: `sudo dnf upgrade --enablerepo=updates-testing --advisory=FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e` You can provide feedback for this update here: <https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e>  See also [https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA:Updates_Testing](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/QA%3AUpdates_Testing) for more information on how to test updates.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426#c5)  Ben Cotton    2020-05-26 14:29:38 UTC  ``` Fedora 30 changed to end-of-life (EOL) status on 2020-05-26. Fedora 30 is no longer maintained, which means that it will not receive any further security or bug fix updates. As a result we are closing this bug.  If you can reproduce this bug against a currently maintained version of Fedora please feel free to reopen this bug against that version. If you are unable to reopen this bug, please file a new report against the current release. If you experience problems, please add a comment to this bug.  Thank you for reporting this bug and we are sorry it could not be fixed.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1764426#c6)  Fedora Update System    2020-05-29 02:26:23 UTC  ``` FEDORA-2020-29b442f83e has been pushed to the Fedora 31 stable repository. If problem still persists, please make note of it in this bug report.   ``` |  |
