```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a memory leak within the `create_helper()` function located in `/src/helper.c` of the dnsmasq application.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak in the `create_helper()` function.",
      "Improper handling of DHCP response creation."
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can trigger a denial-of-service condition by sending specially crafted DHCP responses to the dnsmasq server. The memory leak leads to excessive memory consumption, potentially causing the process to terminate and disrupt the service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending specially crafted DHCP responses to the dnsmasq server."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted DHCP responses to the dnsmasq server. The attack is dependent on the dnsmasq configuration, specifically the domain name set in the `dnsmasq.conf` file."
