- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of output when displaying certain block labels created by administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious block label. When an administrator interacts with the crafted label while administering a layout, the malicious script could execute in the administrator's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the permission to create custom blocks could create a block with a malicious label. An administrator would then have to view the layout containing the malicious block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the permission to create custom blocks, typically an administrative privilege.
