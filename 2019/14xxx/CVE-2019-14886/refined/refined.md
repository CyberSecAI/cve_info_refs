Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way passwords are stored within the `errai_security_context` of the `business-central` application. Instead of using proper encryption, the passwords were being encoded using Base64.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Storage:** Passwords were stored using Base64 encoding, which is not an encryption method and is easily reversible.
- **Exposure of Credentials:** Because Base64 is an encoding, not encryption, it's possible for unauthorized users to decode the passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the exposure of user passwords, allowing unauthorized access to user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector isn't detailed in this content but it would involve gaining access to the `errai_security_context` where the encoded passwords reside. This access would then allow an attacker to decode those passwords.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need access to the `errai_security_context` where Base64 encoded passwords are kept. The content does not specify how this access could be achieved.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the `business-central` application.
- The issue has been addressed in Red Hat Process Automation via RHSA-2020:0132 and Red Hat Decision Manager via RHSA-2020:0133.
- The bug report mentions the use of base64, not an encryption algorithm, which highlights the core weakness.
