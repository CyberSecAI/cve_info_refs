RELATED: CVE-2019-14969

Vulnerability Type: Privilege Escalation

Affected Products: Netwrix Auditor version 9.7 and earlier

Summary: Netwrix Auditor version 9.7 and earlier suffer from insecure file permissions on `C:\ProgramData\Netwrix Auditor\Logs\ActiveDirectory\` directory and its sub-folders. The service `Netwrix.ADA.StorageAuditService` writes to this directory but does not perform proper impersonation. This means that the target file will have the same permissions as the invoking process, granting `Authenticated Users` full access over the target file. This vulnerability can be triggered by a low-privileged user to perform DLL Hijacking/Binary Planting attacks and ultimately execute code as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` with the help of Symbolic Links.

Root cause of vulnerability: Insecure file permissions and improper impersonation.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Insecure file permissions on the specified directory and its sub-folders.
- The `Netwrix.ADA.StorageAuditService` service does not perform proper impersonation.

Impact of exploitation: Privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`

Attack vectors: DLL Hijacking/Binary Planting attacks with the help of Symbolic Links.

Required attacker capabilities/position: Low-privileged user.
