Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-14855:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the ability to create chosen-prefix collisions in the SHA-1 hashing algorithm. This allows an attacker to craft two different messages with different prefixes that produce the same SHA-1 hash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SHA-1 Collision Vulnerability:** The SHA-1 algorithm is susceptible to chosen-prefix collision attacks.
*   **OpenPGP Key Certification Forgery:**  GnuPG's use of SHA-1 for key certifications, particularly in older versions and when using DSA 1024 keys, makes it vulnerable to key forgeries.
*   **Web of Trust Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to forge key signatures, potentially undermining the Web of Trust model by allowing them to impersonate other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Key Forgery:** An attacker can create a malicious PGP key with a forged certificate that appears to be signed by a trusted third party.
*   **Impersonation:** With a forged key, an attacker can impersonate another user in the Web of Trust, allowing them to sign documents or emails as if they were the legitimate user.
*   **Undermining Trust:** The successful exploitation of this vulnerability can undermine the entire Web of Trust model.
*  **Downgrade Attacks:** Even with low usage of SHA-1, the fact that it's allowed creates a possibility for man-in-the-middle attacks to downgrade a connection to use the insecure SHA-1.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Chosen-Prefix Collision:** The attacker leverages the chosen-prefix collision attack on SHA-1 to create colliding certificates for two different PGP keys. The attacker crafts a legitimate key (Key B) and a forged key (Key A).
*   **Key Signing Manipulation:** The attacker obtains a signature for Key B from a trusted third party. Due to the SHA-1 collision, this signature is also valid for Key A which can have a different identity.
*   **Web of Trust Exploitation:** The attacker distributes the forged Key A, which now appears to be signed by a trusted third party allowing the attacker to impersonate the user associated with Key A.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Computational Resources:** The attacker needs significant computational resources, typically achieved through GPU clusters, to generate the chosen-prefix collision for SHA-1. This requires renting GPU resources which, in 2020, cost around $45,000 USD.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs in-depth knowledge of cryptography, the SHA-1 algorithm, and the structure of PGP certificates to successfully execute the attack.
*  **Access to a Certification Authority:** To perform a full impersonation attack, an attacker needs to get a signature on the legitimate key B.
*  **Knowledge of PGP:**  The attacker needs an understanding of how PGP certificates and the Web of Trust model function.

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability has been mitigated in GnuPG by:

*   **Disabling SHA-1 Signatures:**  GnuPG version 2.2.18 and later rejects all SHA-1 based key signatures created after 2019-01-19 by default in the web-of-trust.
*   **New Option for Compatibility:** A new option `--allow-weak-key-signatures` is available to revert to the older behavior for environments where SHA-1 signatures are still necessary.
*   **Preventing New SHA-1 Signatures:** GnuPG no longer allows creation of new third-party SHA-1 key signatures.
*   **Backports:** Patches have been created for older versions of GnuPG in several Linux distributions.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided documents show that the chosen prefix collision attack on SHA-1 has become practical. It shows a transition from a theoretical attack to a practical one with the possibility of it becoming even cheaper in the future.
*   The research team that discovered the chosen-prefix collision publicly released their findings which triggered patches across other systems.
*   The vulnerability also impacts other software such as OpenSSL, OpenSSH, and DNSSEC, although GnuPG is the main focus of the provided documents.
*   The attack highlights the importance of deprecating vulnerable algorithms like SHA-1.
