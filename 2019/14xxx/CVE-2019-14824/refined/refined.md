```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The 'deref' plugin in 389-ds-base was using the 'search' permission to display attribute values, instead of requiring 'read' permissions.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: An insufficient permission check in the 'deref' plugin allowed authenticated attackers to view private attributes.
- Impact of exploitation: An authenticated attacker could view sensitive attributes, such as password hashes.
- Attack vectors: An authenticated attacker could exploit the deref plugin to display attributes for which they only have 'search' permissions.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be authenticated and have 'search' permissions. In some environments, this permission is granted by default.
