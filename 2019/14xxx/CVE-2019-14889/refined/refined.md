  "CVE-2019-14889": {
    "description": "A flaw was found with the libssh API function ssh_scp_new() in versions before 0.9.3 and before 0.8.8. When the libssh SCP client connects to a server, the scp command, which includes a user-provided path, is executed on the server-side. In case the library is used in a way where users can influence the third parameter of the function, it would become possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the remote target.",
    "affected_components": [
      "libssh API function ssh_scp_new()",
      "libssh SCP client"
    ],
    "root_cause": "Insufficient sanitization of user-provided paths in the scp command executed on the server-side.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Unsanitized input",
      "Arbitrary command execution"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
    "attack_vector": "A specially crafted scp command.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A user or automated system needs to be tricked into using a malicious scp command, which includes a user-provided path.",
    "patches": [
      "Reformat code in scp/scp.c.",
      "Log SCP warnings received from the server in src/scp.c.",
      "Add function to quote file names in include/libssh/misc.h, src/misc.c.",
