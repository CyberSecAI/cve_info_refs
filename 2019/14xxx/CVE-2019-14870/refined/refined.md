{
  "CVE-2019-14870": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Samba AD DC did not enforce the `delegation_not_allowed` user attribute during S4U2Self (protocol transition) requests. This attribute is intended to prevent clients from being delegated, making their tickets non-forwardable. However, the Samba AD DC was setting the forwardable flag even when the impersonated client had the `not-delegated` flag set.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of the `delegation_not_allowed` attribute during S4U2Self requests, leading to tickets being incorrectly marked as forwardable.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially bypass intended delegation restrictions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources by impersonating a user with the `delegation_not_allowed` attribute set.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the S4U2Self Kerberos protocol, where a client requests a service ticket to impersonate another user.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to initiate S4U2Self Kerberos requests, which typically requires some level of prior authentication or access within the domain, although, in some cases, it can also occur due to misconfiguration."
