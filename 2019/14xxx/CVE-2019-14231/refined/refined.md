The content provided describes two SQL injection vulnerabilities, with CVE-2019-14231 assigned to the second vulnerability.

**CVE-2019-14231 Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `id` parameter in the `set_count` AJAX handler. The `id` parameter is directly used in a SQL query within the `saveQuestionVote` function without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**  SQL Injection vulnerability, caused by unsanitized input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can perform SQL injection, potentially leading to remote code execution and information disclosure.
*  **Attack Vectors:** By crafting a malicious `id` parameter in the `set_count` AJAX request, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges. They can perform the attack remotely by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.

**Technical Details (from the provided content):**

*   **Affected Component:** The `set_count` AJAX handler of the "Viral Quiz Maker - Onionbuzz" WordPress plugin.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `id` parameter.
*   **Vulnerable Function:** `saveQuestionVote`.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):**
    ```
    curl <http://site/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?type=set_count> --data
    "action=ob_question_votes&id=1 or sleep(10);#"
    ```
    This PoC demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection by using `sleep(10)`.
*   **Affected versions:** Prior to v1.2.7
