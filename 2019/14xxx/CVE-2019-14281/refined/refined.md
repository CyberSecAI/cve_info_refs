Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14281:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A malicious backdoor was inserted into the `datagrid` gem, specifically in version 1.0.6. The malicious code was located in `datagrid-1.0.6/lib/datagrid/drivers/abstract_driver.rb`. This was not a vulnerability in the original code, but a malicious modification by a third party.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Malicious Code Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a code-execution backdoor, meaning an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** A third party was able to inject malicious code into a seemingly legitimate package.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The malicious code allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Total Loss of Confidentiality:**  Attackers can access all resources within the impacted component and steal sensitive information like administrator passwords or private encryption keys.
*   **Total Loss of Integrity:** Attackers can modify any/all files protected by the impacted component, leading to potential data corruption or manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable and can be triggered over the network.
*   **Package Installation:** The attack vector is through the installation of the compromised gem version 1.0.6.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Prior Authorization Needed:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the system.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable server via network.
*   **Ability to inject malicious code:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the package, as it was the case here.

**Additional Details:**
*   The `datagrid` gem is used for building data tables with sortable columns and filters.
*   The malicious version (1.0.6) was yanked from RubyGems.org to prevent further installations.

This vulnerability is similar to the bootstrap-sass malware incident.
