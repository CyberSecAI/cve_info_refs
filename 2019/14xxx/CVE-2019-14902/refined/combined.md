Package        : samba
Version        : 2:4.5.16+dfsg-1+deb9u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-10218 CVE-2019-14833 CVE-2019-14847 CVE-2019-14861
                 CVE-2019-14870 CVE-2019-14902 CVE-2019-14907 CVE-2021-20254
Debian Bug     : 946786

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Samba, SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix

CVE-2019-10218

    A flaw was found in the samba client, where a malicious server can
    supply a pathname to the client with separators. This could allow
    the client to access files and folders outside of the SMB network
    pathnames. An attacker could use this vulnerability to create
    files outside of the current working directory using the
    privileges of the client user.

CVE-2019-14833

    A flaw was found in Samba, in the way it handles a user password
    change or a new password for a samba user. The Samba Active
    Directory Domain Controller can be configured to use a custom
    script to check for password complexity. This configuration can
    fail to verify password complexity when non-ASCII characters are
    used in the password, which could lead to weak passwords being set
    for samba users, making it vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

CVE-2019-14847

    A flaw was found in samba where an attacker can crash AD DC LDAP
    server via dirsync resulting in denial of service. Privilege
    escalation is not possible with this issue.

CVE-2019-14861

    Samba have an issue, where the (poorly named) dnsserver RPC pipe
    provides administrative facilities to modify DNS records and
    zones. Samba, when acting as an AD DC, stores DNS records in LDAP.
    In AD, the default permissions on the DNS partition allow creation
    of new records by authenticated users. This is used for example to
    allow machines to self-register in DNS. If a DNS record was
    created that case-insensitively matched the name of the zone, the
    ldb_qsort() and dns_name_compare() routines could be confused into
    reading memory prior to the list of DNS entries when responding to
    DnssrvEnumRecords() or DnssrvEnumRecords2() and so following
    invalid memory as a pointer.

CVE-2019-14870

    Samba have an issue, where the S4U (MS-SFU) Kerberos delegation
    model includes a feature allowing for a subset of clients to be
    opted out of constrained delegation in any way, either S4U2Self or
    regular Kerberos authentication, by forcing all tickets for these
    clients to be non-forwardable. In AD this is implemented by a user
    attribute delegation_not_allowed (aka not-delegated), which
    translates to disallow-forwardable. However the Samba AD DC does
    not do that for S4U2Self and does set the forwardable flag even if
    the impersonated client has the not-delegated flag set.

CVE-2019-14902

    There is an issue in samba, where the removal of the right to
    create or modify a subtree would not automatically be taken away
    on all domain controllers.

CVE-2019-14907

    samba have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or
    above) then the string obtained from the client, after a failed
    character conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided
    during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in
    particular, this may cause a long-lived process(such as the RPC
    server) to terminate. (In the file server case, the most likely
    target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).

CVE-2021-20254

    A flaw was found in samba. The Samba smbd file server must map
    Windows group identities (SIDs) into unix group ids (gids). The
    code that performs this had a flaw that could allow it to read
    data beyond the end of the array in the case where a negative
    cache entry had been added to the mapping cache. This could cause
    the calling code to return those values into the process token
    that stores the group membership for a user. The highest threat
    from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2:4.5.16+dfsg-1+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

Debian Bug     :

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Samba, the SMB/CIFS file, print, and
login server for Unix.

CVE-2016-2124

    A flaw was found in the way samba implemented SMB1 authentication. An
    attacker could use this flaw to retrieve the plaintext password sent over
    the wire even if Kerberos authentication was required.

CVE-2019-10218

    A flaw was found in the samba client, all samba versions before samba
    4.11.2, 4.10.10 and 4.9.15, where a malicious server can supply a pathname
    to the client with separators. This could allow the client to access files
    and folders outside of the SMB network pathnames. An attacker could use this
    vulnerability to create files outside of the current working directory using
    the privileges of the client user.

CVE-2019-14833

    A flaw was found in Samba, all versions starting samba 4.5.0 before samba
    4.9.15, samba 4.10.10, samba 4.11.2, in the way it handles a user password
    change or a new password for a samba user. The Samba Active Directory Domain
    Controller can be configured to use a custom script to check for password
    complexity. This configuration can fail to verify password complexity when
    non-ASCII characters are used in the password, which could lead to weak
    passwords being set for samba users, making it vulnerable to dictionary
    attacks.

CVE-2019-14847

    A flaw was found in samba 4.0.0 before samba 4.9.15 and samba 4.10.x before
    4.10.10. An attacker can crash AD DC LDAP server via dirsync resulting in
    denial of service. Privilege escalation is not possible with this issue.

CVE-2019-14902

    There is an issue in all samba 4.11.x versions before 4.11.5, all samba
    4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18,
    where the removal of the right to create or modify a subtree would not
    automatically be taken away on all domain controllers.

CVE-2019-14907

    All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x
    before 4.11.5 have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or
    above) then the string obtained from the client, after a failed character
    conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP
    authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a
    long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file server
    case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a
    crash there is harmless).

CVE-2019-19344

    There is a use-after-free issue in all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18,
    all samba 4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.11.x versions
    before 4.11.5, essentially due to a call to realloc() while other local
    variables still point at the original buffer.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2:4.9.5+dfsg-5+deb10u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.

Admins of AD DC setups are reminded and strongly encouraged to upgrade to
bullseye and then bookworm, as AD DC setups are unsupported in buster since [DSA
5015-1], and in bullseye since [DSA 5477-1].

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1791201#c0)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2020-01-15 08:35:07 UTC  ``` As per upstream advisory:  A newly delegated right, but more importantly the removal of a delegated right, would not be inherited on any DC other than the one where the change was made.  For example:  - if a user or group was previously delegated the right to create or modify a subtree (say to allow desktop support to reset passwords and create users)  - and subsequently this right was taken away  The removal would not automatically be taken away on all domain controllers.  Because this patch only fixes new replication into the future, it is vital that a full-sync be done TO each Domain controller to ensure each ACL (ntSecurityDescriptor) is re-calculated on the whole set of DCs.

[ctdb](/ubuntu/xenial/%2Bpackage/ctdb):
clustered database to store temporary data

CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other

 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for

 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware

 and use CTDB instead.

 .

 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,

 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.

 .

 Features include:

  \* CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across

    all nodes in a cluster.

  \* CTDB is very fast.

  \* In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB

    databases that it manages.

  \* CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with

    Samba3/4.

debug symbols for package ctdb

CTDB is a cluster implementation of the TDB database used by Samba and other

 projects to store temporary data. If an application is already using TDB for

 temporary data it is very easy to convert that application to be cluster aware

 and use CTDB instead.

 .

 CTDB provides the same types of functions as TDB but in a clustered fashion,

 providing a TDB-style database that spans multiple physical hosts in a cluster.

 .

 Features include:

  \* CTDB provides a TDB that has consistent data and consistent locking across

    all nodes in a cluster.

  \* CTDB is very fast.

  \* In case of node failures, CTDB will automatically recover and repair all TDB

    databases that it manages.

  \* CTDB is the core component that provides pCIFS ("parallel CIFS") with

    Samba3/4.

# USN-4244-1: Samba vulnerabilities

21 January 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Samba.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [samba](/security/cves?package=samba) - SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix

## Details

It was discovered that Samba did not automatically replicate ACLs set to

inherit down a subtree on AD Directory, contrary to expectations. This

issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu

19.10. ([CVE-2019-14902](/security/CVE-2019-14902))

Robert Święcki discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain character

conversions when the log level is set to 3 or above. In certain

environments, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause

Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-14907](/security/CVE-2019-14907))

Christian Naumer discovered that Samba incorrectly handled DNS zone

scavenging. This issue could possibly result in some incorrect data being

written to the DB. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 19.04 and Ubuntu

19.10. ([CVE-2019-19344](/security/CVE-2019-19344))

## CVE-2019-14902.html:

```

===========================================================
== Subject:     Replication of ACLs set to inherit down a
==              subtree on AD Directory not automatic
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2019-14902
==
== Versions:    Samba 4.0 and later
==
== Summary:     The implementation of ACL inheritance in the
==              Samba AD DC was not complete, and so absent a
==              'full-sync' replication, ACLs could get out of
==              sync between domain controllers.
===========================================================

===========
Description
===========

A newly delegated right, but more importantly the removal of a
delegated right, would not be inherited on any DC other than the one
where the change was made.

For example:
 - if a user or group was previously delegated the right to
create or modify a subtree (say to allow desktop support to reset
passwords and create users)
 - and subsequently this right was taken away

The removal would not automatically be taken away on all domain
controllers.

Because this patch only fixes new replication into the future, it is
vital that a full-sync be done TO each Domain Controller to ensure
each ACL (ntSecurityDescriptor) is re-calculated on the whole set of
DCs.  See the instructions in "workaround and required steps
post-upgrade" below.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba 4.11.5, 4.10.12 and 4.9.18 have been issued
as security releases to correct the defect.  Samba administrators are
advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon
as possible.

==================
CVSSv3 calculation
==================

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4)

==========================================
Workaround and required steps post-upgrade
==========================================

Use of 'samba-tool drs replicate $DC1 $DC2 $NC --full-sync' will cause
all ACLs to be syncronised from DC2 to DC1, for the given NC (naming
context), eg:

samba-tool drs replicate my-DC1 my-DC2 DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync
samba-tool drs replicate my-DC1 my-DC2 CN=Configuration,DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync

samba-tool drs replicate my-DC2 my-DC1 DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync
samba-tool drs replicate my-DC2 my-DC1 CN=Configuration,DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync

Internally both in patched and un-patched versions, for every object
replicated with a --full-sync, the inheritance will be correctly
calculated.  This only needs to be done TO each DC, not for each
pair-wise pair.

Reported by a number of Samba users and sites since 2017, but now
recognised as a security issue after triage.  We apologise for the
delay in dealing with this issue.

* [Security Advisory](security/advisory)
# Synology-SA-20:01 Samba

Publish Time: 2020-01-22 17:52:36 UTC+8

Last Updated: 2022-08-29 14:33:28 UTC+8

Severity
Moderate

Status
Accepted

**Abstract**

Multiple vulnerabilities allow remote authenticated users to bypass security constraints via a susceptible version of Synology Directory Server or allow remote attackers to conduct denial-of-service attacks via a susceptible version of DiskStation Manager (DSM) or Synology Router Manager (SRM).

None of Synology products are affected by CVE-2019-19344 as the vulnerability only affects Samba 4.9 and later.

**Affected Products**

| Product | Severity | Fixed Release Availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DSM 6.2 | Moderate | Upgrade to 6.2.4-25554 or above. |
| SRM 1.2 | Moderate | Pending |
| VS Firmware 2.3 | Not affected | N/A |
| Synology Directory Server for DSM 6.2 | Moderate | Upgrade DSM 6.2 to 6.2.4-25554 or above. |

**Mitigation**

None

**Detail**

* CVE-2019-14902

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 6.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L)
  + There is an issue in all samba 4.11.x versions before 4.11.5, all samba 4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18, where the removal of the right to create or modify a subtree would not automatically be taken away on all domain controllers.
* CVE-2019-14907

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 5.9
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
  + All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x before 4.11.5 have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or above) then the string obtained from the client, after a failed character conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file server case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).
* CVE-2019-19344

  + Severity: Not affected
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 0.0
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:N)
  + There is a use-after-free issue in all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18, all samba 4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.11.x versions before 4.11.5, essentially due to a call to realloc() while other local variables still point at the original buffer.

# CVE-2019-14907

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14906.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14970.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14907 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14907)

#### Description

All samba versions 4.9.x before 4.9.18, 4.10.x before 4.10.12 and 4.11.x before 4.11.5 have an issue where if it is set with "log level = 3" (or above) then the string obtained from the client, after a failed character conversion, is printed. Such strings can be provided during the NTLMSSP authentication exchange. In the Samba AD DC in particular, this may cause a long-lived process(such as the RPC server) to terminate. (In the file server case, the most likely target, smbd, operates as process-per-client and so a crash there is harmless).

| [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1160850#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2020-01-21 11:03:29 UTC  ``` is public  <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2019-14902.html>   CVE-2019-14902.html  =========================================================== == Subject:     Replication of ACLs set to inherit down a ==              subtree on AD Directory not automatic == == CVE ID#:     CVE-2019-14902  == == Versions:    Samba 4.0 and later == == Summary:     The implementation of ACL inheritance in the ==              Samba AD DC was not complete, and so absent a ==              'full-sync' replication, ACLs could get out of ==              sync between domain controllers. ===========================================================  =========== Description ===========  A newly delegated right, but more importantly the removal of a delegated right, would not be inherited on any DC other than the one where the change was made.  For example:  - if a user or group was previously delegated the right to create or modify a subtree (say to allow desktop support to reset passwords and create users)  - and subsequently this right was taken away  The removal would not automatically be taken away on all domain controllers.  Because this patch only fixes new replication into the future, it is vital that a full-sync be done TO each Domain Controller to ensure each ACL (ntSecurityDescriptor) is re-calculated on the whole set of DCs.  See the instructions in "workaround and required steps post-upgrade" below.  ================== Patch Availability ==================  Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:      <https://www.samba.org/samba/security/>  Additionally, Samba 4.11.5, 4.10.12 and 4.9.18 have been issued as security releases to correct the defect.  Samba administrators are advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon as possible.  ================== CVSSv3 calculation ==================  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N (5.4)  ========================================== Workaround and required steps post-upgrade ==========================================  Use of 'samba-tool drs replicate $DC1 $DC2 $NC --full-sync' will cause all ACLs to be syncronised from DC2 to DC1, for the given NC (naming context), eg:  samba-tool drs replicate my-DC1 my-DC2 DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync  samba-tool drs replicate my-DC1 my-DC2 CN=Configuration,DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync   samba-tool drs replicate my-DC2 my-DC1 DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync  samba-tool drs replicate my-DC2 my-DC1 CN=Configuration,DC=samba,DC=example,DC=com --full-sync  Internally both in patched and un-patched versions, for every object replicated with a --full-sync, the inheritance will be correctly calculated.  This only needs to be done TO each DC, not for each pair-wise pair.  ======= Credits =======  Reported by a number of Samba users and sites since 2017, but now recognised as a security issue after triage.  We apologise for the delay in dealing with this issue.  Patches provided by Andrew Bartlett of the Samba Team and Catalyst.  Advisory written by Andrew Bartlett of the Samba Team and Catalyst.  ========================================================== == Our Code, Our Bugs, Our Responsibility. == The Samba Team ========================================================== ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1160850#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-23 20:11:23 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:0223-1: An update that solves three vulnerabilities and has one errata is now available.
