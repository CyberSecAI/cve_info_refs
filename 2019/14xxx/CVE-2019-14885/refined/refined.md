**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (the security attribute value of a system property) is being exposed in the server logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Confidential Information:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of sensitive data that is supposed to be protected by the Vault system. This could include passwords, API keys, or other secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute the JBoss CLI `reload` command. This typically implies having some level of access to the system or the ability to interact with the JBoss management interface.
