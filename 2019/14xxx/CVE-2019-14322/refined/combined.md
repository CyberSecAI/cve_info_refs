# Werkzeug 0.15.5 Released

Posted by David Lord on 2019-07-17

---

Werkzeug 0.15.5 has been released, containing bug and security fixes.
The [changelog](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/page/changes/#version-0-15-5) lists the changes in detail, which include:

* `SharedDataMiddleware` safely handles drive names in paths on Windows.
* The reloader no longer causes an `Exec format error` in many common
  situations.
* The reloader works around an issue when using the pydev debugger.

## Security fix for `SharedDataMiddleware` on Windows [¶](#security-fix-for-shareddatamiddleware-on-windows)

Prior to 0.15.5, it was possible for a third party to potentially access
arbitrary files when the application used `SharedDataMiddleware` on
Windows. This issue was
assigned [CVE-2019-14322](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14322).

Due to the way Python's `os.path.join()` function works on Windows, a
path segment with a drive name will change the drive of the final path.
This was [previously addressed](flask-werkzeug-0-12-2-security-release) in the `safe_join()` function in
[Werkzeug 0.12.2](flask-werkzeug-0-12-2-security-release), but `SharedDataMiddleware` used a separate
implementation and so was not secured by the previous fix.

`SharedDataMiddlware` now uses `safe_join()` when fetching requested
files. Projects using `SharedDataMiddleware` on Windows should update
as soon as possible to receive the fix.

Thank you to Emre Övünç and Olivier Dony for responsibly
reporting the issue. If you think you have discovered a security issue
in Werkzeug or another of the Pallets projects, please email
security@palletsprojects.com with details.
