# UPDATE: Potential security vulnerabilities in some of Ricoh's printers and Multifunction Printers (MFPs)

August 23, 2019
**First publish date August 23rd, 2019**
**Date of current status August 26th, 2020**
Ricoh Company, Limited.

Ricoh understands the importance of security and is committed to managing its products and services with the most advanced security technologies possible for their customers around the world.

Following the information disclosed in August, Ricoh has provided new firmware updates to address the identified vulnerabilities.

Please visit [here](/info/2019/0823_1/list).

To minimize potential security risks, Ricoh asks that customers follow the below practices.

1. When the device is connected to a network, make sure that the network is protected, for instance, by a firewall.
2. Install the device in a secure network where users are restricted.
3. To protect the device from fraudulent operation by malicious persons, make sure to set up and periodically change passwords for the administrator and supervisor. Complex passwords more than 8 characters are recommended.
4. Install the device in an environment under appropriate physical security to prevent unauthorized access.

For further details on best practices for securely setting up your printer or MFP, please visit [here](/products/security/mfp/countermeasure/bestpractices).

Ricoh constantly evaluates their products, especially when new vulnerabilities are identified, and will continue to update this list should any models manufactured since January 2014 be affected.
