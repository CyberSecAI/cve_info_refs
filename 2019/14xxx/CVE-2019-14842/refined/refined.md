CVE-2019-14842:
- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper bounds checking in libnbd's structured reply feature. A signed/unsigned confusion caused the check for chunk offsets smaller than the beginning of the request to fail.
- Weakness: The structured reply feature allows the server to send a reply in chunks. A negative offset in one of these chunks can cause data controlled by the server to be written to memory before the read buffer supplied by the client.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - If the read buffer is on the stack: The stack and return address from nbd_pread() can be modified, allowing arbitrary code execution under the control of the server.
  - If the buffer is on the heap: Other memory objects before the buffer can be overwritten, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- Attack vector: A malicious NBD server can send a crafted structured reply with negative offsets.
- Required attacker capabilities: Control of a malicious NBD server.
