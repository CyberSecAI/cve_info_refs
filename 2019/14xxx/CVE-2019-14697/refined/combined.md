Subject: fix x87 stack imbalance in corner cases of i386 math asm
commit 31c5fb80b9eae86f801be4f46025bc6532a554c5 introduced underflow
code paths for the i386 math asm, along with checks on the fpu status
word to skip the underflow-generation instructions if the underflow
flag was already raised. unfortunately, at least one such path, in
log1p, returned with 2 items on the x87 stack rather than just 1 item
for the return value. this is a violation of the ABI's calling
convention, and could cause subsequent floating point code to produce
NANs due to x87 stack overflow. if floating point results are used in
flow control, this can lead to runaway wrong code execution.
rather than reviewing each "underflow already raised" code path for
correctness, remove them all. they're likely slower than just
performing the underflow code unconditionally, and significantly more
complex.
all of this code should be ripped out and replaced by C source files
with inline asm. doing so would preclude this kind of error by having
the compiler perform all x87 stack register allocation and stack
manipulation, and would produce comparable or better code. however
such a change is a much larger project.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

# musl: x87 floating-point stack adjustment imbalance — GLSA **202003-13**

An x87 stack handling error in musl might allow an attacker to have
an application dependent impact.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-libs/musl** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.1.24** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.1.24** |

### Background

musl is an implementation of the C standard library built on top of the
Linux system call API, including interfaces defined in the base language
standard, POSIX, and widely agreed-upon extensions.

### Description

A flaw in musl libc’s arch-specific math assembly code for i386 was
found which can lead to x87 stack overflow in the execution of subsequent
math code.

### Impact

Impact depends on how the application built against musl libc handles
the ABI-violating x87 state.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All musl users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-libs/musl-1.1.24"

```
### References

* [CVE-2019-14697](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-14697)

**Release date**

March 14, 2020

**Latest revision**

March 15, 2020: 2

**Severity**

normal

**Exploitable**

local, remote

The patch contains an error that was missed for unknown reasons,
probably failure to rebuild a file. I'm attaching an aggregate patch
that works. Alternaatively, these two commits can be applied:
