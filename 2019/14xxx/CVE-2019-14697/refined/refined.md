  "description": "x87 floating-point stack adjustment imbalance in musl libc's arch-specific math assembly code for i386. At least the log1p function and possibly others return with more than one item on the x87 stack. This can lead to x87 stack overflow in the execution of subsequent math code, causing it to incorrectly produce a NAN in place of the actual result. If floating point results are used in flow control, this can lead to runaway wrong code execution. Impact depends on how the application built against musl libc handles the ABI-violating x87 state.",

If floating point results are used in flow control, this can lead to runaway wrong code execution.
