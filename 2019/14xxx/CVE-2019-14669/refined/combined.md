# Stored XSS in reports/audit.  #2366

## Description

![@0x2500](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/46705704?v=4&size=48)[0x2500](https://github.com/0x2500)opened [on Aug 2, 2019](https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/issues/2366#issue-476103575)

**Description**

Current version of Firefly III Version 4.7.17.3 is vulnerable to stored XSS due to lack of filtration of user-supplied data in asset account name. Malicious attacker can create specially crafted request, which contains javascript code in it. Malicious javascript code will be executed when user visit link below.

**Steps to reproduce**

1. Add two assets accounts with names "<script>alert("account with no activity");</script>" and "<script>alert("active account");</script>".
2. Do some activity with active account.
3. Visit /reports/audit/[your accounts ids]/20190701/currentMonthEnd

   See 2 alerts. (one in "Account balance of (active account)" and one in "No activity was recorded on (inactive account)").

   I assume that active and inactive account XSS are different issues, due to different endpoints.

   Also, XSS fired on all endpoints /reports/audit/, where asset account name is appeared.
