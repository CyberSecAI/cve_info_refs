Debian Bug     : 886282 885843 875342 872044 872043

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenCV, the Open
Computer Vision Library. Buffer overflows, NULL pointer dereferences and
out-of-bounds write errors may lead to a denial-of-service or other
unspecified impact.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.9.1+dfsg1-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your opencv packages.

For the detailed security status of opencv please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opencv>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
