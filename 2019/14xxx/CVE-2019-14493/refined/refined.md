  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Null-pointer-dereference in function cv::XMLParser::parse at persistence_xml.cpp:795-17.",
    "weakness": "The code does not properly handle null pointers when parsing XML files, leading to a dereference of a null pointer.",
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS) due to program crash.",
    "attackVector": "By providing a crafted XML file as input to OpenCV's `CascadeClassifier::load` or similar functions.",
    "attackerCapabilities": "Attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious XML file to a function that uses the vulnerable XML parsing functionality. The provided steps to reproduce suggest the `classifier` application is used with a malicious XML file (poc3.tar.gz).",
    "affectedVersions": "OpenCV version 4.1.0"
