# CVE-2019-14858

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14857.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14859.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14858 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14858)

#### Description

A vulnerability was found in Ansible engine 2.x up to 2.8 and Ansible tower 3.x up to 3.5. When a module has an argument\_spec with sub parameters marked as no\_log, passing an invalid parameter name to the module will cause the task to fail before the no\_log options in the sub parameters are processed. As a result, data in the sub parameter fields will not be masked and will be displayed if Ansible is run with increased verbosity and present in the module invocation arguments for the task.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-11 12:33:55 UTC  ``` The fix made in Ansible for [CVE-2019-10206](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10206) was not sufficient to resolve the problem.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2019-10-12 07:08:32 UTC  ``` For reference this is <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/63351> upstream.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c3)  Toshio Kuratomi    2019-10-14 15:54:22 UTC  ``` Also note, the backports will be smaller.  The fix in devel makes two changes which are independently sufficient to fix the problem.  The backport will only include one of them.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c4)  Hardik Vyas    2019-10-21 13:38:17 UTC  ``` Vulnerable code from [CVE-2019-10206](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10206) was included in the version of Ansible shipped with Ceph and Gluster.  Gluster uses Ansible package from Ansible repository and hence it will consume fixes from core Ansible. For Ceph-3 we still maintain Ansible atleast for Ubuntu, Ceph-2 is about to reach end of life in December 2019.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:01:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.7 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:3202 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3202](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3202)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:01:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:3201 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3201](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3201)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:06:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:3203 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3203](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3203)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 14:27:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:3207 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3207](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3207)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-10-25 00:51:24 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Description:
This update for ansible to version 2.9.6 fixes the following issues:
Security issues fixed:

in nxos\_file\_copy module (boo#1157969).
- CVE-2019-14864: Fixed Splunk and Sumologic callback plugins leak
sensitive data in logs (boo#1154830).
- CVE-2019-14846: Fixed secrets disclosure on logs due to display is
hardcoded to DEBUG level (boo#1153452)
- CVE-2019-14856: Fixed insufficient fix for CVE-2019-10206 (boo#1154232)

masked and will be displayed when run with increased verbosity
(boo#1154231)
- CVE-2019-10206: ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools prompt
passwords by expanding them from templates as they could contain special
characters. Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and
exposing them. (boo#1142690)

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-10216.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-10218.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-10217 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10217)

#### Description

A flaw was found in ansible 2.8.0 before 2.8.4. Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by no\_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. service\_account\_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not setting no\_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-11 12:33:55 UTC  ``` The fix made in Ansible for [CVE-2019-10206](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10206) was not sufficient to resolve the problem.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c2)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2019-10-12 07:08:32 UTC  ``` For reference this is <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/63351> upstream.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c3)  Toshio Kuratomi    2019-10-14 15:54:22 UTC  ``` Also note, the backports will be smaller.  The fix in devel makes two changes which are independently sufficient to fix the problem.

Gluster uses Ansible package from Ansible repository and hence it will consume fixes from core Ansible. For Ceph-3 we still maintain Ansible atleast for Ubuntu, Ceph-2 is about to reach end of life in December 2019.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:01:10 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.7 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:3202 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3202](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3202)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:01:27 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.6 for RHEL 7  Via RHSA-2019:3201 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3201](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3201)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 13:06:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2.8 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:3203 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3203](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3203)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c9)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-24 14:27:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 7   Red Hat Ansible Engine 2 for RHEL 8  Via RHSA-2019:3207 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3207](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3207)   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1760829#c10)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-10-25 00:51:24 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# CVE-2019-14904

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14902.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14905.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14904 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14904)

#### Description

A flaw was found in the solaris\_zone module from the Ansible Community modules. When setting the name for the zone on the Solaris host, the zone name is checked by listing the process with the 'ps' bare command on the remote machine. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw by crafting the name of the zone and executing arbitrary commands in the remote host. Ansible Engine 2.7.15, 2.8.7, and 2.9.2 as well as previous versions are affected.

Description:
This update for ansible to version 2.9.6 fixes the following issues:
Security issues fixed:

in nxos\_file\_copy module (boo#1157969).
- CVE-2019-14864: Fixed Splunk and Sumologic callback plugins leak
sensitive data in logs (boo#1154830).
- CVE-2019-14846: Fixed secrets disclosure on logs due to display is
hardcoded to DEBUG level (boo#1153452)
- CVE-2019-14856: Fixed insufficient fix for CVE-2019-10206 (boo#1154232)

masked and will be displayed when run with increased verbosity
(boo#1154231)
- CVE-2019-10206: ansible-playbook -k and ansible cli tools prompt
passwords by expanding them from templates as they could contain special
characters. Passwords should be wrapped to prevent templates trigger and
exposing them. (boo#1142690)

# CVE-2019-14846

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14844.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14847.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14846 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14846)

#### Description

In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.
