Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14806:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Werkzeug debugger generates a unique PIN per host to prevent unauthorized code execution. However, in Docker environments, the machine ID used to generate this PIN was identical across all containers. This resulted in the same debugger PIN being generated for all containers, thus allowing access to one container's debugger from another.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Randomness:** The primary vulnerability lies in the insufficient randomness of the debugger PIN generation within Docker containers due to the shared machine ID.
- **Predictable PIN:** The debugger PIN, intended to be unique, becomes predictable when containers share the same underlying machine ID

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Code Execution:** An attacker gaining access to the debugger could execute arbitrary code within the container.
- **Information Disclosure:** Although not directly stated, gaining access to the debugger can also lead to information disclosure by inspecting variables and runtime state.
- **Compromise of Container:** A successful exploit could lead to the full compromise of the targeted container.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network access to the debugger:** The Werkzeug debugger is typically exposed through a web interface, potentially accessible from other containers or from the outside.
- **Access within the same Docker host:** An attacker having access to one container within a Docker host can use the predictable PIN to gain access to the debugger of another container on the same host.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network connectivity:** An attacker needs network access to the container running the vulnerable Werkzeug application, either from within the same host or from outside.
- **Knowledge of the predictable PIN**: Since all containers shared the same PIN, knowing the pin from one container allows access to others.
- **Ability to interact with the debugger interface**: The attacker has to be able to send the correct commands to the exposed web interface.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The fix involves making the debugger pin unique per container by using the container ID as part of the generation process.
-   The vulnerability is considered of moderate severity by SUSE.
-   The `get_machine_id` function was modified to consider `/proc/self/cgroup` to generate a unique ID within a container, as docker containers share the same machine id.
-   The Werkzeug debugger is intended for development use and should not be exposed in production environments
