Exploit Title: CWP (CentOS Control Web Panel) Delete other sub-domain
Date: 24 Jul 2019
Exploit Author: Pongtorn Angsuchotmetee, Nissana Sirijirakal, Narin Boonwasanarak
Vendor Homepage: https://control-webpanel.com/
Software Link: Not available, user panel only available for lastest version
Version: 0.9.8.851
Tested on: CentOS 7.6.1810 (Core) FireFox 68.0.1 (64-bit)
CVE-Number: CVE-2019-14729

Vulnerability:
- Root cause: The vulnerability exists because the web panel does not properly validate the 'domain' and 'subdomain' parameters when deleting a subdomain.
- Weaknesses: Lack of proper input validation.
- Attack vectors: By intercepting the request to delete a subdomain, a malicious user can modify the "domain" and "subdomain" parameters in the POST request.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:  The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with access to the "Domains >> Sub Domains" section in the web panel.
- Impact of exploitation: An authenticated user can delete arbitrary subdomains of other users by manipulating the parameters of a request, potentially leading to data loss or service disruption.
