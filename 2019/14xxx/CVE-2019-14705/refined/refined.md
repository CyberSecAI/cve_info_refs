  "cve_id": "CVE-2019-14705",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists within the handling of file uploads in the `upload.php` script due to insufficient bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (DoS). The overflow occurs when a file with a filename longer than 256 bytes is uploaded. The oversized filename prevents proper cleanup of the uploaded file, which leads to storage exhaustion and can cause a DoS.",
    "attack_vectors": "An unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted HTTP request to the `upload.php` script, including a file with a filename exceeding 256 bytes.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not require authentication and can send HTTP requests to the affected web server."
