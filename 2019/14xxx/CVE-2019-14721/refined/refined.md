### CVE-2019-14721
The provided content describes a vulnerability in CentOS Control Web Panel (CWP) version 0.9.8.851 that allows a normal user to remove database users from phpMyAdmin, even those not belonging to their account.

**Root Cause:** The application lacks proper authorization checks when deleting database users through the "MySQL Manager" in the user panel.

**Weakness:** Insufficient authorization, allows privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  Log in to CWP as a normal user.
2.  Navigate to the "MySQL Manager" section.
3.  Attempt to delete a database user.
4.  Intercept the HTTP request sent to the server.
5.  Modify the "user" parameter in the request to specify a different database username (e.g., a user listed in `/etc/passwd`, which are automatically added as database users).
6.  Forward the modified request to the server.

**Impact:** An attacker can remove arbitrary database users, potentially disrupting services or gaining unauthorized access to databases.

**Required Capabilities:**
*   Attacker needs a valid user account with access to the CWP user panel.
*   Ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests (e.g., using a web proxy).
