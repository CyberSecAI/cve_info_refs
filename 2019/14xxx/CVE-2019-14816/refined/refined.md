Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-14816:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2019-14816 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability present in the `mwifiex_update_vs_ie()` function within the Marvell WiFi driver of the Linux kernel. The function doesn't properly validate the size of the data being copied, specifically when parsing vendor-specific informational attributes. This lack of bounds checking allows for an overflow when data from user space is copied into a fixed-size buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of bounds checking when using `memcpy()`, allowing data of arbitrary length to be written into a fixed-size heap buffer (`ie->ie_buffer` which is of size `IEEE_MAX_IE_SIZE(256)`).
*   **Insufficient validation of user-supplied data:**  The size of the source data for the memcpy operation (`vs_ie->len`) comes from the WLAN IE which is extracted from a user-supplied "beacon". This data is not validated, resulting in the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to a system crash due to memory corruption, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker may be able to exploit the vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution, enabling them to gain further control over the system.
*  **Local Privilege Escalation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by local users with permission to configure a network device which uses the vulnerable driver.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Attack:** A local user or process with access to a wifi device using the vulnerable driver and the ability to craft network traffic could trigger the overflow.
*   **Adjacent Network:** For the specific case of a malicious Wireless Access Point or a malicious adhoc/P2P peer, they could exploit the vulnerability remotely to affect systems in the same network that use the vulnerable driver, as they control the beacon that is used during association.
*  **Remote Exploitation**: The bug can be triggered remotely by crafted wireless traffic via USBIP or USBRR.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local attacker:** The attacker needs to have the ability to configure a wifi interface using the affected Marvell driver.
*   **Physical Proximity** In scenarios where a wireless access point or P2P peer initiates the attack, they will need to be within wireless radio range.
*   **Ability to craft packets:** The attacker will need the ability to craft wifi traffic that contains malicious/long vendor-specific IEs, specifically within the beacon, probe response, or association response IEs.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability resides in the `mwifiex` driver of the Linux kernel.
* The vulnerability is a heap overflow, where a buffer allocated on the heap is overwritten due to insufficient bounds checking on the length of user-provided input before it is copied to a fixed-size memory region.
*   Red Hat notes that their "Enterprise Linux" (RHEL) kernels do not ship with this network device enabled by default, reducing the likelihood of exploitation.
*   The fix involves putting the length check before performing `memcpy()`.
* Red Hat also notes that the flaw can be triggered by getting the system to join a wireless network that has an ESSID longer than the maximum expected length of 32 characters, and also by crafted USB devices.
