Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-14888:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content explicitly mentions `CVE-2019-14888` and describes it as:

*   "undertow: possible Denial Of Service (DOS) in Undertow HTTP server listening on HTTPS"
*   "undertow: possible Denial Of Service (DOS) in Undertow HTTP server listening on HTTPS (CVE-2019-14888)"

This aligns with the official description of CVE-2019-14888, which involves a denial of service vulnerability in the Undertow HTTP server when listening on HTTPS.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the Undertow HTTP server's handling of HTTPS connections. Specifically, versions prior to 2.0.28.SP1 are vulnerable. The specifics of the vulnerability are not detailed in the provided text, but it is related to how the server handles the SSL/TLS handshake or connection processing on the HTTPS port.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary weakness is a vulnerability within the Undertow HTTP server that can be exploited when the server is listening on HTTPS. The content suggests a flaw in how Undertow handles HTTPS connections leading to a DOS scenario. The specific vulnerable component within Undertow seems to be related to the `SSLEngine` implementation.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service, making the service unavailable on SSL. This implies that the service or application relying on the vulnerable Undertow server would become unreachable or unusable for legitimate users.
*   **Service Unavailability on SSL:** The DOS attack specifically targets the HTTPS port, resulting in the service being unavailable over SSL/TLS.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker targets the HTTPS port of the vulnerable Undertow server.
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the target HTTPS port of the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require any prior authentication or special privileges.

**7. Additional Details**

*   **Mitigation:** Enabling HTTP2 (enable-http2="true") in the undertow's HTTPS settings is mentioned as a mitigation strategy.
*   **Affected Products**: Multiple Red Hat and NetApp products are affected by this vulnerability.  Red Hat mentions specifically "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform" and "Red Hat Data Grid"  NetApp lists several of their Active IQ Unified Manager products.
*   **Fixed In Version:** The issue is fixed in Undertow version 2.0.28.SP1.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Root Cause**: A vulnerability in how Undertow HTTP server handles HTTPS connections.
*   **Vulnerabilities**:  Vulnerability in Undertow HTTP server's `SSLEngine` implementation, leading to a DOS.
*  **Impact**: Denial-of-Service making services unavailable on SSL/TLS.
*  **Attack Vectors**: Network-based, targeting the HTTPS port.
*  **Attacker Requirements**: Network access, no authentication required.
*  **Mitigation**: Enabling HTTP2 in Undertow's HTTPS settings.
