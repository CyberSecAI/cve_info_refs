The provided content is related to CVE-2019-14731.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Rich Text Box feature of the zentaopms application. Specifically, the application fails to adequately filter or escape HTML content within the image insertion process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The vulnerability is "stored" because the malicious script is saved to the server and executed when other users view the affected content.
- Lack of input sanitization/validation in Rich Text Box.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers.
- The attacker can steal sensitive information like cookies, which can be used to hijack user sessions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to add a picture through the Rich Text Box.
- The attacker must intercept the request to the server when adding the image.
- The attacker needs to modify the image data to include an onerror event containing malicious JavaScript: `<img src="a" onerror="alert(document.cookie)" />`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to use the Rich Text Box feature.
- The attacker needs to intercept the network request to modify the image data.
