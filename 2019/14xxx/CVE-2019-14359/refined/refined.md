{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The SSD1309 OLED controller, used in the BC Vault device, displays one pixel row at a time and has a power consumption that directly correlates to the number of illuminated pixels on each row.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Side-channel vulnerability due to power consumption variations during screen display.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially recover information about what is being displayed on the screen through statistical analysis of power consumption measurements. In the case of BC Vault, the only information obtainable is the length of the PIN.",
  "Attack vectors": "Physical access to the device's USB cable or port is required. A shunt resistor must be installed to measure the voltage.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs physical access to the device and requires specialized equipment to measure voltage fluctuations (e.g., oscilloscope or software-defined radio). The attacker also needs the victim to enter their credentials while the measuring equipment is connected."
