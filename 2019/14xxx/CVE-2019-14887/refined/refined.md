  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The 'enabled-protocols' value in Wildfly's legacy security configuration is not respected when using the OpenSSL security provider.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The OpenSSL security provider in Wildfly does not enforce the specified TLS versions in the 'enabled-protocols' configuration."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially downgrade a TLS connection to a weaker version, breaking the encryption and potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive data or addition/modification of data.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks targeting traffic sent over a TLS connection."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to intercept and manipulate traffic sent to a vulnerable Wildfly instance using OpenSSL provider."
  },
  "CVE": "CVE-2019-14887",
  "extra_details": "The provided information also includes a list of NetApp products that are NOT affected by this vulnerability, which is helpful to narrow down the potential impact. Mitigation guidance is also provided, suggesting users avoid using the OpenSSL security provider and use the default or regular JSSE provider with 'TLS'."
