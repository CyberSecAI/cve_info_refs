Gotta say, use common sense and go through the admin menus well, set up your active times, and primary owner, and the group.
Everything works well. Impressive little chat.

I am looking for a simple chat. There is a very complicated configuration here. The system asks about some strange settings. This cannot be configured. Lack of Polish, despite the fact that the developer reports that Polish is supported. Waste of time.

### [Privacy major issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/privacy-major-issue/)

[thomasmathys](https://profiles.wordpress.org/thomasmathys/ "Posts by thomasmathys")
March 10, 2022

Even when opting for standalone storage (on your own WP server), this plugin communicates with 3CX servers by WebSockets for real-time operations. And all your confidential data are passed through this channel and come to C3X servers without encryption: visitor informations such as name or email address, and every message you or your visitor can send. The “enable encryption” option within the WP plugin has no effect on it.
The data are encrypted in transit (WSS protocol) but can be read on 3CX servers. We find the mention Chat message content is not logged on the “external party services” chapter, but it is very unclear that these external services are used even if you choose the standalone setup.
It means for me a major privacy issue, a poor GDPR compliance and, overall, a severe lack of trustability for a solution presented as standalone.
