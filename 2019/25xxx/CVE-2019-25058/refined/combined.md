# Polkit policy is not valid with newest versions of Polkit #403

## Description

![@LucasParsy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24274639?u=b5e22ac25ded8de3a2bd89ed0918b61b8ba6bfbd&v=4&size=48)[LucasParsy](https://github.com/LucasParsy)opened [on Aug 7, 2020](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/issues/403#issue-675176585)

With new versions of Polkit, the value `auth_self_keep_session` is no more valid for the tags `<allow_any>`, `<allow_inactive>` and `<allow_active>`.

The [usbguard policy config](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/blob/master/src/DBus/org.usbguard1.policy) is not parsed anymore by new versions of Polkit, and the defined actions are unavailable.

#### proposed solutions

* `auth_self_keep_session`: allowed executing an action after authenticating, and the redo the action without auth for all the rest of the session.

  It is now unavailable
* `auth_self_keep`: the authorization is kept for a brief period (e.g. five minutes).

  It is most probably not retro-compatible. (I found no reference online of `auth_self_keep` on pages mentioning `auth_self_keep_session`)
* `auth_self`: You have to re-authenticate at each call of the action.

  This argument is retro-compatible.

Should we replace occurrences of `auth_self_keep_session` with `auth_self_keep` or `auth_self`?

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Package        : usbguard
Version        : 0.6.2+ds1-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-25058
Debian Bug     : 1008026

A flaw was found in usbguard, an USB device authorization policy framework.
When using the usbguard-dbus daemon an unprivileged user could make USBGuard
allow all USB devices to be connected in the future.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
0.6.2+ds1-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your usbguard packages.

For the detailed security status of usbguard please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/usbguard>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Fixes [#273](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/issues/273)

Fixes [#403](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/issues/403)

* Fix `.policy` file:
  + Replace unsupported value `auth_self_keep_session` by `auth_self_keep` to fix the Polkit parse error so that Polkit stops ignoring the USBGuard `.policy` file.
  + Drop actions/methods from the policy that no longer exist.
  + Add actions/methods to the policy file that have been missing.
* Make `usbguard-dbus` call out to Polkit for authorization so that the policies from the `.policy` file are actually respected.
* Add CI to protect against policy file parse error regressions.

# No default ACL on some dbus methods #273

## Description

![@tweksteen](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/109376?v=4&size=48)[tweksteen](https://github.com/tweksteen)opened [on Feb 7, 2019](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/issues/273#issue-407669808)

Some of the methods exposed via dbus are not covered by the [current default policy](https://github.com/USBGuard/usbguard/blob/master/src/DBus/org.usbguard.policy). This includes the `getParameter` and `setParameter` methods.

On a default debian install, as unprivileged user:

```
$ usbguard get-parameter InsertedDevicePolicy
ERROR: IPC connect: service=usbguard: Operation not permitted
$ dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.usbguard /org/usbguard/Policy org.usbguard.getParameter string:"InsertedDevicePolicy"
method return time=1549540531.655300 sender=:1.79383 -> destination=:1.120734 serial=97 reply_serial=2
   string "apply-policy"

```

This can be fixed by adding these to the current policy configuration. However, having 2 buses and 2 ACLs makes the administration of any deployment tedious. There is always a risk of future methods to be exposed. Ideally, dbus should be the only bus exposed and the libqb bus dropped.
