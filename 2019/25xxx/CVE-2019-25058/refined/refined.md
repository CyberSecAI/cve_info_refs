{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing access control on some D-Bus methods in the usbguard-dbus daemon, which allows unprivileged users to bypass intended restrictions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Missing authorization checks",
      "Use of unsupported policy values"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user can bypass the intended policy enforcement and allow all USB devices to be connected, thereby gaining unauthorized access to the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "D-Bus interface",
       "Specifically the methods exposed via dbus which were not properly covered by the default policy"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local access to the system and the ability to communicate with the D-Bus interface."
  },
  "affected_component": "usbguard",
    "patches": [
        "Replace unsupported value `auth_self_keep_session` with `auth_self_keep` in the Polkit policy file.",
        "Drop actions/methods from the policy file that no longer exist.",
        "Add missing actions/methods to the policy file.",
        "Implement proper authorization checks using Polkit in `usbguard-dbus`."
