***Tip:** You can search by CVE ID, software name or slug, or the researcher name. Expand to read about more advanced search options.*

If you want to perform more advanced lookups, you can use **keywords** to further refine your search.

For example, `woocommerce researcher:"chloe chamberland"` would search for any vulnerabilities discovered by Chloe Chamberland in software that has WooCommerce in the title.

Keywords are added in `keyword:value` format. If the value contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotation marks.

You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

By selecting “Search” you acknowledge that you have read and agree to the Wordfence Intelligence Terms and Conditions.

### Description

The WP HTML Mail plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML injection in versions up to, and including, 2.2.10 due to insufficient input sanitization. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Multiple plugins offering to convert WordPress’ default plain text emails to HTML format were found to be vulnerable to HTML injection, which could lead to phishing or CSRF attacks targeting the administrator.

### Reference

*A CVE ID has been requested and we’ll update this post when it is assigned.*

### Vulnerable plugins

* [Email Templates](https://wordpress.org/plugins/email-templates/) <=1.3 (20,000+ active installations)
* [WP HTML Mail – Email Designer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-html-mail/) <=2.9.0.3 (10,000+ active installations)
* [WP Email Template](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-email-template/https%3A//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-email-template/) <=2.2.10 (5,000+ active installations)

### HTML Injection

Those plugins convert the default plain text emails sent by WordPress to HTML format. However, they take the content of the “text/plain” part and turn it into a new “text/html” part without sanitising it. That can lead to HTML injection and can be used for phishing and CSRF attacks targeting the administrators because it affects all messages sent by the blog, its plugins and themes (e.g., contact form, comment, notification etc).

Here’s an example of a malicious message posted using the WordPress default comment form:

![](../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wordpress-html-injection-vulnerability-in-email.png)

Because WordPress sends plain text emails, it doesn’t need to sanitise the body, and thus the administrator will receive the following message:

![](../wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wordpress-html-injection-vulnerability-in-email-3.png)

Obviously, the attempt to trick the admin into clicking on the malicious link is so plain to see that the attacker doesn’t stand a chance.

But it’s a whole different story when the same message is sent, unsanitised, using one of the above plugins:

### Timeline

The vulnerabilities were discovered and reported to the wordpress.org team on October 16, 2019.

### Recommendations

Update any of the above plugins to the latest available version.
