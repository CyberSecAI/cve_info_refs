Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way TurboGears handles redirects. The application was not sanitizing redirect URLs, making it possible to inject arbitrary headers by including newline characters (`\r` or `\n`) within the redirect path. Since HTTP is a text-based protocol, these newline characters would allow an attacker to insert their own headers, leading to a header injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Header Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of redirect URLs before incorporating them into the `Location` header. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTTP headers by including newline characters in the redirect URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers. This could lead to various exploits, including:
    - **Session fixation:** Setting a specific session cookie for the user.
    - **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** If an attacker can inject javascript through a crafted header, this could be a potential risk if the user's browser does not sanitize headers before interpreting them.
    - **Cache poisoning:** Manipulating cache control directives.
    - **Other attacks**: Any attack that can be carried out by injecting arbitrary HTTP headers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulating the redirect URL. This could be achieved via URL parameters or any other input that is used to construct a redirect path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the redirect URL by influencing URL parameters or any input that is used to construct a redirect path.
- The attacker must be able to send requests to the server with the crafted URLs.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix implemented is to raise an `InvalidRedirectException` if the redirect URL includes a carriage return (`\r`) or newline (`\n`) character.
- The fix includes a test case for the vulnerability which makes sure that the new exception is raised if a malicious redirect URL is used.
- The identified issue was labeled as "SWAT-20".
