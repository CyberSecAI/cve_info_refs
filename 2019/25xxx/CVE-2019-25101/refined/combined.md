SWAT-20: Remove header injection vulnerability on redirect

[Browse files](/OnShift/turbogears/tree/f68bbaba47f4474e1da553aa51564a73e1d92a84)
Browse the repository at this point in the history

```
There was a Header Injection issue (remember HTTP is a text protocol and new
lines matter).  Basically you could inject a header or even the text with
certain parameters.  Typically, this failed on redirects because of the location
header.  We now throw an exception if the redirect url includes a new line or
carriage return.  Neither of these are valid (though you can presumably escape
them).
```

### @timmartin19 **[timmartin19](/timmartin19)** commented [Jan 29, 2019](#issue-404091164)

There was a Header Injection issue (remember HTTP is a text protocol and new

lines matter). Basically you could inject a header or even the text with

certain parameters. Typically, this failed on redirects because of the location

header. We now throw an exception if the redirect url includes a new line or

carriage return. Neither of these are valid (though you can presumably escape

them).

Sorry, something went wrong.

I don't understand why that large chunk is reporting as changed. Other than that, it looks good.
