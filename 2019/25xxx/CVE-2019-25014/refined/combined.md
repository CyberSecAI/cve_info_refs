| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1919066#c0)  Mark Cooper    2021-01-22 03:01:33 UTC  ``` Istio pilot before v1.5.0-alpha.0 is susceptible to an array out of range panic. If a crafted HTTP GET request is made to the pilot debug API endpoint, it is possible to cause the Go runtime to panic resulting in a denial of service to the istio-pilot application.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1919066#c1)  Mark Cooper    2021-01-22 03:05:06 UTC  ``` Upstream fix: <https://github.com/istio/istio/commit/d96a9b6ce1ffc3deef46ffd3d356368be228f96a>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1919066#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-04-22 09:01:29 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    OpenShift Service Mesh 1.1  Via RHSA-2021:1322 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:1322](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A1322)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1919066#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-04-22 10:46:38 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
