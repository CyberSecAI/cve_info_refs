Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-25138:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper file type validation in the `usp_check_images` function within the User Submitted Posts plugin. The plugin relies on `exif_imagetype()` and `getimagesize()` to validate image uploads, but these functions are insufficient for validating untrusted user input as they can be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to upload files without proper validation of file types.
*   **Insufficient File Type Validation:** The `exif_imagetype()` function only checks the first three bytes of the file, and `getimagesize()` can be bypassed by crafting a file with a valid header and malicious code after the header.
*   **Bypassable Extension Check:** The fix implemented only checked for a `.php` extension, which could be bypassed by using double extensions such as `.php.gif`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Attackers can upload any file type, including malicious PHP scripts, to the server.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and executing malicious PHP files, attackers can gain control of the affected website's server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated User:** An unauthenticated user can submit a malicious file through the plugin's image upload feature.
*   **Front-end Form:** The attack is performed via the front-end form provided by the plugin for user submissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not need any prior access or valid credentials to the website to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker only requires network access to the website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in versions up to and including 20190312 of the User Submitted Posts plugin.
*   A patch was released in version 20190426, which adds a check for `.php` extensions, but is still vulnerable to double extension bypass.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical).
