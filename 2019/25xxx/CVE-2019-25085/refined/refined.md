Based on the provided information, this commit fixes a use-after-free vulnerability in `gvdb_table_write_contents_async()`.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The variable `str` was being freed prematurely before being used in `g_file_replace_contents_async()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free. The code attempts to access memory that has already been deallocated. This leads to the file saved being always empty.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially arbitrary code execution. In this specific case, it also results in an empty file being saved.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could trigger the `gvdb_table_write_contents_async()` function with crafted input that leads to the premature freeing of `str`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the input to the `gvdb_table_write_contents_async()` function.

The fix replaces the usage of `str` with `bytes` which is created using `g_bytes_new_take`. This ensures that data passed to `g_file_replace_contents_async` is valid and available.
