***Tip:** You can search by CVE ID, software name or slug, or the researcher name. Expand to read about more advanced search options.*

If you want to perform more advanced lookups, you can use **keywords** to further refine your search.

For example, `woocommerce researcher:"chloe chamberland"` would search for any vulnerabilities discovered by Chloe Chamberland in software that has WooCommerce in the title.

Keywords are added in `keyword:value` format. If the value contains spaces, you must enclose it in quotation marks.

You can use the following keywords to add criteria to your search:

title
Searches through the title of each vulnerability for matches.

date
Returns vulnerabilities by publication date. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, `YYYY-MM` or `YYYY` format.

cvss-rating
Use `low`, `medium`, `high` or `critical` to limit the search to vulnerabilities with the specified rating.

researcher
Returns vulnerabilities credited to researchers containing the given text.

software
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software containing the given text.

software-slug
Returns vulnerabilities discovered in software exactly matching the given slug.

software-type
Use `plugin`, `theme` or `core` to limit the search to the specified type of software.

### Description

The Contact Form & SMTP Plugin by PirateForms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to HTML injection in the ‘public/class-pirateforms-public.php’ file in versions up to, and including, 2.5.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary HTML in emails that could be used to phish unsuspecting victims.

# HTML injection vulnerability in WordPress Pirate Forms plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [July 27, 2019 - 4:06am [+0700]July 27, 2019 - 4:11am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/html-injection-vulnerability-in-wordpress-pirate-forms-plugin/)

The WordPress [Pirate Forms plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pirate-forms/), which has 200,000+ active installations, was prone to an HTML injection vulnerability affecting all email messages sent from its contact form.

A few years ago, we revealed details of an [ongoing spear phishing attack](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-vulnerability-in-swiftsecurity-hide-wordpress-firewall-leads-to-phishing-attack/) that was made possible because of a vulnerability in a security plugin that was installed to protect the WordPress blog of the victim. Pirate Forms v2.5.1 and below was affected by the same type of vulnerability.

### Unauthenticated HTML injection

The vulnerable code is located in the ‘public/class-pirateforms-public.php’ script. Lines 592 to 600, if the `pirateformsopt_store_ip` option is enabled, the plugin retrieves the IP from `REMOTE_ADDR` and validates it with the PHP `filter_var()` function, but if there’s an `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` variable defined, it will override the IP with that unsafe one, without any validation:

```

   $contact_ip     = null;
   if ( isset( $pirate_forms_options['pirateformsopt_store_ip'] ) && 'yes' === $pirate_forms_options['pirateformsopt_store_ip'] ) {
      $contact_ip = filter_var( $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'], FILTER_VALIDATE_IP );
      /* for the case of a Web server behind a reverse proxy */
      if ( array_key_exists( 'HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR', $_SERVER ) ) {
         $contact_ip_tmp = explode( ',', $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR'] );
         if ( ! empty( $contact_ip_tmp ) ) {
            $contact_ip = array_pop( $contact_ip_tmp );
         }
      }

      // If valid and present, create a link to an IP search
      $body['body'][ __( 'IP address', 'pirate-forms' ) ] = $contact_ip;
      $body['body'][ __( 'IP search', 'pirate-forms' ) ]  = "http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip/$contact_ip";
      $body['magic_tags'] += array( 'ip' => $contact_ip );

```

Because Pirate Forms forwards all email messages sent from the contact form to the admin mailbox using HTML format by default, any HTML code can be inserted into the template. For instance, an unauthenticated attacker can inject into the email body a link pointing to a malicious login page URL in an attempt to steal the administrator credentials:

A CSRF attack could also be used against an authenticated administrator in order to trick the victim into performing an undesired action on their own website (that’s why, if you’re a WordPress plugin or theme developer, you should use [security nonces](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Nonces) to block this type of attack).

### Timeline

The vulnerability was discovered and reported to the wordpress.org team on July 26, 2019.
