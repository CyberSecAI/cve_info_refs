{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Tendermint client did not disable Gzip compression for HTTP responses, making it vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption",
      "Lack of limiting response body sizes"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious server can send a Gzip-compressed response that expands to a much larger size when decompressed by the client, causing excessive resource consumption and potentially leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attack through a malicious server."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to control the server that the Tendermint client connects to.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability is caused by the Go HTTP client's default behavior of supporting Gzip compression and automatically decompressing responses, combined with the lack of a size limit on response bodies in Tendermint client. A patch was made by setting `DisableCompression` to true in the HTTP client's transport configuration."
