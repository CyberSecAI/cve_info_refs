{
  "CVE-2019-25025": {
    "related_to_description": true,
    "description": "The `activerecord-session_store` (aka Active Record Session Store) component through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering information about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short amount of time. This is a related issue to [CVE-2019-16782](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hrqr-hxpp-chr3 \"CVE-2019-16782\").",
    "root_cause": "The `activerecord-session_store` component does not use a constant-time approach when checking session ID validity.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Timing attack vulnerability due to non-constant time comparison of session IDs."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote attackers can leverage timing discrepancies to guess valid session IDs, potentially leading to unauthorized access to user sessions.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote network attacks.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP requests to the server and measure the response times."
