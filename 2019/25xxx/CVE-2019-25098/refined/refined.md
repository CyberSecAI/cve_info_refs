The provided content relates to CVE-2019-25098.

Based on the commit message and the diffs, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities addressed:

**Root Cause:**

*   The primary root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in various parts of the `extplorer` application. This allows for several types of attacks: XSS, arbitrary file read, and path traversal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**
    *   The code uses `htmlspecialchars()` on user-provided data before displaying it to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   The code was not using `htmlspecialchars` in multiple places, allowing XSS attacks
    *   Specifically, in `include/archive.php`, `include/chmod.php`, `include/result.class.php` and `include/search.php`
2.  **Arbitrary File Read:**
    *   The code didn't properly validate user inputs in file operations, potentially allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server.
    *   The commit message explicitly mentions "Arbitrary file read".
3.  **Path Traversal in Directory Listing:**
    *   The application was vulnerable to path traversal when listing directory contents.
    *   The `down_home()` function, intended to prevent access outside the home directory, had a logic error, allowing traversal.
    *   The `down_home()` function's logic was flawed. It checked if the realpath of a provided directory was a substring of the realpath of the home directory.
    *  Additionally, a check for `..` was done with a case-insensitive function `stristr()` which allows for bypass. 
4.  **Path Traversal in Archive Feature:**
    *   The archive feature was also vulnerable to path traversal, likely due to inadequate input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities within the user's browser.
*   **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the server, including configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
*   **Path Traversal:** An attacker could potentially bypass access restrictions and manipulate files outside of the intended directory. For example, reading and potentially overwriting sensitive files.
*   **Archive Traversal:** An attacker could create archives that contain files outside the intended directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Exploitation likely involves crafting malicious HTTP requests with manipulated parameters (e.g., file paths, filenames).
*   **User Input:** These vulnerabilities exploit the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data provided via the web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the web interface of `extplorer`.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the application's structure and the vulnerable parameters to craft malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**

* The patch addresses the vulnerabilities by:
    *   Applying `htmlspecialchars()` to user input in several places to prevent XSS.
    *   Using `basename()` in archive creation, to limit the path to the file name.
    *  Fixing the `down_home()` function to perform a stricter comparison to prevent path traversal.
    * Changing the check for `..` to a case-sensitive function `strpos()`.
    *  Applying `htmlentities()` to user input in various places to prevent path traversal via encodings.

In summary, the commit addresses multiple security vulnerabilities in `extplorer` by implementing better input validation, encoding and sanitization, especially regarding file and path manipulation.
