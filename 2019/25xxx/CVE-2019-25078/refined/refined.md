{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `pacparser_find_proxy` function incorrectly calculates the required buffer size for a script, leading to a potential memory overwrite.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect memory allocation size based on the original URL length instead of the potentially larger sanitized URL length.",
      "Use of `strcat` without sufficient buffer size checks."
    ],
    "impact": "Memory overwrite vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a URL with single quote characters, which are then replaced by '%27', resulting in an increased length of the sanitized URL, causing a buffer overflow when concatenated into the script variable.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to influence the URL parameter of the `pacparser_find_proxy` function with a URL that contains single quote characters."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided information gives a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability than the standard CVE description placeholder. Specifically, it pinpoints the vulnerable code section and how the issue arises from using strlen(url) instead of strlen(sanitized_url)."
