{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The rcp client in MIT krb5-appl does not properly validate the object name returned by the server, only preventing directory traversal attacks. This is due to the rcp implementation being derived from the 1983 rcp.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient validation of object names received from the server."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious rcp server (or Man-in-The-Middle attacker) can overwrite arbitrary files in the rcp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well, potentially overwriting critical files like .ssh/authorized_keys.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "A malicious rcp server",
         "Man-in-The-Middle attacker"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the rcp server or be positioned as a Man-in-The-Middle to intercept and modify communications."
