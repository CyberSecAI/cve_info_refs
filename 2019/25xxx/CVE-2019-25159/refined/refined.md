The provided content relates to CVE-2019-25159.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection vulnerability in the `config/cargos.php` file. The code directly uses the value of the `dni_profe` parameter from the `$_GET` array in a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the `dni_profe` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into the `dni_profe` GET parameter.
- This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the database's configuration and the application's permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The vulnerability can be exploited via a specially crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious payload in the `dni_profe` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the vulnerable parameters.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `config/cargos.php` where the `$_GET['dni_profe']` is directly included in a SQL `delete` query:
  ```php
  mysqli_query($db_con, "delete from departamentos where dni = '".$_GET['dni_profe']."'");
  ```
- The commit `678190bee1dfd64b54a2b0e88abfd009e78adce8` attempts to remediate the SQL injection vulnerability, by adding a sanitization step using `preg_replace` to remove non-alphanumeric characters:
  ```php
  $dni_profe = preg_replace('([^A-Za-z0-9])', '', $_GET['dni_profe']);
  mysqli_query($db_con, "delete from departamentos where dni = '".$dni_profe."'");
  ```
  However, this might not be sufficient depending on the database configuration and it still leaves room for SQL injection via the `dni` column.
