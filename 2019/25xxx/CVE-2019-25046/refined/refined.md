The provided content relates to CVE-2019-25046. It describes an XSS vulnerability when previewing SVG content in Cerberus FTP Server's Web Client.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Execution of arbitrary scripts embedded within SVG files when previewed in the web client.
- **Weakness/vulnerability**: XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Malicious scripts may hijack the user's session and perform actions on their behalf.
- **Attack vector**: Uploading a malicious SVG file to the server and having a user preview it via the web client.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Ability to upload files to the server and knowledge of the targeted user. An attacker needs to create a malicious SVG file with embedded scripts.

The fix involves:
1. Changing the default mime-type for SVG to `application/octet-string`, forcing browsers to download SVG content instead of rendering it inline.
2. Rendering SVG content within a restricted 'sandbox' iframe when the SVG mime-type is `image/svg+xml`, preventing all script execution during preview.
