The provided content relates to CVE-2019-25097.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message and the diffs indicate multiple security vulnerabilities were fixed in this commit. These include:

-   **Potential XSS:** Input sanitization was missing in several places leading to possible XSS
-   **Arbitrary file read:**  The code was vulnerable to arbitrary file reads.
-   **Path traversal:** The code was susceptible to path traversal vulnerabilities during directory listing and archive creation

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   Lack of input sanitization: The code did not properly sanitize user-provided inputs before using them in file system operations, leading to path traversal and arbitrary file read vulnerabilities. HTML characters were also not escaped before outputting leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
-   Insufficient path validation: The code failed to properly validate file paths, leading to path traversal vulnerabilities.
-   Insecure handling of filenames in archive creation: Filenames for the archive were not properly handled allowing for path traversal.
-   Lack of input validation when creating symlinks: Insufficient checks when creating symbolic links allowed symlinks to be created outside of the intended home directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary file read:** An attacker could read arbitrary files on the server leading to information disclosure.
-   **Path traversal:** An attacker could access files and directories outside of the intended directory, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure or even arbitrary code execution if an executable file was found.
-   **XSS**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts to be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Attack vectors:**
-   Manipulating directory parameters: By modifying directory parameters in requests, attackers could cause the application to access files and directories outside the intended scope.
-   Manipulating file names in archive operations: An attacker could supply malicious filenames to the archive feature in order to trigger path traversal issues.
-   Providing malicious file names when creating a symbolic link: An attacker could attempt to create symbolic links to files outside of the intended web directory.
-   Crafting requests containing malicious HTML/JS code: An attacker could inject malicious code via HTTP requests that is later executed on a users browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the web application and manipulate the request parameters to exploit these vulnerabilities. This likely means an attacker would either be a user of the application or be able to send requests to the application.
