| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c0)  Karol Babioch   2019-04-01 08:45:39 UTC  ``` krb5-appl rcp has the same CVE-2019-6111 vulnerability as openssh scp. I reported this to krbcore-security@mit.edu; they consider this package end-of-life / unsupported. I have a PoC exploit and partial mitigation patches for src/krb5-appl-1.0.1/bsd/krcp.c  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): krb5-appl-1.0.1-7.el6 krb5-appl-1.0.1-7.el6_2.1.src.rpm  How reproducible: Always.  Steps to Reproduce: 1.  Apply patch krb5-appl-2019-6111-poc.diff (available on request) 2.  Run kshd with now-evil rcp 3.1  rcp remote-host:test.txt . 3.2  rcp remote-host:dirtest.txt .  Actual results: 3.1  mode 0755 ./.badrcp.rc with nc | bash script. 3.2  mode 0755 /tmp/.badrcp.rc with same remote access script.  Expected results: Requested file, or nothing if remote file non-existant.  Additional info: My first report to bugzilla.redhat.com, apologies for any mistakes.  Not sure how you wanted "Product / Component" categorised.  The affected package is available at <http://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/linux/enterprise/6Client/en/os/SRPMS/krb5-appl-1.0.1-7.el6_2.1.src.rpm>  References: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1677794> <http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-611> ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c1)  Karol Babioch   2019-04-01 08:46:27 UTC  ``` This is related to [Bug 1121821](show_bug.cgi?id=1121821 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2019-6111: openssh,openssh-openssl1: scp client missing received object name validation"), but technically should get its own CVE as its another code base ... ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c6)  Marcus Meissner   2021-01-05 16:46:43 UTC  ``` <https://sintonen.fi/advisories/scp-client-multiple-vulnerabilities.txt>  describes the vulnerabilities  the specific one:  2. CWE-20: scp client missing received object name validation [CVE-2019-6111]  Due to the scp implementation being derived from 1983 rcp [1], the server chooses which files/directories are sent to the client. However, scp client only perform cursory validation of the object name returned (only directory traversal attacks are prevented). A malicious scp server can overwrite arbitrary files in the scp client target directory. If recursive operation (-r) is performed, the server can manipulate subdirectories as well (for example overwrite .ssh/authorized_keys). ``` [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c7)  Marcus Meissner   2021-01-05 16:51:46 UTC  ``` [https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1121821](show_bug.cgi?id=1121821 "RESOLVED FIXED - VUL-0: CVE-2019-6111: openssh,openssh-openssl1: scp client missing received object name validation")   for xref, potentially the openssh patch can be used as inspiration? ``` [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c8)  Samuel Cabrero   2021-01-11 12:01:26 UTC  ``` Hi Marcus,  I have been looking at this and verified the 'rcp' tool provided by krb5-appl is vulnerable, as it is the version provided by netkit-rsh (rsh package in SLE12 family). I am attaching the reproducer (patch for krcp.c provided by krb5-appl injecting unwanted files to the client).  Originally CVE-2018-20685 and CVE-2019-6111 were reported for OpenSSH. When it turned out netkit-rsh was also vulnerable, Debian requested CVE-2019-7282 (for the one similar to  CVE-2018-20685) and CVE-2019-7283 (for the one similar to CVE-2019-6111) for it (<https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=920486>).  As krb5-appl is also vulnerable, I think new CVEs should be requested.  I am attaching the patches for krb5-appl, they should work also for netkit-rsh (maintained by Adam Majer).  And I think Debian is still vulnerable because their patch is incomplete, OpenSSH seems to resolve the filename to an absolute path but netkit-rsh doesn't, so restrict_pattern is always NULL and the check is not performed. I will comment in their bug and propose our patches. Is there any problem with it? ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c9)  Samuel Cabrero   2021-01-11 12:04:37 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 844982](attachment.cgi?id=844982&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=844982&action=edit) Reproducer  Patch for the rcp version provided by krb5-appl injecting unwanted files to the client. ``` [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c10)  Samuel Cabrero   2021-01-11 12:06:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 844983](attachment.cgi?id=844983&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=844983&action=edit) Patch for CVE-2018-20685 ``` [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c11)  Samuel Cabrero   2021-01-11 12:07:07 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 844984](attachment.cgi?id=844984&action=diff) [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=844984&action=edit) Patch for CVE-2019-6111 ``` [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c12)  Marcus Meissner   2021-01-11 16:54:35 UTC  ``` if krb5-appl has the same code as another origin we could argue that we can use the old CVE.  otherwise we can request a new CVE  can it be traced back to other code pieces? ``` [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c13)  Samuel Cabrero   2021-01-12 09:57:22 UTC  ``` (In reply to Marcus Meissner from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=1131109#c12)) > if krb5-appl has the same code as another origin we could argue that we can > use the old CVE. >  > otherwise we can request a new CVE >  > can it be traced back to other code pieces?
