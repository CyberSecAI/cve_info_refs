[`0f0c2d8`](/pyfisch/cbor/commit/0f0c2d8a9a1447263fdf27660c9e219f0ccf974f)

Changes:

* Fix stack overflow caused by nested tags reported by Eric Rafaloff at Trail of Bits.
* [#147](https://github.com/pyfisch/cbor/pull/147) The functions 'to\_vec' and 'from\_slice' are available in `no_std` environments if `alloc` is present.

Deeply nested tags like `17(17(17(17(17(17(...17(17(17("foobar"))))...)))` may cause a stack overflow. Malicious input can exploit this to crash the program while decoding the file.

## Package

cargo

serde\_cbor
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.10.2

## Patched versions

0.10.2

## Description

Affected versions of this crate did not properly check if semantic tags were nested excessively during deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow. The flaw was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
