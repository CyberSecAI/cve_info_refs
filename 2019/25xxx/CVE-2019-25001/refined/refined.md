  "cveId": "CVE-2019-25001",
  "description": "Affected versions of the serde_cbor crate did not properly check if semantic tags were nested excessively during deserialization. This allows an attacker to craft small (< 1 kB) CBOR documents that cause a stack overflow. The flaw was corrected by limiting the allowed number of nested tags.",
