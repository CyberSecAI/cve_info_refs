### CVE-2019-25020
The content is related to the CVE ID.

- **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated REST endpoints in Scytl Secure Vote (sVote) 2.1, leading to Secure-Data-Manager admin configuration leak.
- **Root Cause:** The application's Jax-RS REST endpoints do not require authentication. Specifically, the `/sdm-ws-rest/preconfiguration` endpoint can be accessed via a POST request without any authentication.
- **Weakness:** Lack of authentication on REST endpoints that expose sensitive admin configuration data.
- **Impact:** An attacker can retrieve admin configurations by sending a POST request to the `/sdm-ws-rest/preconfiguration` endpoint. This could lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of the system.
- **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to the unauthenticated `/sdm-ws-rest/preconfiguration` endpoint.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
