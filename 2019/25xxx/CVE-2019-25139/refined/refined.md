{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The plugin lacks authorization checks in `data-save-post.php` and `data-reset-post.php`, allowing unauthenticated users to modify plugin settings.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing capability checks",
      "Lack of security nonce for CSRF protection",
      "Unsanitized user input"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated users can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code through plugin settings. They can also reset the plugin's settings, potentially disrupting the site's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `data-save-post.php` with malicious settings data",
      "HTTP POST request to `data-reset-post.php` to trigger settings reset"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs no authentication or special privileges, only the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoints of the affected WordPress website."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Input sanitization was added",
     "Nonce field was added to prevent CSRF",
     "Capability checks were implemented to restrict access to the settings page only to administrators"
  ],
