> Abstract:Being a crucial part of networked systems, packet classification has to be highly efficient; however, software switches in cloud environments still face performance challenges. The recently proposed Tuple Space Explosion (TSE) attack exploits an algorithmic deficiency in Open vSwitch (OVS). In TSE, legitimate low-rate attack traffic makes the cardinal linear search algorithm in the Tuple Space Search (TSS) algorithm to spend an unaffordable time for classifying each packet resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) for the rest of the users. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of TSE from multiple perspectives. Besides showing that TSE is still efficient in the newer version of OVS, we show that when the kernel datapath is compiled from a different source, it can degrade its performance to ~1% of its baseline with less than 1 Mbps attack rate. Finally, we show that TSE is much less effective against OVS-DPDK with userspace datapath due to the enhanced ranking process in its TSS implementation. Therefore, we propose TSE 2.0 to defeat the ranking process and achieve a complete DoS against OVS-DPDK. Furthermore, we present TSE 2.1, which achieves the same goal against OVS-DPDK running on multiple cores without significantly increasing the attack rate.

[00:00] hi everyone my name is evan tachikor and
[00:02] the talk i'm going to give you is the
[00:03] final episode of the discrepancy of the
[00:05] mega flowcast series
[00:07] as we all know obs implements a
[00:08] multi-layered cache architecture in its
[00:10] fast path
[00:11] while at the exact match cache as this
[00:13] thing suggests flows are cached by
[00:14] hashing their whole packet headers as
[00:16] they appear
[00:17] in the mega flow cache arbitrary with
[00:18] wise white carding is allowed
[00:20] this requires a more complex data
[00:22] structure and packet classification
[00:23] algorithm
[00:24] in the mfc therefore we have the tuple
[00:26] spacer scheme as a packet classification
[00:28] algorithm
[00:29] wherein entries matching on the same
[00:30] header bits are collected into two pools
[00:32] identified by the mass header bits
[00:34] within the tuple the loop is fast
[00:37] however the algorithm has to search all
[00:39] tuples sequentially until the match is
[00:40] found
[00:41] so in a nutshell a packet comes in we
[00:43] apply a mask
[00:44] look up in a corresponding tuple and if
[00:46] henry is found we stop and carry out the
[00:48] associated actions say
[00:50] forward or drop otherwise take the next
[00:52] mass
[00:53] and continue the lookup process if there
[00:55] is no match at all
[00:56] packet will be classified in a slow path
[00:58] and the corresponding tuple will be
[01:00] spawned in the mfc for future packets
[01:02] take a look at this oversimplified
[01:04] example where the flow table only has
[01:06] one atom rule
[01:07] on the tcp destination port 80 and every
[01:09] other package should be dropped
[01:11] on the bottom all possible tuples are
[01:12] shown with respect to this flow label
[01:14] when a packet with destination port 80
[01:16] is received they find a match in the
[01:18] third step
[01:18] however for the second packet with a
[01:20] different destination port the algorithm
[01:22] had to check all the 16 tuples
[01:24] so clearly if the tuple space somehow
[01:26] becomes huge we are in trouble
[01:28] the discrepancy we revealed in the
[01:30] previous episodes is that for each flow
[01:31] table there exists an easy to craft
[01:33] packet sequence when sent to oes will
[01:35] inflate the tuple space to a certain
[01:36] extent
[01:37] that for classifying each packet the
[01:39] algorithm requires an affordable long
[01:41] time eventually leading to denial of
[01:43] service
[01:43] for all workloads connected to the same
[01:45] obvious the particularly interesting
[01:47] aspect of the packet sequence is that it
[01:48] looks completely legit on the wires
[01:50] without any explicit traffic patterns
[01:52] therefore it is non-trivial to detect or
[01:54] even mitigate it furthermore since
[01:56] almost every packet spawns in your tuple
[01:57] and they last at least 10 seconds
[01:59] the attack itself is very low as my
[02:02] presentation's title suggested we have
[02:04] been dealing with this problem for a
[02:06] couple of years
[02:06] every time you get rid of some
[02:08] limitations or variables we have fixed
[02:09] before
[02:10] during the discussions of my previous
[02:12] talks it turned out that obs when
[02:14] installed by the underlying systems
[02:15] packet manager
[02:16] it's currently the path aka the fastpass
[02:19] issued by online kernel
[02:21] this means that the kernel module itself
[02:22] is maintained by the kernel developers
[02:24] and is not necessarily in line with the
[02:26] mainstream obs data path
[02:28] developed by the obs developers for
[02:30] instance the former as the kernel
[02:32] networking developers are not in favor
[02:33] of heavy caching
[02:34] does not have the emc it only has the
[02:36] mfc furthermore last time it also turned
[02:39] out that the dpdk-based obs might be
[02:41] also vulnerable
[02:42] since both the pure and the dpdk version
[02:45] essentially share the same code base
[02:47] so in its final episode we released the
[02:49] list last variable in our equations
[02:51] and scrutinized the different versions
[02:53] of obs for the evaluations we use a
[02:56] simplified kvm environment we have two
[02:58] servers each running an obs as its
[02:59] hypervisor switch
[03:00] within and between the vms we use a
[03:02] simple laption to indicate the
[03:04] performance of obs
[03:05] the attacker resides outside of the
[03:07] system and sends your malicious traffic
[03:08] trace towards acl installed in server 1.
[03:11] according to the acl around 9000 tuples
[03:13] can be generated in the mfc
[03:15] every time the attack starts at 20
[03:17] seconds with thousand bucket per sec
[03:19] rate
[03:19] if not stated otherwise obs is
[03:21] restricted to use one core only
[03:23] let's see first the case of ovs kernel
[03:25] this is the setup we also evaluated
[03:27] previously the only difference is that
[03:28] obs here is more up-to-date
[03:30] we observe nothing new here as soon as
[03:31] the attack starts and the mfc becomes
[03:33] populated the triplet quickly drops down
[03:35] to zero
[03:36] let's see now we have sourced the
[03:37] version combined manually and having the
[03:39] emc definitely switched on
[03:41] this was the most controversial
[03:43] experiment we observed and we are really
[03:44] open to discuss this later on
[03:46] first of all we can see that the
[03:47] performance goes up and down during the
[03:49] attack
[03:49] if there was only one rally in the
[03:51] beginning and the case was totally fine
[03:53] as the malicious traffic scene first is
[03:55] going through the slow path
[03:56] then cached in the mfc and due to the
[03:58] number of packets all of them can
[04:00] actually be carried in the emc
[04:02] this would disable the need for the tss
[04:03] algorithm and the mfc afterwards however
[04:06] the pattern shows
[04:07] like while the malicious traffic
[04:09] completes the emc
[04:10] right after processing it some other
[04:12] benign traffic evicts
[04:14] all previous entries from the emc
[04:15] requiring the malicious trace
[04:17] to be processed in the mfc we verify
[04:20] this behavior by
[04:21] practically spawning two new vms in the
[04:22] system and replay a different traffic
[04:24] race much faster between them to
[04:26] populate the emc
[04:27] we have seen the scene behavior so there
[04:29] should be something else in the
[04:30] background
[04:31] anyway we tried to simply increase the
[04:33] traffic rate until we observed what we
[04:35] expected the rate was found at 4000 pps
[04:37] where the performance of a single ovs
[04:39] drops down to zero
[04:40] note this attack rate is still somewhere
[04:42] around 2.5 megabits per second which is
[04:44] still very early
[04:45] finally let's see dpdk first there is a
[04:48] slightly worse
[04:49] baseline performance due to the fact
[04:51] that we're still using iperf for
[04:52] consistency which does not benefit from
[04:54] dpdk but requires context switches
[04:57] on the other hand the most important
[04:58] observation is that the performance
[05:00] researches after some time
[05:02] not back to the baseline but still and
[05:04] this is the phenomenon we are going to
[05:05] explore
[05:07] in 2016 there was a patch for ovs dpdk
[05:10] which introduces a ranking in a tuple
[05:12] space
[05:12] this means that tuples having more hits
[05:14] will be rent higher and the linear
[05:16] search process will find the matching
[05:17] entry faster
[05:18] this in our case also means that the
[05:20] malicious traffic will never be found
[05:22] first and it requires more time to be
[05:24] classified
[05:24] as a result the overall packet
[05:26] performance is still affected
[05:28] but the benign traffic can at least go
[05:30] true in order to defeat the ranking
[05:32] there are two key aspects we need to
[05:33] keep in mind
[05:34] first the linear search process itself
[05:36] starts from the end of the tuple space
[05:38] this is also highlighted in the source
[05:39] code comments second
[05:41] the tuple when inserted it is appended
[05:43] to the end of the tuple space this means
[05:45] that it will be ranked the highest as
[05:46] the linear search process will start the
[05:48] lookup at this tuple
[05:50] so the overall performance of obvious
[05:52] dpdk depends on the ranks
[05:54] the number of masks and the attack rate
[05:56] so the main idea to defeat the ranking
[05:58] is to keep it busy all the time we can
[06:01] achieve this by carefully stopping the
[06:02] malicious traffic trace to let some
[06:04] older duplos expire and hence disappear
[06:06] from the tuple space
[06:07] then we reset the traffic trace to
[06:09] respawn these tuples again
[06:10] which by the instructional algorithm
[06:12] will be again placed at the end of the
[06:13] duplo space where the linear search
[06:15] process starts
[06:16] by means of this the benign traffic will
[06:17] never get ranked high and we still
[06:19] maintain
[06:20] thousands of tuples in the mfc to reach
[06:22] this end we can run the attack for say
[06:23] 10 seconds and then pause it for two
[06:25] seconds this number can be optimized
[06:27] according to the use case
[06:28] but for this short talk i won't cover
[06:30] the details so the setting would mean
[06:31] that during the two seconds of pause
[06:33] time the first place found 10 000 tuples
[06:35] will expire
[06:36] we still have around 8 000 active tuples
[06:38] in the mfc
[06:39] while after the post period we respawn
[06:41] the 2000 tuples again
[06:43] and we continue this pattern which
[06:44] results in that the benign throughput
[06:46] can never resurge in a complete deny of
[06:48] services achieved
[06:50] let's see what happens if obs dpdk can
[06:52] scale up to multiple cores
[06:53] we observe that the previous method does
[06:55] not work even if we increase the attack
[06:57] rate tenfold
[06:58] so simply increasing the attack rate is
[06:59] not sufficient and it eventually leads
[07:01] to the original dsc attack as by faster
[07:04] looping through the traffic trace
[07:05] we don't let any tuple expire so what
[07:08] can we do then
[07:08] the idea is then to not only increase
[07:10] the attack rate but also send each
[07:12] packet multiple times
[07:13] then by maintaining a higher attack rate
[07:15] i'll duplicate generation rate can be
[07:17] the same as before
[07:18] resulting in that tuples can expire and
[07:20] respawn as a result
[07:22] we need 3000 pps and each packet to be
[07:24] repeated three times to beat obs dpdk on
[07:27] two cores
[07:27] as the cores increase we also need to
[07:29] linearly increase our attack vector
[07:31] in other words we need six thousand pps
[07:34] and six packet repetitions
[07:35] and twelve thousand pps with twelve
[07:37] repetitions to be obs on three and four
[07:39] cores respectively
[07:40] we can see that when the attack is on
[07:42] the tribute of the benign flow is zero
[07:44] and there are spikes during the pause
[07:46] periods
[07:47] since the benign triplet never resurges
[07:48] for a longer period
[07:50] the attacker is not in control of we
[07:52] consider tsc 2.1 successful

[07:56] time if you are interested in a more
[07:58] detailed study

[00:03] is going to be by levente cheek are
[00:07] from the National University of
[00:10] Singapore previously last year Levent
[00:14] presented a an earlier version of this
[00:18] work where it was part one of the
[00:22] discrepancy of the mega flow cash in OBS
[00:24] and in in this talk he will present the
[00:28] next iteration of our doom here you go
[00:30] Thank You van for a nice introduction so
[00:34] yeah as Ben said my name is La Venta
[00:37] Shakur and I came from National
[00:38] University of Singapore and this work
[00:40] was done there when my colleagues means
[00:42] who candy nail from National University
[00:44] of Singapore and Trustwave so the title
[00:48] of my presentation is the discrepancy of
[00:50] the mega flow cash you know when we
[00:51] switch is part two so let me have a
[00:53] quick recap about what part one is all
[00:55] about so in part one we actually found
[00:58] that there's an algorithmic deficiency
[01:01] in the tuple space search scheme which
[01:03] is a packet classifier using the mega
[01:05] flow cash we found that actually it's
[01:08] really easy to exploit so if we if we
[01:10] know the flow tables like according to a
[01:12] flow table which is as simple as hello
[01:14] some but drop others which is really
[01:17] usual then actually less than one
[01:19] megabits per sec attack traffic can be
[01:21] really bad so we can achieve a full
[01:24] denial of service in open we switch
[01:26] using the kernel model and we also found
[01:29] that it works in public deployments all
[01:31] kubernetes and OpenStack which were
[01:33] using open we switched it was actually
[01:36] vulnerable and it was vulnerable only
[01:38] against co-located victims so if we are
[01:40] happen to be scheduled to the same
[01:42] hypervisor then our victims then we can
[01:45] achieve this and there does they're no
[01:48] there's no mitigation available at the
[01:50] moment because it's a very low later tak
[01:52] traffic I will talk about how it works
[01:54] there's no specific epoch signature and
[01:57] and actually all the packets that are
[01:59] sending to the system to achieve this
[02:01] goal is completely legit to me so let's
[02:03] see how it works so we have a cloud
[02:05] environment here people are using some
[02:09] services and we have open with switches
[02:11] as a virtualized specular sapphires on
[02:12] all of
[02:13] and people are just using the services
[02:15] in the normal way so like accessing some
[02:17] services and things like that and now
[02:19] when the attacker comes into the picture
[02:21] what it does is to just Laser resource
[02:23] in the cloud it happened to be scheduled
[02:25] to som some of the of the device some of
[02:28] the servers and then it installs its own
[02:31] flow table and then sends back it
[02:34] towards this packet classifier and
[02:35] everyone who is happened to be scheduled
[02:37] to the same hypervisor switch becomes a
[02:40] decorated packet classification service
[02:43] so the problem is so that so let's see
[02:46] how it works usually we have just a flow
[02:48] table what is the flow table so flow
[02:50] table is actually an older set of white
[02:52] card rules operating on a set of header
[02:55] fields and also we have a couple of
[02:57] actions right we can redefine and and of
[03:01] course the flow the flow rules in the
[03:03] flow table can overlap it makes really
[03:04] easy for for network administrator to
[03:08] configure how the packets should be
[03:09] routed
[03:10] actually you know when we switch in the
[03:12] kernel-space I'm just using open we
[03:14] switch and kernel drivers I'm not really
[03:16] into the DPD kay part so to fasten the
[03:19] packet classification itself this is
[03:21] something that everyone should know I
[03:23] guess about open we switch that only the
[03:24] first packet is actually sent through
[03:26] the slow pass in the flow table to find
[03:28] how to route that specific packet and
[03:30] whenever we have a hit or any result
[03:32] then we can actually cache it and then
[03:35] it will be represented in the first pass
[03:37] and and all the subsequent packets which
[03:39] are coming into the switch will be
[03:40] handled really quickly even in the OBS
[03:43] kernel model it's really quick it can be
[03:45] 10g for instance and this is what
[03:48] actually I'm going to talk about so
[03:50] there's a tuple space or scheme the
[03:52] packet classifier which is implemented
[03:54] in the kernel model so let's see ok so
[04:00] let's see how to post based search
[04:02] actually works so we have entries
[04:03] matching on the same headers are
[04:06] collected into hashes where the masked
[04:08] packet headers can be found fast so
[04:11] usually when a packet comes in we have a
[04:13] flow table like this and we have the the
[04:15] hash is the masks and the corresponding
[04:18] hash is here
[04:19] so whenever a pocket comes in we just
[04:21] apply one of the masks and then see
[04:24] whether we can have a have a hit if
[04:27] you don't have we just go true go true
[04:28] go true and it can be really
[04:30] long-lasting in your search problem so
[04:34] this is what we can actually exploit
[04:35] here so the key finding is that if we
[04:38] are able to generate as many masks as
[04:41] possible
[04:42] in the tuple space then actually the
[04:45] more masks we have the slower the packet
[04:47] classification itself can be at the end
[04:49] so for each L rule so if you know the
[04:52] flow table for each allo rule there is a
[04:55] corresponding packet sequence to achieve
[04:57] this end so if you give me a flow table
[04:59] I can tell you what are the packets that
[05:01] need to be sent to the packet classifier
[05:03] itself to achieve the highest number of
[05:06] masks in the in the tuple space so the
[05:09] strategy or strategy was that if we know
[05:11] the flow table which is like this one
[05:14] ello destination port ap it's a typical
[05:17] flow rule actually for all the web
[05:18] services nowadays in the cloud so then
[05:21] we generate one specific packet for the
[05:23] allo rule and then we just add the
[05:25] packet with each of the relevant bits
[05:26] inserted one at a time so with one
[05:29] packet I can generate one MFC mega flow
[05:32] cash mask so let's see how it works in
[05:35] an animated way so actually the
[05:38] animation itself took more time for me
[05:41] to make than the attack itself so we are
[05:43] just sending one packet at a time and we
[05:45] are just generating all these all these
[05:48] all these masks in the system so let's
[05:50] see it's so beautiful I mean I spend
[05:52] like two hours on the flight to make
[05:56] this so this is the aim this is what we
[05:59] want to achieve and now let's see the
[06:04] numbers so for a 16-bit of destination
[06:08] port filter so if you have 16 bits then
[06:10] we can generate 60 masks if you have a
[06:11] filter for instance in this source IP
[06:13] which is 32 bits that we can generate 32
[06:16] bits 32 mask with 32 packets and that's
[06:19] only just one ello rule on one header
[06:21] field so the problem is that we can
[06:23] imagine that if we have multiple other
[06:25] rules then the whole problem can be
[06:27] really bad so it's an exponential graph
[06:29] because of there
[06:31] protect problems so if you have a simple
[06:34] flow rule or flow table which is like a
[06:36] low import ad and allow some
[06:39] communication from other viens from like
[06:40] 10.0 that 0.1 which again at a really
[06:43] typical ACL people usually implement and
[06:45] it can be 500 or and now I'm going to
[06:50] show how bad it can be so we were using
[06:54] a open V switch kernel model as I
[06:56] mentioned and although we have a melon X
[07:00] card which is capable to offload the
[07:03] caching mechanism to the hardware which
[07:05] means that it should be ready fast at
[07:07] some point but either way we found that
[07:09] actually if you are generating somewhere
[07:12] around 100 mega flow masks which is
[07:15] really simple according to the
[07:16] information that I told you just before
[07:18] then you can see that with 100 masks we
[07:22] can achieve like below 10 percentage of
[07:26] the of the attainable troop and it also
[07:29] applies for even if we you have a
[07:32] hardware full hardware offload that's
[07:34] the dotted line here so if you generate
[07:36] this is the this part actually is the
[07:39] this case so we have 8000 masks so we
[07:42] have a filter on the source IP we have a
[07:44] filter on the source port and we have a
[07:46] filter on the destination port that's
[07:47] all with 8,000 packets I can generate 8
[07:50] thousand entries in the mask and even if
[07:52] you're using a full hardware offload I
[07:54] can actually reduce the performance from
[07:56] 30 gigabits per sec which is 1 gigabits
[07:58] per second so it's a it's a really
[08:00] really a bad thing
[08:02] so let's finally talk about why am I
[08:05] here this this year so in this talk we
[08:09] are not going I'm not going to present
[08:10] any new deficiency or any new
[08:13] algorithmic old problem of the whole the
[08:16] whole packet classification itself
[08:18] I'm not going to implement another
[08:19] packet classifier and I'm not going to
[08:21] improve the packet classifier which is
[08:23] here so why I'm here is actually to talk
[08:25] about that from an attackers point of
[08:27] view can the case be even worse
[08:29] so can the attack be more generic
[08:31] without because in the in if you are an
[08:34] attacker in in in the previous case I
[08:36] needed to know what is the flow table
[08:37] and according to the flow table I could
[08:39] generate the packets but if I don't know
[08:42] the flow table then it's it's a more
[08:44] generic kind of attack
[08:45] is it possible this is the question that
[08:47] I'm investigating here is it passable
[08:49] and the other thing is that in this case
[08:51] I'm not going to be co-located with in
[08:53] any of the victims I'm trying to attack
[08:55] in the previous case I was it was
[08:58] assumed that I'm happened to be
[08:59] scheduled to the same guys and then I
[09:01] can decorate the service to the guys who
[09:02] are actually scheduled to the same
[09:04] hypervisor and of course I'm going to
[09:07] talk about what countermeasures do can
[09:09] we have because last year we didn't have
[09:11] any we're just proposing the problem
[09:13] itself and we had some talks even with
[09:15] men and the other guys that at VMware to
[09:16] figure out something okay so now the
[09:21] case is that people are again using
[09:24] services but now the attacker is just
[09:25] not randomly being scheduled to some of
[09:29] the hypervisor it figures out that okay
[09:31] I want to attack the services like the
[09:33] email services so I'm just sending the
[09:35] packets towards that hypervisor and I
[09:38] and I don't have any assumption so I
[09:40] just picked my victim send the package
[09:42] there and I try to ruin the packet
[09:44] classification on that specific server
[09:46] this is what we are trying to achieve
[09:48] here in this general in general use case
[09:54] okay so the challenge is that again we
[09:56] want to blow up the mega flow cash in
[09:58] the same way as we did before but now we
[10:00] don't know the flow table is it possible
[10:03] how much effort do we need and how
[10:06] success we can be as an attacker and
[10:09] what are the countermeasures these are
[10:10] the things that we are investigating so
[10:12] how to generate the packets that's the
[10:14] biggest question in the beginning since
[10:17] we're not aware of the flow table is
[10:18] difficult we don't know the masks we
[10:20] don't know the the hashes we don't know
[10:22] nothing actually so one might think that
[10:24] let's generate all the possible packets
[10:26] for a given header field and that we're
[10:28] good right but the problem is that it
[10:31] really requires too much effort and
[10:33] actually even if just to flow rules are
[10:35] there we all need to sound like three
[10:38] petabytes of para bits of per second to
[10:42] achieve the goal which is really easy to
[10:44] detect right even if just the port scan
[10:46] or it's it becomes a volumetric attack
[10:48] at the time it's really easy to to
[10:51] handle so I'm coming from the academia
[10:54] so what people usually think in the
[10:55] beginning that how about random things
[10:57] so random
[10:59] any algorithm which has some random
[11:01] parts happened to be successful in many
[11:04] many algorithms in the past so we just
[11:07] simply use that case okay how about
[11:09] generating random packets can we be good
[11:10] if it random packets and the thing is
[11:13] that we figured out that it's not even
[11:15] that good but it's not really bad so
[11:18] what are the chances that if I generate
[11:20] the packet I real generate a mega
[11:23] flukish messy at the same time do I have
[11:25] again an eye very nice animation here so
[11:28] the chance actually that we are
[11:30] generating a packet it will be part of
[11:33] that specific mass which is here it
[11:36] really depends on how many white card
[11:38] add bits we have in those max so we can
[11:40] see that this number actually this port
[11:43] number and The Associated hash according
[11:46] to the mask which is here we have 15
[11:49] white card at bits so it means that this
[11:52] is the probability of a random packet
[11:56] that it will generate that specific mass
[12:00] so it can be seen that it's 50 percent
[12:02] although if we want to generate a packet
[12:05] that will spawn another mega location
[12:07] tree the chances can be much worse so
[12:10] let's see how how good can we be so we
[12:13] we have a measured and the expected
[12:14] numbers according to these findings and
[12:17] we found that if we actually generate
[12:19] just thousand packets random thousand
[12:22] packets we cannot achieve thousand Meg
[12:24] of location trees as in the previous
[12:26] case but we could achieve actually
[12:27] around hundred and we saw from the
[12:31] previous plot that achieving hundred
[12:33] entries actually in the in the Magnaflow
[12:35] cache can be really bad so we can
[12:39] achieve like ten percent of the
[12:40] performance drop yes so the same attack
[12:46] rate which we had before for a
[12:48] full-blown denial of service attack if
[12:50] you're just randomly doing that without
[12:52] knowing the flow table we can achieve
[12:53] 90% performance drop which from an
[12:56] attackers point of view can be really
[12:59] appealing I would say so with
[13:04] and in our system that we have 10
[13:05] gigabits per second then we can reduce
[13:07] the performance to 1 gigabit per sec so
[13:11] what are the Contra measures so the
[13:12] detection itself is still really hard it
[13:15] we are still sending legitimate traffic
[13:17] we have no attack signature now we have
[13:19] completely no attack signature the
[13:21] packets are full random so it's there's
[13:23] no it's really difficult to to detect it
[13:25] and it's still a low attack rate so
[13:28] we're just sending a couple of thousands
[13:29] of packets per second it's not a big
[13:31] thing so we as a really preliminary
[13:35] countermeasure we developed mega flukish
[13:38] guard it's a simple application which
[13:40] tries to monitor the Magnaflow cache and
[13:42] whenever it sees that there's a lot of
[13:44] entries according to this attack it
[13:47] tries to wipe those entries out and and
[13:49] try to see whether we can be whether it
[13:52] can be a countermeasure or not so what
[13:55] how it means that the attack traffic
[13:57] actually we're going to send up to the
[13:59] slow pass again so according to how the
[14:03] caching system in OBS works so the
[14:05] benign traffic will be still handed in
[14:07] the fast pass in the cache but since we
[14:09] are wiping out all the entries
[14:10] corresponding to the attack the attack
[14:12] packets will be sent upwards this is how
[14:14] we try to this is this is how we try to
[14:16] achieve our goal so usually this is how
[14:19] it looks like so we have the benign
[14:20] useful traffic and of course we also
[14:23] have the attack traffic which is a low
[14:24] later track terrific they are crossing
[14:26] through them at the kernel space and
[14:28] then we are just figuring out we see how
[14:31] how big hedgerows actually we are you're
[14:37] having at the moment and then we just
[14:39] remove all the corresponding entries
[14:41] from the cache it's not a
[14:42] straightforward test but we have movie
[14:45] as DP CT I'll comment to control the the
[14:48] cache itself so we can remove some
[14:50] entries and then it would result in that
[14:54] all the attack traffic's are now going
[14:55] up to this low pass but useful traffic
[14:58] will still be in the fast pass and we
[15:02] found that actually if we clean the mega
[15:04] flow cache in this way then it's
[15:06] successful in terms of as a
[15:08] countermeasure
[15:09] so the normal troop will be reached
[15:11] again although we found a neater
[15:15] document and nor expected behavior
[15:17] because usually one would think that if
[15:18] I send again a packet up to this low
[15:21] pass then it will again catch that entry
[15:23] and put it back right so I would need
[15:25] like a continuous monitoring mechanism
[15:27] which will always delete the entries
[15:28] although we found that whenever we
[15:31] removed an entry with the DP CTR comment
[15:33] then it won't be cached anymore
[15:35] it was an interesting thing I guess I
[15:38] didn't even ask Ben and he said that
[15:40] there's no documentation actually
[15:42] available so it's now no one really
[15:45] wants to do that so people are people
[15:47] are not really interested in that
[15:48] oh so it means that whenever I delete an
[15:53] entry corresponding to attack traffic I
[15:55] will have an increased over overhead for
[16:00] the CPU because now all the attack
[16:02] traffic will be handled by this low pass
[16:03] which is really bounded by the CPU and
[16:05] all the resources that we have in our
[16:07] system what we can see here is that if
[16:10] the random packets are coming in is like
[16:13] one kilo packet per sec rate and now I'm
[16:16] sending those 1 kilo packets up to this
[16:18] low pass all the time then actually I
[16:21] have a 15% of overhead in the CPU and I
[16:24] was just using top regular common aleinu
[16:26] stuff to see see how it changes and if
[16:30] you're sending much more traffic so this
[16:32] traffic it's per sec traffic as we seen
[16:35] before it's enough for an for a 90
[16:38] percentage of performance drop in this
[16:40] random case so we can actually avoid
[16:43] this by some extra 50% of overhead
[16:46] although if the attacker is really bad
[16:48] and it tries to make as many mega
[16:50] flukish entries as possible
[16:52] we can still handle this attack by
[16:53] wiping out the entries from the mega
[16:55] flow cash but then it makes like 80% of
[16:58] overhead and it can be it can be even
[17:00] even higher if the if the rate is again
[17:03] higher so this is a live recorded demo
[17:07] we had so we have the true put here I
[17:11] try to show here as well so in the and
[17:13] and we are going to launch the attack so
[17:17] we have a monitor for the true put on
[17:18] the bottom and we have a monitor here
[17:20] the number of caches in the system so
[17:22] this is how they increase so what you
[17:24] can see here is that I'm sending the
[17:26] hard packets then the mega flow cash and
[17:29] freedom
[17:29] the magnification number
[17:30] our increasing here and then I can see
[17:32] how the performance drops here now I
[17:35] didn't want it to have a full-blown
[17:36] denial of service attack just just a
[17:38] simple one so I'm generating hundred or
[17:41] something entries and then we were using
[17:45] a typical
[17:47] offloading technique then I can achieve
[17:49] a degradation of service here so now
[17:54] yeah I'm already after the point that I
[17:56] cleaned the Magus okay so that was the
[17:57] one from terminal up above so then I
[18:01] cleaned the Magnaflow cache and then the
[18:03] attack can be the the useful performance
[18:06] can be going up again to to its normal
[18:09] one yeah so that's that was just live
[18:13] demo so the problem is actually we need
[18:16] a more sophisticated algorithm than that
[18:17] so now I'm currently just wiping out all
[18:19] the drop rules for instance from the
[18:21] cache well we need to maintain a good
[18:25] balance between the between the CPU
[18:27] overhead and the Troopa that we can
[18:29] achieve in the Fast Pass so we were also
[18:32] thinking about whether to have a
[18:34] dynamically set time timeout in the mega
[18:37] floor cache so normally as far as I know
[18:40] whenever there's an entry in the in the
[18:42] cache it will be warm for ten seconds so
[18:44] when there is no corresponding packets
[18:46] it will be wipe out automatically but
[18:48] maybe we should not have a uniform 10
[18:51] seconds of timeout maybe we should have
[18:52] a dynamically set timeout so whenever we
[18:55] have a hit we for instance in the
[18:57] beginning all the entries have a timeout
[18:58] of one second and whenever we have a hit
[19:00] then we increase it to two second and if
[19:03] you have more hit than we are increasing
[19:05] it up to ten seconds so it can be a
[19:06] dynamically set and that can actually be
[19:10] helpful on the other hand one can think
[19:14] about prioritization so how about
[19:16] prioritizing the masks which are for the
[19:18] useful traffic and not for the not for
[19:21] the bad traffic so these are just some
[19:23] things that we are considering at the
[19:26] moment but we only implemented the
[19:29] simple one which I show you so as a
[19:32] conclusion we have we have this
[19:34] tuplespace
[19:34] algorithm which has an algorithmic
[19:36] deficiency and it's implemented in the
[19:38] kernel space for packet classification
[19:39] and it can be the algorithmic deficiency
[19:42] itself can be exploited by an attack
[19:44] quite easily so we demonstrated this
[19:47] tuplespace explosion attack which can
[19:50] launched against the infrastructure why
[19:52] a collocation that was a part one talk I
[19:54] had last year and then we can achieve a
[19:56] full-blown denial of service and now we
[19:59] are capable to launch the attack again
[20:01] any arbitrary service not with not a
[20:04] full-blown denial of service but we can
[20:06] decorate the service significantly and
[20:09] now we have at least a really simple but
[20:11] still working countermeasure which is a
[20:13] mega foolish guard which keeps the
[20:15] Fastpass clean for the benign traffic
[20:18] thank you that would be my presentation
[20:21] and we have a QR code here which
[20:23] actually points to some website where
[20:25] all the fresh results about this
[20:28] research is maintained thank you let's
[20:34] thank our speaker so we have some time
[20:39] for questions does anybody want to ask
[20:41] one
[20:51] presentation thanks very much I'm I
[20:52] wondered have you considered a
[20:54] particular technique that I kind of
[20:56] refer to as sub table folding so you
[20:58] mentioned that you have this explosion
[20:59] of different tables where each one has a
[21:02] unique mask whereas you could consider
[21:04] an approach where until a package or
[21:06] until a particular table has let's say
[21:08] more than ten flows or ten ten packets
[21:11] hitting that that you essentially always
[21:13] compute all the data for that and in
[21:15] that way you don't have this explosion
[21:17] anymore because you kind of put all of
[21:18] them in the worst case bucket from an
[21:20] algorithmic point of view I think this
[21:21] bounds the maximum number of tables you
[21:24] can have at the expense of doing more
[21:26] compute for each packet that hits that
[21:28] table
[21:28] I was wondering had you considered
[21:29] something like this before and if you
[21:30] had what your thoughts were thank you
[21:34] for your question actually everything
[21:36] which you said makes sense we really
[21:39] didn't want to touch how the algorithm
[21:41] itself works
[21:42] so it's I guess maybe in the deep in the
[21:44] deep edk version you're running a DP
[21:46] Tiki t-shirt so there's a reason why I'm
[21:48] asking you so I guess in the DPD K
[21:50] version all this we don't really have
[21:52] this problem at all and the other
[21:55] question I mean I guess your main
[21:57] question is actually directed to the to
[21:59] the developers themselves so it really
[22:01] depends on how they are going to change
[22:04] this so we just just wanted to show the
[22:07] problem itself thank you so I believe
[22:15] your heuristic is trying to detect an
[22:16] attacker but then why are you trying to
[22:19] continue giving service to it like why
[22:21] not just completely cut him off are you
[22:23] afraid of false positives is that the
[22:25] aim if I get the question
[22:32] properly so us why don't we just try to
[22:34] send as many packets as possible to have
[22:36] a full-blown denial service all the time
[22:45] that's a that's the that's the next step
[22:48] how you will do what will you do
[22:50] whenever you detect itself so it's a the
[22:55] problem is that it's really difficult to
[22:56] detect so whenever in so usually when
[22:58] you have the service degradation by a
[23:00] simple monitoring algorithm in a cloud
[23:02] will not tell you that there is a
[23:04] problem some of your users or service
[23:06] your tenants will be asking you that
[23:08] hey I'm experiencing a really bad
[23:10] performance what what is happening and
[23:12] then as an operator you can check what's
[23:15] happening and then you can also at the
[23:17] end carry out the necessary steps but
[23:21] until that it can be I guess hours or
[23:24] even days to to find find this and then
[23:27] you can block it of course
[23:37] you studied other kind of
[23:39] denial-of-service with a few pockets for
[23:42] a goal or revalidate ER or other table
[23:45] have you explored other possible
[23:48] vulnerabilities and if not is it in your
[23:50] plans we have not really explored any
[23:58] other possibilities so the reason why
[24:00] I'm actually here is to get some inputs
[24:02] from the guys who are close to the
[24:03] working source codes and working
[24:05] solutions so thanks thanks about that
[24:09] and we will check how they can be
[24:11] applied do you have any questions online
[24:15] I don't think we've taken in here No did
[24:21] I see a question back there so one more
[24:30] thing I'd like to point out is at the
[24:32] point we're at the point where the
[24:35] number of tuples is increasing the flow
[24:40] ad you know if you are trying to do any
[24:42] kind of offload to kernel you're going
[24:45] to experience a head of line blocking
[24:46] over there because the number of tables
[24:50] you're matching
[24:51] do you see that as a problem um did you
[24:56] consider that there might be a head of
[24:58] line blocking for valid flows that are
[25:02] going to have to match a fair number of
[25:05] tuples when the number of tuples in a
[25:07] tuple space goes up significantly like
[25:12] in this attack that you're talking about
[25:19] so the thing is that actually what you
[25:22] can see here can be also the result of a
[25:25] normal operation so in open we switch we
[25:27] also have another like another so the
[25:30] caching architecture itself is
[25:31] multi-layered so we have a micro flow
[25:32] cache which is below the mega flow cache
[25:34] which is an exact match cache and it
[25:37] tries to some kind of somehow alleviate
[25:39] this issue so if we have multiple caches
[25:42] then we can cope with many difficult
[25:46] packets and routing system so the thing
[25:47] is that what you are actually mentioning
[25:49] is that
[25:50] is there any upper bound for a software
[25:52] package classifier and there will always
[25:54] be so with micro flow caches and mega
[25:57] flow caches we can easily handle
[25:59] thousands or hundreds of thousands of
[26:01] flows quite efficiently and after after
[26:05] a above that you need some other
[26:07] solutions you need other offloading
[26:08] techniques or or better algorithms all
[26:12] right we're out of time for questions
[26:14] but I bet levente would love to talk
[26:16] about this in more detail during the
[26:18] during the breaks or the lunches let's
[26:21] thank our speaker one more time
[26:22] [Applause]

## Abstract

Efficient and highly available packet classification is fundamental for various security primitives. In this paper, we evaluate whether the de facto Tuple Space Search (TSS) packet classification algorithm used in popular software networking stacks such as the Open vSwitch is robust against low-rate denial-of-service attacks. We present the Tuple Space Explosion (TSE) attack that exploits the fundamental space/time complexity of the TSS algorithm.TSE can degrade the switch performance to 12% of its full capacity with a very low packet rate (0.7 Mbps) when the target only has simple policies such as, "allow some, but drop others". Worse, an adversary with additional partial knowledge of these policies can virtually bring down the target with the same low attack rate. Interestingly, TSE does not generate any specific traffic patterns but only requires arbitrary headers and payloads which makes it particularly hard to detect.Due to the fundamental complexity characteristics of TSS, unfortunately, there seems to be no complete mitigation to the problem. As a long-term solution, we suggest the use of other algorithms (e.g., HaRP) that are not vulnerable to the TSE attack. As a short-term countermeasure, we propose MFCGuard that carefully manages the tuple space and keeps packet classification fast.

# Summary

Packet classification is one of the fundamental building blocks of various security primitives and thus it needs to be highly efficient and available. In this paper, we evaluate whether the de facto packet classification algorithm (i.e., Tuple Space Search scheme, TSS) used in many popular software networking stacks, e.g., Open vSwitch, VPP, HyperSwitch, is robust against low-rate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

We present the Tuple Space Explosion (TSE) attack that exploits the fundamental space/time complexity of the TSS algorithm. We demonstrate that the TSE attack can degrade the switch performance to as low as 12% of its full capacity with a very low packet rate (i.e., 0.7 Mbps) when the target packet classification only has simple policies, e.g., "allow a few flows but drop all others".

We also show that if the adversary has partial knowledge of the installed classification policies, she can virtually bring down the packet classifier with the same low attack rate.

The TSE attack, in general, does not generate any specific attack traffic patterns but some attack packets with randomly chosen IP headers and arbitrary message contents. This makes it particularly hard to build a signature of our attack traffic for detection. Since the TSE attack exploits the fundamental complexity characteristics of the TSS algorithm, unfortunately, there seems to be no complete mitigation of the problem. We thus suggest, as a long-term solution, to use other packet classification algorithms (e.g., hierarchical tries, HaRP, Hypercuts) that are not vulnerable to the TSE attack.

As a short-term solution, we propose MFCGuard, a monitoring system that carefully manages the entries in the tuple space to keep packet classification fast for the packets that are eventually accepted by the system.

## Switching Stacks for Virtualization

Enterprises increasingly offload business-critical workloads to the public cloud to benefit from low infrastructure costs, high availability, and flexible resource provisioning. Reliable and efficient service provisioning heavily depends on the ability to efficiently switch traffic between the tenants' workloads and the outside world.

In this paper, we use OVS as our running example, but the presented vulnerabilities might affect other TSS-based software switches (e.g., VPP [1], Hyperswitch [2], GSwitch [3]). OVS [4] is an open source, multilayer, production quality software switch that enables massive network automation through programmatic extensions [5]. It can be managed remotely through standardized control plane protocols [6, 7]. The OVS flow table describes the packet processing behavior to be implemented by the switching logic at a high level. Due to its flexibility, generality, and community support, OVS has been extensively used in cloud deployments [5].

The flow table of an OVS switch is an ordered set of flows, where each flow is a pair of (1) a wildcard rule, operating on specific protocol header fields (e.g., IP source address, ports) and designating packets that belong to the flow, and (2) an action, a set of packet processing primitives to be applied to packets matching the flow rule; e.g., “forward to port”, or “drop”.

![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LcGhYy9l_VxF8Z6zlsOQbGe_gVYCo5IKlDtXbuoDhYDF9sCXe7scmkl6DT4KUzmT06GebZ5ls4GEDwHXAF2EpSgML-NChJpm9sMKuc0BhMndV9eK=w1280)

Two flows in the flow table are said to overlap if there is a packet header that matches both. In this case, the matching flow that occurs first in the flow table takes precedence. For instance, in the sample ACL in Fig. 1, a packet with source IP address 10.0.0.1, source and destination ports 34521, and 443, respectively, matches both the second and the last flow entries with the first flow overriding the last one by higher priority. Accordingly, here we define several use cases according to the number of different header fields *an* *allow rule* matches on besides the *only* *deny rule*. In particular, the use case of destination port only (Dp), source port and destination port (SpDp), source IP and destination port (SipDp), and all previous three (SipSpDp), contains flow rule #1, flow rules #1 and #3, flow rules #1 and #2, and all flow rules, respectively.

In contrast, a flow table in which all rules are disjoint is order-independent because all packets have a single matching rule and equal priority (i.e., order is irrelevant). In general, this makes packet classification much simpler [8].

Most software switches (if not all) support order-dependent flow tables despite the performance benefit of order-independent tables because of the flexibility of the former. In virtualized environments (e.g., multiple tenants share a single software switch for access control), users with various networking knowledge configure the flow rules in the switches. The greater flexibility of order-dependent tables support rule wildcarding and flow priorities, which allow complex packet processing logics to be described concisely.

## TSS for Fast Packet Classification

To cut down the prohibitive cost of packet classification, OVS adopts the well-known fast path/slow path separation principle [9]. The fast path comprises two layers of flow caches, and the slow path implements a complete representation of the flow table serving as a fallback when the fast path cannot decide on the fate of a packet. Only the first packet of each flow is subjected to full-blown flow-table processing, i.e., slow path, and the resulting flow-specific rules and actions are then registered in the flow caches; the rest of the flow’s packets take the fast path. This amortizes the cost of packet classification over subsequent packets of a flow, contributing to increased performance without loss of expressiveness and generality.

Within the fast path, the microflow cache implements a per-transport-connection exact-match store where lookup occurs over all header fields, while the megaflow cache (MFC) bundles multiple microflows into a single megaflow to impose common processing to the entire bundle.In this design, the microflow cache merely serves as “short-term” memory and it is often exhausted even in normal operation (by default, it contains only a couple of hundred entries). The lookup algorithm in the MFC relies on the TSS scheme [10], the prevailing packet classifier used to implement ACLs in other hypervisor switches as well (e.g., VPP [1], HyperSwitch [2], GSwitch [3]). MFC generally saves on cache entries by a single megaflow covering, say, all incoming HTTP connections regardless of the source TCP port (i.e., TCP port wildcarded). In a nutshell, this is done by collecting the entries matching on the same set of header bits into a hash in which masked packet headers can be found fast. Then, masks and associated hashes are searched sequentially until the first matching entry is found.

Note that the TSS implementation in OVS does not know about flow priorities; thus the slow path ensures that MFC entries are all disjoint to make packet classification simpler yet introducing worst case exponential complexity (i.e., exhaustive linear search in the different masks). Correspondingly, as long as the number of masks is kept in a reasonable range (e.g., couple of hundreds masks), packet processing in the fast path is close to line rate. This property of the TSS is the very logic we aim to exploit.

We show that even with a random packet sequence we can achieve the TSS implementation in OVS to produce thousands of masks significantly increasing the look up time of a given packet that can eventually bring down the whole packet processing to its knees.

# Threat model

We consider a general virtualized computing environment, where a targeted software switch is used for packet processing and basic network operations. This includes a typical multi-tenant cloud infrastructure whereby tenants lease resources in the cloud to deliver public services. Tenants may use cloud management system (CMS) APIs to set up their access-control list (ACL) rules in the underlying software switch to access-control, redirect, or log accesses to different resources [11, 12, 13, 14]. We consider that the internal algorithms of the data plane fabric is fully known to adversaries.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/9hoZQCbg0W6RVO6QEIHwRT3BEtky5fqQ-nGbJhSfcXuAcA0WUJfEJe32zkBxnF05Ul0kA5W-ySCulpEf0i6pSEzlTslXNnZNMO2I_DBz1z-GvEYJ=w1280)

The attacker’s goal is to send some attack packets to the virtual switch, which when subjected to the implemented ACL will exhaust the underlying resources denying access to the rest of the users. The adversary only needs to have the capability of crafting and sending IP packets with arbitrary legitimate headers without being filtered at the first hand; e.g., by her upstream or transit ISPs. Note that we do not require any privilege of the target switch for the effective DoS attack. However, having some partial, internal state of the target switch (e.g., installed ACL rules) can further improve the efficiency (i.e., less number of required attack packets). Here, we do not consider volumetric DoS attacks that congest the target‘s network bandwidth with attack traffic.

# Two variants of our Tuple Space Explosion attack

In a nutshell, to achieve the highest number of MFC masks with the smallest effort, the crafted packet sequence needs to be on par with the installed flow rules (see more details in the paper). Correspondingly, being aware of the ACL itself is a key aspect to the efficiency of the TSE attack. Thus, we present two different approaches of the TSE attack each posing different requirements and targets for the attacker.

In order to explain the main differences between them, and their practical targets, we need to understand a key abstraction in a cloud environment: the per-user virtual switches tenants configure to set up their ACLs. Tenants perceive these virtualised resources as their own physical switch, however switches are only logically separated and all of them are implemented and managed by the same individual software switch instance. Therefore, all workloads happened to be scheduled to the same hypervisor inherently share the switching fabric as well (e.g., the MFC).

## Co-located TSE

We build on top of this abstraction: the attacker has leased resources in the cloud, which inherently makes him/her capable of installing ACLs into its own virtual switch. Then, the shared MFC can be easily populated with new masks by targeting the known ACLs. However, co-location comes at a price that only those tenants’ workloads are affected that happened to be scheduled to the same hypervisor.

## General TSE

In this approach, we alleviate the restrictions of Co-located TSE: we consider the case when the attacker has neither resources in the cloud, nor knowledge about any ACLs. Here, we investigate how much more effort an attacker needs in order to achieve the same efficiency as Co-located TSE.

# Denial-of-Service

## Co-located TSE

As can be seen in the figure (note the log scale on the *y* axis), the more MFC masks are generated, the worse the throughput becomes due to the significantly increased packet processing time. We evaluated the impact with several hardware offloading features to see whether the more efficient hardware implementation also suffer from this phenomenon; for TCP connections, hardware offloading preserves the high throughput for hundreds of masks and the performance only starts to drop afterwards. UDP traffic, on the other hand, cannot benefit from hardware offloading.

Without offloading (GRO OFF) or in case of UDP, after reaching only a handful of masks (Dp=17 masks), the throughput already halves. Having a couple of hundreds of masks (SpDp=260, SipDp=516) already brings down the overall throughput to 0.2 Gbps from the nominal throughput of 10 Gbps. Mounting thousands of masks (SipSpDp=8200) results in a complete denial-of-service attack, where new flows cannot even be established.

While hardware offloading indeed can help mitigating the effect, after thousands of masks, the performance also drops to below 1 Gbps.

Observe the effect on the flow completion time of 1GB of TCP traffic when hardware offloading is switched off (on the secondary *y* axis).

## General TSE

While with the Co-located TSE, we can simply achieve the targeted number of MFC masks to fully bring down the packet classifier, in the General TSE (i.e., when we are not aware of the ACL rules), we can only send random packet with random contents.

Correspondingly, we calculated the expected number MFC masks that can be achieved with a given number of random packets. Observer the figure on the left hand side, where on the *x* axis the number of different random packets is shown, while the *y* axis depicts the expected (E) and measured (M) (averaged over 100 runs) MFC masks.

Observe that the more different header fields the ACL consists of the more MFC entries can be spawned with the same number of random packets. In particular, the maximum attainable MFC masks (with 50, 000 packets) are approx. 16, 121, 122, and 581 in case of Dp, SpDp, SipDp, and SipSpDp, respectively. In terms of service degradation, these results mean that General TSE can reduce the full capacity with GRO OFF to 52% (97% with GRO ON, 88% with FHO, 60% with UDP), 12% (96% with GRO ON, 87% with FHO, 15.8% with UDP), and 1% (73.5% with GRO ON, 25.5% with FHO, 3.25% with UDP), respectively.

# Mitigation

Besides, several immediate yet impractical remedies might help: (i) deploying or offloading ACL implementations to a different hypervisor switch (e.g., [1, 2, 3]) or to the (ii) high-performing gateway appliance (e.g., [15]), (iii) switching the MFC completely off, or (iv) enabling advanced flow caching via DPDK-based OVS datapath [16]. However, each of the above has the following corresponding disadvantage: in case of (i) other implementations might suffer from the same attack (e.g., [1]) or (ii) they do not help against attacks initiated within the DC, for (iii) MFC has been the biggest performance improvement so far [17], and for (iv) the feature that may prevent the attack is available in select datapaths.

## MFCGuard

As a more customized mitigation technique we developed **MFCGuard**, which monitors and modifies the MFC— if the number of masks exceed a certain threshold, it looks for patterns corresponding to a possible TSE attack in every 10 seconds according to the MFC expiration period, and wipes out those entries accordingly. We observed that monitoring (and modifying) the MFC has no overhead on the performance.

In essence, removing an entry from the MFC means that matching packets will be processed in the slow path again. Since the slow path would spark the same MFC entries again, the idea behind **MFCGuard** was to constantly keep those entries out of the fast path. In practice, however, we observed that once an MFC entry is deleted then it will never be sparked again, i.e., matching packets will always be processed by the slow path. Such undesired, unexpected and undocumented behavior [18] can have serious performance penalties; although MFC entries can be manually re-injected.

There are several requirements **MFCGuard** needs to meet: (i) entries covering the useful traffic should never be deleted. Furthermore, (ii) according to the available resources, we can only remove select flows from the MFC to find a balance between the maximum performance of the fast path and the increased resource utilization by the slow path; both impacting the overall quality of the run services. Due to requirement (i) MFCGuard will only remove entries with drop action! With this simple yet important requirement, only adversarial packets will be subjected to the slow path, keeping the fast path accelerated for the useful traffic flows (cf. Alg. 2 in §11.4). In our current implementation, we have therefore focused on (i), and keep you updated about (ii) here.

We evaluated the efficiency of **MFCGuard** in all use cases (by deleting all drop rules) and observed that once the MFC is “cleaned”, the performance of the victim’s traffic goes back to its baseline. As the slow path is becoming much more involved, we evaluated the system’s load in such cases.

Results are depicted on the left hand side, where *x* and *y* axes show the attack rate and the corresponding CPU usage of the slow path daemon (*ovs-vswitchd*), respectively. It can be seen that as long as the attack rate is less than 1, 000 pps (< 1 Mbps) the slow path only consumes 15% of the CPU; note, this packet rate can be enough to bring down OVS).

However, when the packet rate is 10, 000 pps, the CPU load jumps up to ≈ 80% (this rate in case of General TSE would be enough to degrade the full capacity to 10%). We can conclude that our current **MFCGuard** implementation is already capable of efficiently mitigating both TSE attacks as long as the attacking rate is low. If the attack rate is much above 10, 000 pps, the attack becomes a volumetric attack, for which there are multiple solutions to detect and handle (e.g., excess amount of packets and over-provisioning).

# Further updates

Below, we are summarizing some approaches to alleviate the issue either as a mitigation or as a prevention technique. We are already working on some of them, while others are collected here from other "collaborators" who have raised some new approaches during disseminating the work.

### Sophisticated MFCGuard

Currently, MFCGuard simply removes all "bad-looking" entries from the MegaFlow Cache, however as discussed above, it can put much more pressure on the CPU if too many flows are sent up to the slow path. A sophisticated algorithm would look for the exact attack flows by applying the findings of the TSE attack itself, i.e., according to the flow table, it is possible to see which masks are the results of a possible TSE attack.

**Possible disadvantage:** During the generic TSE attack where not just the necessary packets to spawn the relevant MFC masks and hashes are sent, but more and higher entropy random packets, masks can look like completely different and identifying which packets are part of the TSE attack is much more difficult.

### Prioritize

Masks and associated hashes corresponding to the benign traffic should be prioritized during the linear search process. This would mean that even if we blow up the tuple space, the benign traffic would hit an entry during the packet classification in a(n upper-) bounded number of steps. Such masks (and associated hashes) should be derived from the flow table. For instance, in case of having two allow rules matching on the TCP destination port and source IP address then these masks would be (80/ffff, 10.0.0.1/ffffffff).

**Possible disadvantage:** However, one might consider then the number of allow rules can be increased to a certain amount, where the above-mentioned upper bound would also scale up, at some point, still having the issue (i.e., when the number of allow rules reaches much more than 100).

### Dynamically set MFC masks timeout

Generally, each masks and entry in the MFC has a timeout of 10 seconds, i.e., an entry is kept warm for 10 seconds, if there is no more matching packets, the entry will be freed up to make space for more relevant flows. Here, we consider that whenever a new MFC mask (and hash) has been created, it should have a timeout of 1 second. If there is a hit for the same mask, then its timeout can be increased to 2 seconds. Then, the whole process for each particular mask can repeat until the max timeout (e.g., 10 second) is reached.

**Possible disadvantage:** It only makes the attack difficult in the beginning! If the attacker keeps sending the same traffic with the same rate (or maybe in a higher rate if needed) in the beginning, then s/he can reach the timeout of 10 seconds quite easily in a short time frame (i.e., depending on the rate required for a specific packet sequence, time frame can be within ten(s) of seconds or might be in a couple of minutes).
