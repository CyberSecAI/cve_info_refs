The provided content describes a vulnerability in Apple iPhones where Siri can be unintentionally triggered by specific audio patterns in videos, without the "Hey Siri" command being spoken.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is likely due to specific audio frequencies or resonance within the device's casing that are misinterpreted as the "Hey Siri" command. This is more likely to occur at low volume levels, which may cause voice recognition to behave differently.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Incorrect audio processing: The audio processing algorithm incorrectly interprets certain audio patterns as the "Hey Siri" command.
- Self-referential audio triggering: The audio output of the device itself can trigger the voice assistant, leading to unintended actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could craft a video containing the specific audio patterns necessary to trigger Siri. This could allow them to control the device through Siri commands, including:
    - Accessing and displaying stored information
    - Changing device settings

**Attack Vectors:**
- Playing a crafted video: The primary attack vector involves playing a specifically crafted video that contains the required audio trigger, typically through a service like YouTube.
- Device position: The effectiveness of the trigger can depend on the position of the device and audio volume level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to create and upload videos: Attackers need the ability to create videos containing specific audio patterns, which may require trial-and-error testing
- Ability to publish videos online : The attacker would need to be able to host and share video content (e.g., via YouTube)

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered on iPhones running iOS 12.3.1
- Apple initially did not consider this a security risk and did not address the vulnerability.
- The issue was observed to be resolved in iOS 13 without any explicit mention in security advisories.
