Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-25073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper path sanitization within the `FileHandler` function of the `goadesign/goa` package. Specifically, the function did not adequately prevent directory traversal attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `FileHandler` was susceptible to path traversal attacks via the `../` sequence in the request URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read files outside the intended directory that the server process has access to. This could expose sensitive information such as configuration files, source code, or data files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting malicious HTTP requests containing `../` sequences in the URL path targeting the `FileHandler`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers only require network access to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any user privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details**

- The vulnerability exists in the `FileHandler` function that is used to serve files from a specified directory.
- The initial check for path traversal was insufficient and could be bypassed using `../`.
- The fix implemented in commit `70b5a199d0f813d74423993832c424e1fc73fb39` introduced a more robust check by:
    - Using `os.IsPathSeparator` to handle different path separators correctly.
    - Implementing a counter to track directory traversal attempts.
    - Returning `ErrNotFound` if traversal beyond the mount point is detected.
