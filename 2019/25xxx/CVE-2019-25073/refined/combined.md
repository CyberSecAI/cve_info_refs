### @christi3k **[christi3k](/christi3k)** commented [Nov 22, 2019](#issue-527462813)

Presently `FileHandler` allows `../` which enables directory path traversal when a `Files` endpoint is defined with a wildcard.

Example API design definition:

```
var _ = Resource("docs", func() {
	Description("Documentation endpoint")

	Origin("*", func() {
		Methods("GET", "OPTIONS")
	})

	Files("/docs/*filepath", "swagger-ui")
})

```

Example exploit:

```
curl "http://localhost/docs/..%2F..%2F..%2Fetc%2F"

```

This patch updates `FileHandler` to return `ErrNotFound` if a `../` is found in `req.URL.Path`.

I wanted to submit tests along with this but got stuck trying to make them work. If someone could provide guidance, I would be happy to make another attempt.

Existing tests do pass:

```
$ make test
Ginkgo ran 25 suites in 1m1.149089831s
Test Suite Passed
go test ./_integration_tests
ok  	github.com/goadesign/goa/_integration_tests	20.423s

```

Additionally, I've applied this patch to a local dev instance of our app and verified the changes operates as expected. A curl request such as the one does return a 404.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thank you for the PR, this is great! I wonder if it wouldn't be more robust to use [os.PathSeparator](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#PathSeparator) though instead of hard-coding the file path separator - this would alleviate the need to check for both types of separators which could actually result in faulty behavior (e.g. if a unix file has a backslash in its name). Another (better?) approach would be to use [IsPathSeparator](https://golang.org/pkg/os/#IsPathSeparator) instead of a custom function to splice. |

### **[christi3k](/christi3k)** commented [Dec 4, 2019](#issuecomment-561422840)

| Thanks for the suggestion to use IsPathSeparator. I've updated the isSlashRune() function to use it.  While I was at it, I also adjusted the check to allow:   * `..` in filenames (legal in \*nix and Windows, I believe) * relative paths using `..` *within* the defined path mount point (but not outside/above)   `make tests` all passed and I tested a few different paths with a running version against our app. |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
