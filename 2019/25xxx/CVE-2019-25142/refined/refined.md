        "ID": "CVE-2019-25142",
        "content": "The WordPress Mesmerize theme version 1.6.89 and below and Materialis theme version 1.0.172 and below fixed a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated user to modify WordPress core options in the database.\n\nThe vulnerability exists in the `companion_disable_popup` function. This function only checks the nonce and then passes two user inputs, `$_POST['value']` and `$_POST['option']`, to the WordPress `update_option` function. Because the banner is displayed to any logged-in users, as well as its security nonce in the HTML source of every page, an authenticated user can copy the nonce and use it to send an AJAX request to modify WordPress core options.\n\nAn authenticated user such as a subscriber can exploit this vulnerability to change WordPress core options in the `wp_options` table. The value of `$_POST['value']` must be an integer or numerical string and can be used by an attacker to enable user registration or comments, to disable all plugins, or crash the blog.\n\nThe vulnerability was reported to the wordpress.org team on November 23, 2019 and two new versions 1.6.90 (Mesmerize) and 1.0.173 (Materialis) were released on November 25, 2019.",
        "root_cause": "The `companion_disable_popup` function does not properly validate user-supplied data before passing it to the `update_option` function.",

            "Missing Authorization",

        "attack_vectors": [
            "An authenticated user (e.g., a subscriber) can copy the nonce from the HTML source of a page.",
            "The attacker sends a crafted AJAX request with the stolen nonce and desired option and value to be updated."

         "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the WordPress admin panel and be able to view HTML source of any page."
