The provided content is related to CVE-2019-25093.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `recentthread_forumskip` setting when used in an SQL query. The `recentthread_forumskip` setting, which contains a comma-separated list of forum IDs to ignore, was being directly concatenated into an SQL query without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through SQL injection. Specifically, by injecting malicious Javascript in the `recentthread_forumskip` setting it is possible to execute arbitrary Javascript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code through the `recentthread_forumskip` setting and execute this code on other users' browsers who view content affected by this setting. This can be used to perform various malicious actions like session hijacking, phishing etc.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `ACP->Config` setting, specifically `recentthread_forumskip`. An attacker needs to be able to modify this setting within the application's administration panel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have access to the application's administration panel (ACP) and have the permission to modify the configuration settings (specifically `recentthread_forumskip`). The commit message states "Classified as low risk due to needing access to ACP->Config".
