Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the plugins' failure to sanitize the content of "text/plain" emails before converting them to HTML format. This allows arbitrary HTML code to be injected into the "text/html" part of the email.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sanitization when converting plain text to HTML email content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can inject malicious HTML to create fake login forms or other deceptive content within emails, tricking administrators into revealing sensitive information.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Attackers can embed malicious links or forms that, when clicked by the administrator, could trigger unintended actions on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through any message sent via the blog, its plugins, or themes that uses the affected plugins to convert emails to HTML. This includes comments, contact forms, notifications, and other similar email sending mechanisms.
- An attacker can inject malicious HTML into any text input that will be used for plain text email body, such as a comment form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker only needs to be able to submit content through a channel that results in an email being generated and sent using one of the vulnerable plugins, such as submitting a comment or contact form.
- No specific privileges are required.
- The attacker does not need to be logged in.

**Affected Plugins:**
- Email Templates <= 1.3
- WP HTML Mail â€“ Email Designer <= 2.9.0.3
- WP Email Template <= 2.2.10

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported to the wordpress.org team on October 16, 2019.
- The Email Templates plugin was patched in version 1.3.1.
- The blog post mentions that the lack of sanitization in WordPress plain text emails is intentional, as the emails are expected to be plain text, not HTML. The vulnerability arises when plugins convert these unsanitized plain text emails into HTML format without proper encoding or sanitization.
