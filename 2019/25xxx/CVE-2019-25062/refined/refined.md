{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the 'add user' functionality of Sricam DeviceViewer application.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application does not properly validate the length of the username input, leading to a buffer overflow when a long string is provided.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target system, in this case, demonstrated by a command shell.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered locally by providing a specially crafted string as the username when adding a new user.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker requires local access to the system with the vulnerable application installed and must be able to interact with the 'User Management' feature. The attacker needs to log in the Sricam DeviceViewer application first."
