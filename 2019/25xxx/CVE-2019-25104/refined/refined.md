Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `G_Alloc` for memory allocation within the `AICast_ScriptLoad` function and related parsing functions in `code/game/ai_cast_script.c`. `G_Alloc` uses a fixed-size memory pool (`POOLSIZE`), which can be exhausted by rapidly changing teams in the game menu or spamming team change commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The game's team change command handler uses the `G_Alloc` function which allocates memory from a limited pool. Rapidly changing teams leads to numerous memory allocations using `G_Alloc`. Since the pool has a fixed size, it can be quickly exhausted.
- **Denial of Service:** When the memory pool is exhausted, `G_Alloc` fails and the server crashes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is the crashing of the game server, leading to denial of service for all connected players.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted team change commands over the network. This can be done by rapidly changing teams in the game menu or through a malicious script or client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the game server.
- **Ability to send commands:** The attacker needs the ability to send team change commands to the server. This is typically achieved by being a player on the server or through a modified client.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in the function `AICast_ScriptLoad` of the file `code/game/ai_cast_script.c`.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to replace `G_Alloc` with `trap_Alloc`. `trap_Alloc` allocates memory via system calls, not from a fixed-size pool.
- The commit `f2cd18bc2e1cbca8c4b78bee9c392272bd5f42ac` implements the fix.
- The CVE was assigned to the issue in [rtcwcoop/rtcwcoop#45](https://github.com/rtcwcoop/rtcwcoop/pull/45)

The provided data gives a very clear picture of the vulnerability, its root cause, and the fix.
