* This release fixes one major issue that has been assigned [CVE-2019-25016](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-59xc-99wg-3hgf "CVE-2019-25016").

  Rules that allowed the user to execute any command would inherit the

  executing users PATH instead of resetting it to a default PATH.

  The path will now be correctly reset ([d5acd52](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/commit/d5acd52e2a15c36a8e06f9103d35622933aa422d)) to the defined default PATH.

  Those rules still allow the user to execute any program from their PATH

  but executed commands won't inherit the users PATH anymore.

  Rules that limit the user to execute only a specific command are not affected

  by this and are only executed from the default PATH and with the PATH

  environment variable set to the safe default.

Other changes are:

* apply missing man page changes
* Fixes to the configuration parser [2d7431c](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/commit/2d7431ca9ec0b3204a5e9fd01d0fffd946c4d430), [01ac841](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/commit/01ac84109c99e94bf61c0a4039c76b8af289c499) and [36cc28e](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/commit/36cc28e4446e77ab4d8d48055e9715f1ae26c68e)
* Minor documentation and error message wording changes.

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your GitHub account as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

## Description

![@ivan3182](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10415408?v=4&size=48)[ivan3182](https://github.com/ivan3182)opened [on Jan 28, 2021](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/issues/45#issue-796144041)

OpenDoas version: 6.8

System: Gentoo, Debian 10

/etc/doas.conf content: `permit :wheel`

*man doas* says that variable PATH is set to value appropriate for the target user, but current value preserves:

```
user@gentoo /etc
> $ env | grep ^PATH
PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/lib/llvm/10/bin

user@gentoo /etc
> $ doas env | grep ^PATH
doas (user@gentoo) password:
PATH=/home/user/.local/bin:/home/user/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/lib/llvm/10/bin

```

expected value:

```
user@gentoo /etc
> $ su -l
Password:
gentoo ~ # env | grep ^PATH
PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/opt/bin:/usr/lib/llvm/10/bin

```

# OpenDoas: Insufficient environment filtering — GLSA **202107-11**

A vulnerability in OpenDoas could lead to privilege escalation.

### Affected packages

| Package | **app-admin/doas** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **6.8.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **6.8.1** |

### Background

OpenDoas allows users to run commands as other users.

### Description

OpenDoas does not properly filter the PATH variable from the resulting
shell after escalating privileges.

### Impact

A local attacker with control of a user’s PATH variable could escalate
privileges if that user uses OpenDoas with a poisoned PATH variable.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All OpenDoas users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=app-admin/doas-6.8.1"

```

| [Description](#c0)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-28 21:33:47 UTC  ``` "There is an unsafe incomplete reset of PATH in OpenDoas 6.6 through 6.8 when changing the user context."  See <https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas/issues/45> for more discussion:  "Thanks for the report, this is indeed a bug and this not matching the documentation I consider it a security issue and have requested a CVE for it (CVE-2019-25016), this used to be the default behavior but should have been correctly changed in 2019.  One nuance about this is that the users PATH will be used when executing the first command if the rule allows any command, so with the rule permit :wheel, PATH=~/bin doas foo will execute foo from ~/bin. If the rule limits the execution to a specific command then the "safe" PATH is used, permit :wheel cmd foo would not execute ~/bin/foo (in this case the reset the PATH variable was already correct before this fix).  This means before the fix, users who only had access to execute a specific command were not able to execute other command through a "unsafe" PATH.  Users who were allowed to execute anything could change PATH to execute more things from PATH." ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-01-30 04:00:19 UTC  ``` Please bump to 6.8.1.  (NOTE: Provisionally calling it C1, but not super happy with that classification.) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2021-01-30 21:37:28 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=1bc1b8dc0675ff0ff0c6d7c5b9576d3f6808bbdd>  commit 1bc1b8dc0675ff0ff0c6d7c5b9576d3f6808bbdd Author:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2021-01-30 21:37:21 +0000 Commit:     Sam James <sam@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2021-01-30 21:37:21 +0000      app-admin/doas: security bump to 6.8.1          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/767781>     Package-Manager: Portage-3.0.14, Repoman-3.0.2     Signed-off-by: Sam James <sam@gentoo.org>   app-admin/doas/Manifest          |  1 +  app-admin/doas/doas-6.8.1.ebuild | 51 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++  2 files changed, 52 insertions(+) ```   [Comment 3](#c3)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-01-30 21:40:52 UTC  Comment hidden (obsolete)  ``` Unable to check for sanity:  > no match for package: app-admin/doas-6.8.2 ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-02-01 08:26:57 UTC  ``` arm64 done ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-02-01 08:27:33 UTC  ``` arm done ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-02-01 08:29:09 UTC  ``` amd64 done  all arches done ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-02-01 08:29:43 UTC  ``` Please cleanup! ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-30 15:56:14 UTC  ``` Cleanup done:  commit 30e45562f3aa3d48e64d08fe5db01b39c84e42ca Author: Joonas Niilola <juippis@gentoo.org> Date:   Sat Mar 20 09:10:15 2021 +0200      app-admin/doas: drop 6.0, 6.6.1, 6.8      Signed-off-by: Joonas Niilola <juippis@gentoo.org>   delete mode 100644 app-admin/doas/doas-6.0.ebuild  delete mode 100644 app-admin/doas/doas-6.6.1.ebuild  delete mode 100644 app-admin/doas/doas-6.8.ebuild ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  John Helmert III   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2021-05-30 16:49:52 UTC  ``` New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  NATTkA bot   gentoo-dev  2021-06-30 18:44:36 UTC  ``` Unable to check for sanity:  > no match for package: app-admin/doas-6.8.1 ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2021-07-07 08:05:28 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 202107-11 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202107-11> by GLSA coordinator Sam James (sam_c). ``` |  |
