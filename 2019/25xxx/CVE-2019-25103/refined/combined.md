inlineCode: Fix ReDoS & improve escape semantics

```
Our inline code regex had overlapping parts in the case of spaces;
spaces could be parsed as part of the `\s*`s or as part of the
`[\S\s]*`, which leads to catastrophic backtracking in the case of
a string with many spaces.

The `\s*` parts were attempting to allow for escaping of backticks
within the start/end of inline code blocks, so this commit removes
the `\s*` parts of the regex, and then after parsing the code block,
checks for the case where a single space is being used to escape
a backtick, and removes that space.

Test plan:

1. Added a test for the semantics change.
2. Added a test for the exponential backtracking to match the test
   case in issue [#71](https://github.com/ariabuckles/simple-markdown/issues/71)
```
