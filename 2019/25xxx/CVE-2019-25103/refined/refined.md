The provided content relates to CVE-2019-25103.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an inefficient regular expression (regex) used to parse inline code blocks in the `simple-markdown` library. The regex had overlapping parts when handling spaces, which could lead to catastrophic backtracking (ReDoS). Specifically, spaces could be parsed either as part of the `\s*` (zero or more whitespace characters) or as part of the `[\s\S]*` (any character, including newlines, zero or more times), which caused exponential backtracking when processing strings with many spaces.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Inefficient Regular Expression (ReDoS):** The core weakness is a poorly constructed regex that can lead to exponential backtracking.
- **Overlapping Regex Parts:** The regex allowed multiple ways to parse spaces, causing the regex engine to explore many possibilities and become stuck when processing inputs containing a large number of spaces.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit the ReDoS vulnerability by providing crafted markdown input containing a large number of spaces within or around inline code blocks. This would cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time, making the application unresponsive and leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Crafted Markdown Input:** The attack vector involves providing malicious markdown input specifically crafted to trigger the inefficient regular expression. The input would need to have a significant number of spaces within or around inline code blocks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to supply markdown input:** The attacker needs to be able to supply markdown text to the `simple-markdown` library. This could be through a web application that processes user-provided markdown, a command-line tool, or any other context where the library is used to parse markdown text.
