The provided content is related to CVE-2019-25095. It describes a vulnerability fix in the ldapcherry project, specifically addressing a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in URL redirection.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application was using base64 encoding for passing the URL in the query string during redirection, which was vulnerable to XSS. An attacker could craft a malicious URL, encode it with base64, and inject it into the redirect parameter. When the application decodes this, the malicious code could be executed in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of user-controlled data (URL redirection).
- Lack of proper escaping/sanitization of URL parameters.
- Using base64 encoding to pass URL parameters which doesn't prevent XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could perform XSS attacks by crafting malicious URLs and tricking users into clicking them, which would execute malicious javascript in the user's browser in the context of the application.
- This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing XSS payload.
- The attacker gets the user to visit the application, which redirects with the crafted URL, causing the malicious code to be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and get the victim to interact with the application.

**Fix:**
The vulnerability was fixed by:
  - Switching from base64 encoding to URL encoding using `urllib.quote_plus` for passing the URL in the query string.
  - Applying HTML filtering to Mako output by default (except for nested templates in `adduser`, `modify`, and `selfmodify`). This was later fixed in a subsequent PR (https://github.com/kakwa/ldapcherry/pull/17) to properly escape form values in nested templates.
