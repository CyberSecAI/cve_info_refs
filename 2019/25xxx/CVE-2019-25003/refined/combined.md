## Package

cargo

libsecp256k1
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.3.1

## Patched versions

0.3.1

## Description

Versions of libsecp256k1 prior to 0.3.1 did not execute `Scalar::check_overflow` in constant time. This allows an attacker to potentially leak information via a timing attack. The flaw was corrected by modifying `Scalar::check_overflow` to execute in constant time.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
