The Funnel Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the activate\_plugin function in versions up to, and including, 1.3.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to activate any plugin on the vulnerable service.

# Privilege escalation vulnerability fixed in WordPress CartFlows plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [November 7, 2019 - 7:20pm [+0700]November 7, 2019 - 7:20pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/privilege-escalation-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-cartflows-plugin/)

The WordPress [CartFlows](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cartflows/) plugin, which has 30,000+ active installations, fixed a privilege escalation vulnerability affecting version 1.3.0 and below.

### Reference

*A CVE ID has been requested and we’ll update this post when it is assigned.*

### Authenticated Plugin Activation

In the “classes/class-cartflows-importer.php” script, the plugin registers the `cartflows_activate_plugin` hook inside the `__construct` method:

```
add_action( 'wp_ajax_cartflows_activate_plugin', array( $this, 'activate_plugin' ) );

```

The `activate_plugin` function is located line 1639:

```
/**
 * Ajax action to activate plugin
 */
public function activate_plugin() {

   $plugin_init = isset( $_POST['plugin_init'] ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['plugin_init'] ) : '';

   $activate = activate_plugin( $plugin_init, '', false, true );
...
...

```

Because the function doesn’t check the user capabilities and lacks a security nonce, an authenticated user such as a subscriber could activate any plugin on the blog.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the authors on November 04, 2019 and a new version 1.3.1 was released on November 06, 2019.

### Recommendations

Update as soon as possible if you have version 1.3.0 or below installed.

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.
