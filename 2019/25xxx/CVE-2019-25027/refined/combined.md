# Reflected cross-site scripting in default RouteNotFoundError view in Vaadin 10 and 11-13

Severity:

 Medium (Base score 6.1) [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

CVE entry:

 [CVE-2019-25027](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-25027)

## Overview

Missing output sanitization in default `RouteNotFoundError` view in `com.vaadin:flow-server` versions 1.0.0 through 1.0.10 (Vaadin 10.0.0 through 10.0.13), and 1.1.0 through 1.4.2 (Vaadin 11.0.0 through 13.0.5) allows attacker to execute malicious JavaScript via crafted URL.

See [CWE-81: Improper Neutralization of Script in an Error Message Web Page](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/81.html)

## Description

Due to missing output sanitization, the default `RouteNotFoundError` view could be used to execute unwanted JavaScript in a user's browser if the user opens a specially crafted URL.

## Affected products and mitigation

Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation or upgrade. Releases that have fixed this issue include:

| Product version | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Vaadin 10.0.0 - 10.0.13 | Upgrade to 10.0.14 or newer 10 version |
| Vaadin 11 - 12 | No longer supported. Upgrade to 13.0.6 or newer version |
| Vaadin 13.0.0 - 13.0.5 | Upgrate to 13.0.6 or newer version |

Please note that Vaadin versions 11-13 and 15-17 are no longer supported and you should update either to the latest 14 or 18 version respectively. Also, updating to Vaadin 7 is only available to extended-support customers.

## Artifacts

| Maven coordinates | Vulnerable version | Fixed version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| com.vaadin:flow-server | 1.0.0 - 1.0.10 | ≥ 1.0.11 |
| com.vaadin:flow-server | 1.1 - 1.3 | N/A |
| com.vaadin:flow-server | 1.4.0 - 1.4.2 | ≥ 1.4.3 |

As error template is html, and the input used in it is taken from the path, which can be anything, the input needs to be sanitized before added to the template to avoid possible XSS injection.
