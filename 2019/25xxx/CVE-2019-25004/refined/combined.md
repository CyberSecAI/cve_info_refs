[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-gx73-2498-r55c/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

flatbuffers
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

>= 0.4.0, < 0.6.1

## Patched versions

0.6.1

## Description

The implementation of impl Follow for bool allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a bool.

In Rust bool has stringent requirements for its in-memory representation. Use of this function allows to violate these requirements and invoke undefined behaviour in safe code.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Description

![@nagisa](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/679122?u=66d559914b9aa9e3eb004b14040fcb66abaf3a23&v=4&size=48)[nagisa](https://github.com/nagisa)opened [on Sep 24, 2019](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/issues/5530#issue-497917126)

The implementation `impl Follow for bool` is defined [here](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/cbdf82e2fbd73db8402ba83a6635049f097d8e3b/rust/flatbuffers/src/primitives.rs#L283) and ends up calling `read_scalar_at::<bool>(...)`. `read_scalar_at` (defined [here](https://github.com/google/flatbuffers/blob/cbdf82e2fbd73db8402ba83a6635049f097d8e3b/rust/flatbuffers/src/endian_scalar.rs#L164)) is for all intents and purposes a `transmute` and therefore given a byte that is not exactly `0` or `1` will produce a value of `bool` that has an invalid underlying bit pattern. That is UB in Rust. Invoking it is as easy as

```
bool::follow(b"\x42", 0)
```

or something along the lines.

* `<=0.6.0`

### Description

The implementation of `impl Follow for bool` allows to reinterpret arbitrary bytes as a `bool`.

In Rust `bool` has stringent requirements for its in-memory representation. Use of this function
allows to violate these requirements and invoke undefined behaviour in safe code.
