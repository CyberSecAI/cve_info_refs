You can check it yourself comparing the wining chances of lotteries on different ¬´bet vs prize¬ª combinations. As example, we will take one of the [most known lottery in the US](https://www.megamillions.com/Winning-Numbers.aspx). Player needs to select 5 numbers from 1 to 70 (white balls) and 1 number from 1 to 25 (gold ball). The ticket costs $2, and to win i.e $4 you need to guess 1 white ball and a gold ball. The winning chance is 1 : 89. Playing Ethex, you can double your bet if you guess just ¬´any letter¬ª. Winning chance is 1 : 2.7. It says Ethex has x 33 times more chances to win üòâ | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |

I asked multiple devs I trust and I am waiting for results. if they confirm that there is no multiple ways to convert that hex to integer and if the statement above returns true. I will come and apologise about being rude and offensive, also I will delete all my early posts about rigged jp. but I will keep writing about the payouts. I dont care how much goverments pay to specific type of gambling. All I care is if ur math behind is fair to your players or not. you can still easly say minimum guess is at least 3 spots and we dont pay guessing one spot correct out of 3. I can still accept that but if you wont pay 2 out of 3 correct guesses by multiplying both odds. that shows ur platform is unfair. as I explained above guessing two spots even or odd correctly has to be A LOT MORE than \*2,56 even if I come to apologize about jp's, it wont change the fact that your payouts are not mathematically FAIR !!! | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  | | | --- | --- | |  |  | | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | |
