  "cve": "CVE-2019-25031",
  "description": "Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Unbound, a validating, recursive, caching DNS resolver, by security researchers of X41 D-SEC located in Aachen, Germany. Integer overflows, assertion failures, an out-of-bound write and an infinite loop vulnerability may lead to a denial-of-service or have a negative impact on data confidentiality.",
