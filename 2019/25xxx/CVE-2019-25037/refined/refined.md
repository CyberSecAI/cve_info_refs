Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-25037:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The provided information indicates that CVE-2019-25037 is one of several vulnerabilities affecting Unbound.  Specifically, it is related to "Integer Overflows" in size calculations, which can lead to a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflows:** The core weakness is the presence of integer overflows in size calculations that are later used in memory allocation functions (like `malloc()`). These overflows occur because the size calculations are not properly protected against results exceeding the maximum value that the integer can store.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact of exploiting the integer overflows is a denial-of-service. This is because the overflow could cause `malloc` to allocate less memory than is needed or lead to other unexpected behavior which then causes the software to crash. 

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by specially crafted network packets sent to the Unbound server

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send malicious network packets to the vulnerable Unbound server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is exploitable without authentication.

**Summary of CVE-2019-25037:**

The content from `ostif.org` and `security.netapp.com` details that  CVE-2019-25037 involves integer overflows in Unbound DNS that lead to a denial of service. The issue arises from the lack of protection against integer overflows when calculating sizes before memory allocation. This can be exploited by attackers who can send specially crafted network packets.

The `lists.debian.org` content further confirms that this CVE, alongside others, was addressed in a security update for Debian 9 (stretch).
