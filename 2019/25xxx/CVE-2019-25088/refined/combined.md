### @dangoscomb **[dangoscomb](/dangoscomb)** commented [Jul 1, 2019](#issue-462734539)

XSS vulnerability reported as part of a pentest, this escapes the user input when printing back to the title of the page.

I've had a brief look around and can't find any other user input that's rendered back in to a page.

Sorry, something went wrong.
