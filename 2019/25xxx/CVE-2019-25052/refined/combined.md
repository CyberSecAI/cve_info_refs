cryp: prevent direct calls to update and final functions

With inconsistent or malformed data it has been possible to call
"update" and "final" crypto functions directly. Using a fuzzer tool [1]
we have seen that this results in asserts, i.e., a crash that
potentially could leak sensitive information.

By setting the state (initialized) in the crypto context (i.e., the
tee_cryp_state) at the end of all syscall_*_init functions and then add
a check of the state at the beginning of all update and final functions,
  we prevent direct entrance to the "update" and "final" functions.

## Affected versions

## Description

With inconsistent or malformed data it has been possible to call “update” and “final” crypto functions directly. Using a fuzzer tool [1] we have seen that this results in asserts, i.e., a crash that potentially could leak sensitive information.

By setting the state (initialized) in the crypto context (i.e., the `teecryp_state`) at the end of all `syscall*_init` functions and then add a check of the state at the beginning of all update and final functions, we prevent direct entrance to the “update” and “final” functions.
