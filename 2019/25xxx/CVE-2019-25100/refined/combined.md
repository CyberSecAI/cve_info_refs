# SQL-Injection in pointdata2.php #42

[New issue](/login?return_to=)[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy link[New issue](/login?return_to=)[Jump to bottom](#comment-composer-heading)Copy linkClosedClosed[SQL-Injection in pointdata2.php](#top)#42Copy link![@crocodile-bit](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21025757?v=4&size=80)
## Description

![@crocodile-bit](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21025757?v=4&size=48)[crocodile-bit](https://github.com/crocodile-bit)opened [on Jul 9, 2019](https://github.com/happyman/twmap/issues/42#issue-465642512)

In the pointdata2.php file, you can use the GET parameter "id" to execute your own SQL statements. An example exploit is:

/twmap3/data/ajaxCRUD/pointdata2.php?id=1%20OR%201=1

The problem can be solved by first escaping the parameter (line 12):

$id = mysqli\_real\_escape\_string ($mysqliConn, $\_GET ['id']);

In addition, the parameter must then be put into a string environment in the query (line 22):

$sql. = "where id = '$id'";

After that, the $id parameter can no longer be misused for SQL injection attacks.

The vulnerability also exists in the ajaxCRUD\_old directory
