Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-25100:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an SQL injection in the `pointdata2.php` file. This file uses a GET parameter "id" to construct an SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The code directly incorporates the value of the `id` GET parameter into the SQL query, without sanitization or proper escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the input from the `id` parameter, allowing an attacker to manipulate the query.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary SQL execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
*   **Data Breach:** This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data, including user information, application data, and other potentially confidential information.
*   **Data Manipulation/Loss:** Attackers could modify or delete data.
*   **Denial of Service:** In some cases, attackers may be able to disrupt the application or cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET request:** The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP GET request to the `pointdata2.php` file, manipulating the `id` parameter to inject SQL code.
*   **Example exploit:** `/twmap3/data/ajaxCRUD/pointdata2.php?id=1%20OR%201=1` demonstrates a simple SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Understanding of SQL:** The attacker needs knowledge of SQL to craft appropriate injection payloads.
*   **No authentication required**: The vulnerability is directly accessible via HTTP requests without requiring prior authentication.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in both the `twmap3/data/ajaxCRUD/pointdata2.php` and `twmap3/data/ajaxCRUD_old/pointdata2.php` files.
*   The fix involves escaping the parameter using `mysqli_real_escape_string` and enclosing the parameter in quotes in the query.
*   The fix is implemented in commit `babbec79b3fa4efb3bd581ea68af0528d11bba0c`.
