## Description

![@csagan5](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/32685696?u=9b6a54e3bda3b7fc87116488a1dc14f460f9b545&v=4&size=48)[csagan5](https://github.com/csagan5)opened [on Oct 11, 2017](https://github.com/bromite/bromite/issues/2#issue-264605079)

This issue composes of multiple parts:

* ~~a new tab/UI to manage the adblocking feature~~ will not implement this
* logic to download the adblock filters and store them
* logic to parse the adblock filters (or an intermediate format)
* users can of course customize where the adblock filters come from (URLs)

The projects we could look at are adBlock and uBlock origin and other browsers that implement such functionality.
