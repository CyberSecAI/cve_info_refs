CVE-2019-25149: Authenticated Plugin Deactivation Vulnerability in Gallery Images Ape WordPress Plugin

- Root cause of vulnerability: Improper authorization. The plugin loads the ape_gallery_setup function via the WordPress AJAX API and passes the $_POST['plugin'] user input to the WordPress deactivate_plugins function without checking the user capabilities.
- Weakness: Missing capability checks when deactivating plugins.
- Impact of exploitation: Authenticated attackers with any capability level can deactivate any plugin on the site, including plugins necessary to site functionality or security.
- Attack vector: By exploiting the AJAX API endpoint 'wp_ajax_ape_gallery_setup' with a crafted POST request containing the 'plugin' parameter.
- Required attacker capabilities: Authenticated user with any capability level.
