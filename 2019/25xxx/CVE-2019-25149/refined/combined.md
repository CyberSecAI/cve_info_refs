# WordPress Ape Gallery plugin fixed authenticated arbitrary plugin deactivation vulnerability.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [December 30, 2019 - 2:26pm [+0700]January 7, 2020 - 6:56pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/wordpress-ape-gallery-plugin-fixed-authenticated-arbitrary-plugin-deactivation-vulnerability/)

The WordPress [Ape Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gallery-images-ape/) plugin (6,000+ active installations) fixed a vulnerability in version 2.0.6 and below that could allow an authenticated user to deactivate any plugins on the blog.

### Authenticated Plugin Deactivation

In the “gallery-images-ape/libs/modules/setup/setup.class.php” script, the plugin loads the `ape_gallery_setup` function via the WordPress AJAX API:

```

add_action('wp_ajax_ape_gallery_setup',	array($this, 'ape_gallery_setup') );
...
...
public function ape_gallery_setup(){

   if( isset( $_POST['plugin'] ) )
      deactivate_plugins( $_POST['plugin'] );
...
...

```

It passes the `$_POST['plugin']` user input to the WordPress `deactivate_plugins` function without checking the user capabilities, hence allowing an authenticated user such as a subscriber to deactivate any plugins on the blog.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was reported to the wordpress.org team on December 09, 2019 and version 2.0.7 was released on December 26, 2019.

### Recommendations

Update as soon as possible if you have version 2.0.6 or below installed.
