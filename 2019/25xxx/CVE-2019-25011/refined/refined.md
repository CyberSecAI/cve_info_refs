- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of filtration of user-supplied input in the `comments` parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected content.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker sends a POST request to a vulnerable page with a crafted `comments` parameter containing the malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and able to submit content to the vulnerable parameter.
