- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application directly uses the `X-Forwarded-For` header from the HTTP request, which can be manipulated by the client, to determine the client's IP address.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** IP address spoofing via the `X-Forwarded-For` header. The application trusts the client-provided `X-Forwarded-For` header without proper validation or sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can disguise their IP address in the application's logs by manipulating the `X-Forwarded-For` header. This can hinder incident response and potentially allow the attacker to evade detection. The attacker can also manipulate the data being sent to other parts of the application.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker manipulates the `X-Forwarded-For` header in the HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application, which can be achieved by acting as a client or through a proxy.
