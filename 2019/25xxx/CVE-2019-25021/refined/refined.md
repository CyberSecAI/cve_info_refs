Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The Scytl Secure Vote (sVote) application uses an OrientDB database and the application's source code contains hardcoded default credentials for accessing this database. The username and password are both set to "admin".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Hardcoded credentials: The application uses the same default username and password ("admin") for database access, making it a significant security flaw.
- Lack of proper access control: The application does not enforce strong password policies, or restrict access to sensitive data within the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: An attacker can gain full access to the OrientDB database using the hardcoded credentials.
- Data Breach: The attacker can access, modify or delete data within the database, potentially impacting the integrity of the election system and exposing sensitive information such as votes, user data and election configurations.
- Full system compromise: If the database contains sensitive configuration details, this may lead to a full system compromise and potentially manipulation of the election process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network access: An attacker who can access the database server via network (local or remote), can attempt to authenticate using the default credentials.
- Internal access: Any user or process running within the system can potentially use these credentials to access the database if they are in a position to make database connection calls to the server where the database is located.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the database server, or ability to execute code within the environment.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable application and the fact that default database credentials are hardcoded.

**Additional notes**
- The vendor was notified but has not fixed the issue as of Feb 13, 2020
- The vulnerability was discovered by the "SUID" research team.
