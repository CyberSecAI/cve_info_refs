### @jasonbahl **[jasonbahl](/jasonbahl)** commented [Jul 10, 2019](#issue-466539789)

## What does this implement/fix? Explain your changes.

Public requests shouldn't be able to filter users by role. This ensures that if the users connection is filtered

Before this, an unauthenticated user could make a request like the following:

```
query getUsers{
  users(where:{role:ADMINISTRATOR}){
    edges{
      node{
        userId
        name
      }
    }
  }
}

```

Get a response like:

```
{
  "data": {
    "users": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "userId": 1,
            "name": "root"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

And the requestor would be able to determine which users are admins.

With this fix, the same request could be sent and the following response would be provided:

```
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "Sorry, you are not allowed to filter users by role.",
      "category": "user",
      "locations": [
        {
          "line": 2,
          "column": 3
        }
      ],
      "path": [
        "users"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "data": {
    "users": null
  },
}

```
## Does this close any currently open issues?

closes [#890](https://github.com/wp-graphql/wp-graphql/issues/890)

## Any other comments?

Includes tests!

## Where has this been tested?

**Operating System:** Mac OSX 10.14.5

**WordPress Version:** WP 5.2.2

## WordPress Plugin Vulnerabilities

# WP-GraphQL < 0.3.5 - Improper Access Control

### Description

The plugin doesn't properly restrict access to information about other users' roles on the affected site. Because of this, a remote attacker could forge a GraphQL query to retrieve the account roles of every user on the site.

### Proof of Concept

query getUsers{
users(where:{role:ADMINISTRATOR}){
edges{
node{
userId
name
}
}
}
}

### Affects Plugins
