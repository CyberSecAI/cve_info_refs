  "CVE-2019-1000018": {
    "description": "It was discovered that rssh incorrectly handled certain command-line arguments and environment variables. An authenticated user could bypass rssh's command restrictions, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary commands.",
    "root_cause": "rssh incorrectly handled certain command-line arguments and environment variables, specifically related to the `scp` command with the `PKCS11Provider` option.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incomplete verification of scp command arguments",
      "Bypass of intended command restrictions."
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted scp command executed on the server side via ssh",
       "Using the PKCS11Provider option to load a malicious shared object file.",
       "Using the -o PKCS11Provider option via command line",
       "Using a crafted .ssh/config file with PKCS11Provider set.",
       "Specifying a crafted ssh_config file via -F rssh.config option."
      
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Authenticated user access to the rssh restricted shell."
    ],
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is present in the `allowscp` option, which aims to restrict users to only scp file transfers, not arbitrary command executions. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass these restrictions by uploading a malicious shared object (.so) file and setting the `PKCS11Provider` to that file via the ssh command."
