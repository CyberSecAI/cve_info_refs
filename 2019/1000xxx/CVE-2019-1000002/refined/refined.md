The provided content is related to CVE-2019-1000002.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A malformed request to the `DeleteFilePost` endpoint in go-gitea allowed for arbitrary file deletion. Additionally, it was possible to manipulate the `.git` directories via `editFilePost` and `UploadFilePost`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient validation of the file path in `DeleteFilePost`.
- Manipulation of `.git` directories through `editFilePost` and `UploadFilePost`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers could delete arbitrary files on the server, leading to data loss and potential service disruption.
- Attackers could potentially corrupt the git repository by manipulating the `.git` directory.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted request to the `DeleteFilePost` endpoint with an arbitrary file path.
- Sending malformed requests to `editFilePost` and `UploadFilePost` to manipulate the .git directory.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints. This would likely require the attacker to be authenticated user with the ability to interact with the affected file endpoints.
