Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-1000031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the way the `article2pdf` WordPress plugin handles the generation and deletion of PDF files. When a PDF is requested, the plugin creates the file, then redirects the user to a separate URL for download and subsequent deletion. However, the deletion of the PDF file is tied to the download request, not the initial generation request. If the redirect isn't followed, the temporary PDF file persists on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The core issue is the failure to remove the generated PDF files after their creation if the user does not follow the redirect to download them.
*   **Improper File Handling:** The plugin does not delete files properly if the download is not initiated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can repeatedly trigger PDF generation without downloading them, leading to the accumulation of files and eventually exhausting disk space. This can cause a DoS for the target WordPress site and potentially other services if disk space is shared on the same server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited by sending a request to the initial PDF generation URL of the `article2pdf` plugin and not following the redirect. This can be done repeatedly to fill up the server's disk space.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target website.
*   No special privileges are needed; an unauthenticated user can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was present in `article2pdf` WordPress plugin version 0.24 and higher.
*   The issue was reported on the plugin's bug tracker and later identified as a vulnerability by a third party.
*   The WordPress security team disabled downloads of the affected plugin.
*   This CVE is related to another vulnerability (CVE-2019-1010257) in the same plugin that allows arbitrary file access due to insufficient sanitization of user input, but this CVE is only about the resource exhaustion vulnerability.
