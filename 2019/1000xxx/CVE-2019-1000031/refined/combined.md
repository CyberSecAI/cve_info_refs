# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# [article2pdf (Wordpress plug-in)] Multiple vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-1000031, CVE-2019-1010257)

---

*From*: Christian Lerrahn <cybersec () drwaryaa com>

*Date*: Tue, 26 Mar 2019 12:31:25 +1100

---

```

Product: article2pdf (Wordpress plug-in)
Product Website: <https://wordpress.org/plugins/article2pdf/>
Affected Versions: 0.24 and greater

```
The following vulnerabilities were found in a code review of the
plug-in. An attempt to contact the
plug-in maintainer on 8 December 2018 was unsuccessful. The Wordpress
security team disabled downloads
```

of the plug-in upon notification on 8 January 2019.

```
I would like to thank Ken Johnson (@cktricky) and Set Law (@sethlaw)
whose course
"Seth & Ken's Excellent Adventures in Secure Code Review" sparked my
interest in reviewing code for
```

vulnerabilities.

```
[CVE-2019-1000031] Generated PDF file is only removed after download
which is initiated by a redirect
```

=====================================================================================================
Type:
-----
Resource Exhaustion

Description:
-----------
The plugin generates a PDF version of a post/article when a link of the
form

<https://www.example.com/.../my-post-title/?article2pdf=1>

is visited. The response to this initial request is a redirect to a link
like

<http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/article2pdf/article2pdf_getfile.php?p=xxx&r=yyy&d=zzz>

which will then return the PDF file contents and subsequently delete
the file.

As the deletion is coupled with the download but the download is
initiated by a different request than the one which creates the file,
visiting the link which creates the file and not following the redirect
results in the file not being deleted. These files can then accumulate
and potentially exhaust the available disk space.

Depending on the server setup, space exhaustion of a hard drive or hard
drive partition or even just a disk quota can result in denial of
service even for unrelated services on the same machine which rely on
the same resource.

This issue was originally reported on the plugin's bug tracker [2] but
never identified as a vulnerability.

Exploit
-------
Repeatedly visit a PDF generation link the plugin provides without ever
following the redirect to exhaust disk space.

```
[CVE-2019-1010257] PDF file download path is constructed from
insufficiently sanitised user input
```

=================================================================================================
Type:
-----
Information Disclosure / File Deletion

Description:
------------
When visiting the PDF download link which the original PDF generation
link redirects to, the file path is constructed from a combination of
fixed strings and the strings provided via the query string of the
download URL. The download URL has the form

<http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/article2pdf/article2pdf_getfile.php?p=xxx&r=yyy&d=zzz>

where xxx is a base64 encoded absolute string, xxx is a short hex hash
and zzz is the base64 encoded URL title slug of the post the PDF was
generated from. While the plugin attempts to sanitise these input
parameters to not allow path traversal, this sanitisation is
insufficient and can be fully or partially circumvented depending on
the PHP version the Wordpress instance is running on.

In the case of PHP version <5.3 it is possible to read any file the
user the plugin is executed under has read access to by just encoding
the full file path in the parameter "d" and terminating that string
with a null-byte. The parameter "p" must not be empty but can contain
any value. The parameter "r" may be empty but its value is of no
significance. If the user that the script is executed as has write
access to the file or the directory it is stored in, the file will be
deleted after it has been downloaded. If the user has no write access,
an error message may be shown at the end of the file contents
offered which discloses the Wordpress instance's install directory on
the server.

In the case of PHP version >=5.3, null-termination will no longer cut
off the string. As the generated file name ends with a fixed string
".pdf", only files with that file ending can be read. The parameter "d"
may be any directory on the server. The parameter "p" needs to contain
8 backspace characters to delete a prepended fixed string from the file
name while the parameter "r" must contain exactly one backspace. The
actual file name (without the ".pdf") can then be appended to the
backspaces in either parameter "p" or parameter "r". It is also
possible to have "p" contain one random character and then have 10
backspace characters followed by the actual file name (again,
without the ".pdf") stored in parameter "r".

```
The information above can also be found on the plug-in's issue tracker
[3].
```

Exploit:
--------
On PHP <5.3, a specially crafted link like

<http://php52.example.com/wp-content/plugins/article2pdf/article2pdf_getfile.php?p=YQ==&r=&d=L2V0Yy9wYXNzd2QA>

will download the server's /etc/passwd file.

On PHP >=5.3, a specially crafted link like

<http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/article2pdf/article2pdf_getfile.php?p=CAgICAgICAg=&r=%08test&d=L3RtcA==>

will return the contents of the file "/tmp/test.pdf" and delete the
file if the user the script is executed as has permissions to do so.

The link used above can be generated using a few lines of PHP:

    <?php
    $d52 = base64_encode("/etc/passwd\0");
    $p52 = base64_encode("a");
    $r52 = "";

```
 echo
"<http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/article2pdf/article2pdf_getfile.php?p=${p52}&r=${r52}&d=${d52}\n">;;
```

    $d53 = base64_encode("/tmp");
    $p53_raw = "";
    for ($i=0;$i<8; $i++) $p53_raw .= chr(8);
    $p53 = base64_encode($p53_raw);
    $r53 = "%08test";

```
 echo
"<http://www.example.com/wp-content/plugins/article2pdf/article2pdf_getfile.php?p=${p53}&r=${r53}&d=${d53}\n">;;

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

```
