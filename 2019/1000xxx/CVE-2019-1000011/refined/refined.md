The provided content relates to CVE-2019-1000011.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the resource class when handling GraphQL mutations. Specifically, the system allows passing IRIs (Internationalized Resource Identifiers) belonging to different resource classes than expected during a mutation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The main weakness is the absence of a check to ensure that the resource class of the IRI provided in a mutation matches the expected resource class for the operation. This allows for bypassing access control mechanisms.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to delete or modify resources that they don't have explicit permissions to access. By providing a valid IRI from a different resource class, an attacker could circumvent the access controls in place for the intended resource class.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through GraphQL mutations, by providing an IRI of a different resource than expected.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to make GraphQL mutation requests to the API. They must also have knowledge of valid IRIs for different resources that they do not have access to.
