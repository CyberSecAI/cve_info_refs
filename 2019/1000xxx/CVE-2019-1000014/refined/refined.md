The provided content is a GitHub pull request discussion and doesn't directly relate to a specific CVE. However, it does highlight a potential bug fix and subsequent regression related to error handling in the `rebar3` project.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The pull request aimed to update `hex_core` and add a `mirror_of` repository configuration.
*   A change in `src/rebar_packages.erl` was introduced that modified how 403 responses from the package repository were handled. Specifically, the code was changed to no longer match on an empty body in a 403 response ` {ok, {403, _Headers, <<>>}} ->` and instead matches on any body `{ok, {403, _Headers, _}} ->`.
*   This change accidentally removed a specific warning message that was previously displayed when a package update failed from the `hexpm` repository. This was a regression introduced by the PR.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Regression bug:** The primary issue is the introduction of a regression bug that removed a warning message, making it harder for users to diagnose package update failures. This is not a security vulnerability but a functional one. The underlying issue was an overly broad catch-all for 403 errors.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   The regression bug caused a less informative user experience, specifically when packages failed to update from a repository.  Users would not see the "Failed to update package from repo hexpm" error message which was intended. This makes debugging dependency issues harder.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Not applicable, as this is not a security vulnerability that can be actively exploited.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Not applicable. This is a functional bug that resulted from code changes. There are no attacker capabilities required to "exploit" this regression.
