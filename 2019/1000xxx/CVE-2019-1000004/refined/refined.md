{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied data from the database before rendering it in the sidebar and table data.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could store malicious HTML/JavaScript code in the database, which would be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected parts of the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker injects malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the database via an input field that later renders in the sidebar or table_data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to insert data into the database. They could be a malicious user, or have compromised another account."
