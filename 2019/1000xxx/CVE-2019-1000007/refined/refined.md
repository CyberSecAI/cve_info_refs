CVE-2019-1000007
```

The content is related to CVE-2019-1000007. Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Depth counting error in the `guard()` function within the `aioxmpp` library's XML stream parser.

*   **Root Cause:** The `guard()` function, responsible for managing the depth of XML elements, incorrectly counts the depth under specific error conditions:

    *   When an error occurs inside the first "start" event where `guard()` is used, it fails to properly "swallow" the corresponding "end" event.
    *   After an error, if further elements appear in the stream before the guarded element is closed, `guard()` fails to account for the "start" events of these elements. This leads to the depth counter becoming out-of-sync with the actual XML tree structure.

*   **Weakness:** Incorrect depth counting leading to the possibility of XML injection.

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted XML stream to a vulnerable `aioxmpp` client.

*   **Prerequisites:**
    *   The application must be using a suppressing `xso_error_handler`.
    *   Specific XSO definitions are required for the vulnerability to be exploitable. An example is provided in the GitHub pull request.

*   **Exploitation:** An attacker can send a specially crafted XML stanza that causes the `guard()` function's depth counter to become desynchronized. This can lead to the following:

    *   Making elements appear higher up in the XML stream tree than they actually are.
    *   Injecting arbitrary XML elements into the stream, potentially including `<message>` stanzas with arbitrary senders, allowing for remote message injection.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting malformed XML, the attacker can break the XML stream, disrupting communication.
    *   **Data Injection:** More sophisticated attacks can lead to the injection of arbitrary XML elements, potentially allowing the attacker to inject malicious content or commands into the application.

*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Upgrade to `aioxmpp` version 0.10.3 or later, where the issue is resolved.
    *   Avoid using error-suppressing `xso_error_handlers`. Not using `xso_error_handlers` or not using the suppression function mitigates the vulnerability.
