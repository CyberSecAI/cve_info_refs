## Description

![@nmeum](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2326560?u=ae33fc546193fdf0b7a25ae12df675e067e9882f&v=4&size=48)[nmeum](https://github.com/nmeum)opened [on Jan 9, 2019](https://github.com/RIOT-OS/RIOT/issues/10739#issue-397443273)
## Description

`gnrc_sock_dns` doesn't perform sufficient sanity checks on the DNS response it receives from the configured DNS server.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of issues:

1. The `QDCOUNT` contained in the DNS response is not verified. This causes an out-of-bounds buffer access in the `_skip_hostname` function if `QDCOUNT` is set to a value larger than the buf `len` supplied to `_parse_dns_reply`.
2. The `RDLENGTH` bounds-check for the answer section is incorrect for two reasons: (a) `buf + len` is the first invalid address, so `>=` needs to be used as a comparison operator (b) The result of `bufpos + addrlen` might cause a pointer overflow (especially due to the fact that `addrlen` is attacker controlled). If pointer overflows wrap around (undefined behaviour) this would allow an attacker to circumvent the bounds-check and exposes a buffer overflow vulnerability since the attacker controlled `addrlen` is later used in `memcpy(addr_out, bufpos, addrlen)`, potentially allowing a code execution.
3. The size of the caller allocated buffer `addr_out` is not passed to the `_parse_dns_reply` function at all. This makes checking whether the attacker controlled address actually fits in the buffer impossible and allows an easy buffer overflow and potential code execution.

All of these are especially critical due to the fact that DNS responses can easily be spoofed, especially since all spoofing protection mechanisms of DNS were not implemented. So an attacker doesn't even need to control the configured DNS server in order to exploit this.

## Steps to reproduce the issue

1. Flash an unmodified version of `tests/gnrc_sock_dns` to your RIOT node.
2. Adjust your radvd.conf on your border router and add a RDNSS definition.

### Causing a crash

Constantly send a DNS response with an excessive qdcount on the computer associated with the IP-Address you configured in the radvd RDNSS definition. For example

```
while sleep 1; do
    echo AACEAwkmAAAAAAAAKioqKioqKioqKioqKioqKioqKio= | \
        base64 -d | \
        socat fd:0 udp6-sendto:'[address-of-riot-node]':49152,sourceport=53
done
```
### Remote code execution

This is (obviously) highly platform specific. We did this with `BOARD=pba-d-01-kw2x`. We wrote some ARM assembler code which toggles the LED and stored the machine code for it in the `RDATA` field of the answer section in the DNS response, thereby overflowing the `addr` buffer in the `main` stack frame. Our payload exactly fits into the stack frame of the main function and overwrites the return address of that function, jumping to the `addr` buffer and executing our payload.
