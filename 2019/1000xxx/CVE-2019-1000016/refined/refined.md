{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from an incorrect handling of Variable Length Codes (UVLC) in the cbs_av1 codec within FFmpeg. The specification allows a value of 2^32-1 to be encoded with a variable number of leading zeroes (more than 31) followed by a one, which the code previously failed to process correctly.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of UVLC codes with a large number of leading zeroes.",
      "Buffer overflow in trace code, where the array containing the string representation of bits could overflow if there were more than 63 zeroes."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact was a potential crash or incorrect parsing due to the buffer overflow when tracing bitstream syntax. The code would not properly parse UVLC codes with a large number of leading zeroes, potentially leading to incorrect decoding or other unexpected behaviors.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious AV1 bitstream with overlong UVLC codes, triggering the vulnerability when processed by FFmpeg. This would involve encoding a large value using a very long sequence of leading zeroes followed by a one in the bitstream.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious AV1 bitstream to a system that processes it using a vulnerable version of FFmpeg, or be able to control the media source."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The commit message states the issue is likely due to a specification error, though the code was modified to handle the edge case in the same way as libaom."
