The provided text discusses a design flaw in TeamPass related to shared password security. Here's a breakdown:

*   **Vulnerability:** If an attacker gains access to the TeamPass interface bypassing authentication, they might be able to view shared secrets without needing user passwords. Also, if the attacker bypasses the role security mechanism, they might be able to access shared secrets that they are not normally allowed to see.
*   **Root Cause:** The encryption key for shared passwords is split between a file and the database. Teampass doesn't use user passwords to encrypt or decrypt shared password.
*   **Weakness:** The design relies on the separation of the key components (file and database). If both are compromised, decryption is possible.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker with access to both the database dump and the TeamPass files could decipher every shared password in the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** Bypassing authentication to the TeamPass interface or gaining access to the server with both the webserver and the database.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to bypass authentication, access to the file system where TeamPass is installed, and access to the database.

This information may be relevant to CVE-2019-1000001 if the CVE relates to authentication bypass or shared password security flaws in TeamPass.
