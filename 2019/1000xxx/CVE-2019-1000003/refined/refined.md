Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The MapSVG Lite WordPress plugin uses REST requests to modify post data but fails to validate the nonce. This lack of nonce verification allows Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of nonce verification for REST requests used to modify post data within the plugin.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator without their knowledge.
*   This specific proof of concept shows the ability to modify a page title and inject arbitrary javascript, leading to potential further compromises. An attacker could modify other data managed by the plugin or perform other actions within the plugin.
*   The provided CVSS score indicates a medium severity, with partial impacts to confidentiality and integrity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, meaning that an attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
*   The attack is carried out by crafting a malicious HTML page that initiates a POST request to the vulnerable admin-ajax.php endpoint when a logged-in administrator visits it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in WordPress administrator to visit a malicious HTML page.
*   The attacker doesn't need any prior authentication to the WordPress site, but they must target an already authenticated user.

**Additional notes:**

*   The provided proof-of-concept demonstrates how an attacker can modify a page's title and inject Javascript, which can lead to further attacks such as XSS or account takeovers.
*   The advisory mentions the vulnerability was discovered in April 2018 but the advisory was not published until January 2019 with a CVE requested at that time.
*   The advisory recommends disabling the plugin until a fix is released.
