## [phpMyAdmin 4.9.2 is released](/news/2019/11/22/phpmyadmin-492-released/)

2019-11-22

Welcome to phpMyAdmin 4.9.2, a bugfix release that also contains a security fix.

This security fix is part of an ongoing effort to improve the security of the Designer feature and is designated PMASA-2019-5.
There is also an improvement for how we sanitize Git version information shown on the home page, thanks to Ali Hubail.

This release includes fixes for many bugs, including:

* Fixes for the "Failed to set session cookie" error which relates to the cookie name. In some cases, data stored in the cookie (such as the previously-used user account) may not be loaded from a previous phpMyAdmin cookie the first time you run version 4.9.2
* Fix for Advisor with MySQL 8.0.3 and newer
* Fix PHP deprecation errors
* Fix a situation where exporting users after a delete query could remove users
* Fix incorrect "You do not have privileges to manipulate with the users!" warning
* Fix copying a database's privileges and several other problems moving columns with MariaDB
* Fix for phpMyAdmin not selecting all the values when using shift-click to select during Export

There are many, many more bug fixes thanks to the efforts of our developers and other contributors.

CVE ID         : CVE-2019-19617 CVE-2020-26934 CVE-2020-26935
Debian Bug     : 971999 972000

Several vulnerabilities were found in package phpmyadmin.

CVE-2019-19617

    phpMyAdmin does not escape certain Git information, related to
    libraries/classes/Display/GitRevision.php and libraries/classes
    /Footer.php.

CVE-2020-26934

    A vulnerability was discovered where an attacker can cause an XSS
    attack through the transformation feature.

    If an attacker sends a crafted link to the victim with the malicious
    JavaScript, when the victim clicks on the link, the JavaScript will run
    and complete the instructions made by the attacker.

CVE-2020-26935

    An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in how phpMyAdmin
    processes SQL statements in the search feature. An attacker could use
    this flaw to inject malicious SQL in to a query.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.6.6-4+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
