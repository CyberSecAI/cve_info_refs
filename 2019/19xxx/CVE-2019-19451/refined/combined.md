# CVE-2019-19451

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19450.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19462.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19451 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19451)

#### Description

When GNOME Dia before 2019-11-27 is launched with a filename argument that is not a valid codepoint in the current encoding, it enters an endless loop, thus endlessly writing text to stdout. If this launch is from a thumbnailer service, this output will usually be written to disk via the system's logging facility (potentially with elevated privileges), thus filling up the disk and eventually rendering the system unusable. (The filename can be for a nonexistent file.) NOTE: this does not affect an upstream release, but affects certain Linux distribution packages with version numbers such as 0.97.3.

# Endless loop on filenames with invalid encoding

When launching Dia with a filename argument that is not a valid codepoint in the current encoding, it enters an endless loop:

```
% dia $'\374'
Filename conversion failed: �
Filename conversion failed: �
Filename conversion failed: �
Filename conversion failed: �
Filename conversion failed: �
…
```

(The file does not need to actually exist.)

This is especially problematic when Dia is invoked by a thumbnail service1: The thumbnailer service (e.g. Tumbler) will usually log all output to syslog, which will very quickly fill up the disk.

Implication: Users with local system access can create an appropriately named file (e.g. `touch $'\374'.dia`), view the parent directory in a graphical file manager, and thus cause the thumbnailer service to fill the disk (outside of any quota restriction they may have), leading to an unusable system.

On a test system, Dia produced up to 32 MiB (1.3 million lines) of error output *per second*.

1: Dia registers `Exec=dia -t png -e %o -s %s %i` as a thumbnailer command in `/usr/share/thumbnailers/dia.thumbnailer`.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 33 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [BINUTILS235](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS235 "Changes/BINUTILS235")
* [CMake to do out-of-source builds](/wiki/Changes/CMake_to_do_out-of-source_builds "Changes/CMake to do out-of-source builds")
* [Aarch64 PointerAuthentication](/wiki/Changes/Aarch64_PointerAuthentication "Changes/Aarch64 PointerAuthentication")
* [Java11](/wiki/Changes/Java11 "Changes/Java11")
* [Sqlite Rpmdb](/wiki/Changes/Sqlite_Rpmdb "Changes/Sqlite Rpmdb")
* [RPM 4.16](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.16 "Changes/RPM-4.16")
* [F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 22nd. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f33
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f33. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f33 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f33
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-27 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

# Use %make\_build and %make\_install macros

## Summary

This change will increase the use of the %make\_build and %make\_install macros in spec files.

## Owner

* Name:  [Tom Stellard](/wiki/User%3ATstellar "User:Tstellar")
* Email: <tstellar@redhat.com>

## Current status

* Targeted release:  [Fedora 33](/wiki/Releases/33 "Releases/33")
* Last updated: 2020-07-17
* FESCo issue: [#2420](https://pagure.io/fesco/issue/2420)
* Tracker bug: [#1858398](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1858398)
* Release notes tracker: [#536](https://pagure.io/fedora-docs/release-notes/issue/536)

## Detailed Description

The goal of this change is to standardize the usage of make in Fedora. All make invocations in spec files that use the  %{\_smp\_mflags} macro will be modified to use the %make\_build macro, and all make invocations that use the install target will be updated to use the %make\_install macro. Any additional arguments to make that are not included in either the %make\_build and %make\_install will be preserved.

All changes will be submitted to dist-git repositories via pull requests. Pull requests will be merged after 1 week if there are no objections or earlier if approved by the package maintainers.

A script will be used to apply the necessary changes to the spec files, and the result will be manually inspected before being merged.

All packages updated by this change request will be rebuilt after the spec file changes are merged.

Some packages already use the %make\_build and %make\_install macros. These packages will be left unchanged.

## Feedback

Feedback from thread on devel list:

* There are concerns that replacing all make invocations with %make\_build, even in cases where there may not be any benefit e.g. for `make html` may cause build failures or make the spec file less readable. An alternative to replacing all make invocations would be only to replace make in `make $BUILD_TARGET`, `make check`, and `make install` with %make\_{build,install}.

As a result of this feedback, the change proposal has been updated to only update `make %{_smp_mflags} ...` and `make install` with the macros.

## Benefit to Fedora

* Standardized spec files.

* This will make it easier to enforce consistent build flag usage across all of Fedora.

## Scope

* Proposal owners: Update spec files and submit pull requests and do new package builds. Optional: Merge pull requests (Proposal Owner would need to request to be added to provenpackagers group)

* Other developers: Package owners may merge pull requests and submit new builds if they want, but this is not required for them. A member of the provenpackagers group will be needed to merge pull requests.

* Release engineering: [#9533](https://pagure.io/releng/issues/9533) (a check of an impact with Release Engineering is needed)

* Policies and guidelines: Package guidelines already specify that packages should use these macros when possible.

* Trademark approval: N/A (not needed for this Change)

## Upgrade/compatibility impact

No impact.

## How To Test

Updated packages will be build tested using the koji-simple-ci test that is automatically run when a new pull request is created.

## User Experience

End-users will not notice any changes.

## Dependencies

No real dependencies, each package can be updated independently.

## Contingency Plan

* Contingency mechanism: None. If not all packages are updated in time, then the work can continue into the next release.
* Contingency deadline: All work will be done in the rawhide branch, and will not be backported into the f33 branch once it is created, so whatever gets done before the branch date will make it into the release.
* Blocks release? No
* Blocks product? No

## Documentation

There will be no documentation updates, since this change is bringing spec files up-to-date with the current packaging guidelines.
