Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Rumpus FTP Web File Manager stores the username in a cookie named "snp" using base64 encoding.
*   The application reflects the username from the "snp" cookie in the username field on the login page (`/Login`).
*   The application does not properly sanitize the username before displaying it on the login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability is a persistent XSS because the malicious payload is stored in a cookie and executed every time the login page is loaded by a victim. The unsanitized cookie value allows the injection of arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the username field that is stored in the "snp" cookie.
*   When a user visits the login page (`/Login`), the attacker's JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Keylogging: Stealing user input such as login credentials.
    *   Unvalidated redirects: Redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    *   Other malicious actions via JavaScript execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reflected XSS (CVE-2019-19368):** An attacker can use a separate reflected XSS vulnerability to inject a malicious payload into the "snp" cookie. This allows to set a malicious "snp" cookie value.
    *   Payload Example: `?!'"><script>document.cookie = "snp=Ij48c3ZnL29ubG9hZD1hbGVydCgwKT41=%3B"</script>`
*   **CSRF (CVE-2019-19664):** An attacker could exploit a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability to inject a malicious "Set-Cookie" header, setting the "snp" cookie with a malicious value.
    *   Payload Example: `Set-Cookie: snp=Ij48c3ZnL29ubG9hZD1hbGVydCgwKT41=`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to either exploit the reflected XSS vulnerability or send a crafted HTTP request containing a malicious `Set-Cookie` header. This does not require being authenticated.
*   The attacker can target any user that visits the login page, as the XSS payload is stored in a persistent cookie.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Rumpus FTP Server version 8.2.9.1 for Windows.
*   The vulnerability is unauthenticated since it affects the login page.
*   The XSS payload is base64 encoded and placed into the `snp` cookie.
*   The vulnerability is described as persistent due to the browser storing the cookie which is then read and executed on every visit to the login page.
