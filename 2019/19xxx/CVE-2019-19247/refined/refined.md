The provided content describes an Elevation of Privilege vulnerability in the Origin Client for PC and Mac (versions 10.5.55.33574 and earlier), identified as EASEC-2019-001 with CVE-2019-19247.

### Vulnerability Details:

- **Vulnerability:** A non-Administrative user could elevate their access to System privileges.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker with valid user credentials logs on to a computer with the vulnerable Origin Client installed. They then install a specially crafted program or execute code that modifies files in the Origin install directories. Finally, they stop and restart the Origin Client.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires valid user credentials with the ability to log on to the computer with the Origin Client installed. Requires the ability to install programs or execute code to modify the Origin install directories.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain elevated access, potentially taking control of the system and performing actions reserved for high-privileged users or system administrators.

### Mitigation:
- Update to Origin Client version 10.5.56.33908 (or greater).
- Enable "Restricted User Mode" from within the Origin Client after updating.
- System administrators can remove local login rights or disable non-administrator accounts to temporarily limit the likelihood of exploitation.
