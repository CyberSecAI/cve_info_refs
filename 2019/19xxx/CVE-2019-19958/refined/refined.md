The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19958.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `StringUtils_createStringFromBuffer` function where the size parameter is a signed integer. When a negative value is provided for the size, it's interpreted as a very large unsigned integer during memory allocation, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer signedness vulnerability
- Heap overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Memory corruption
- Program crash due to segmentation fault

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input with a negative size value.
- Fuzzing

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the size parameter passed to `StringUtils_createStringFromBuffer`.
