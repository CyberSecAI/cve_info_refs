Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-19206 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Root Cause:** The Dolibarr CRM/ERP application accepts any extension file for pictures and does not filter the content of uploaded files. The application uses a blacklist to avoid XSS injections that just filter input plain text, with this method you can “bypass” this protection.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper input validation and sanitization for uploaded files, specifically SVG images. The application does not adequately filter or sanitize the content of SVG files, allowing for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a specially crafted SVG file containing embedded JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to upload files to the Dolibarr application.
*   **Exploitation:**
    1.  Craft a malicious SVG file with embedded JavaScript (example provided in the content).
    2.  Upload the SVG file through any file upload input in Dolibarr (e.g., profile picture).
    3.  The XSS payload is triggered when the image is previewed or accessed directly via its URL.
*   **Affected Versions:** The article mentions version 10.0.3 and earlier versions are vulnerable.
*   **Bypass:** The technique consists in craft a malicious SVG file, since the application accept any extension file for pictures and do not filter the content.
