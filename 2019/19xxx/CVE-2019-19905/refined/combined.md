# CVE-2020-5209

| **Name** | CVE-2020-5209 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In NetHack before 3.6.5, unknown options starting with -de and -i can cause a buffer overflow resulting in a crash or remote code execution/privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects systems that have NetHack installed suid/sgid and shared systems that allow users to influence command line options. Users should upgrade to NetHack 3.6.5. |

Hi,

a new version of NetHack has been released that fixes a privilege
escalation issue introduced in 3.6.0 [0] [1]:

As the Debian packages ship setgid binaries, I think they are affected by it.

At least these two commits look related:

# CVE-2020-5210

| **Name** | CVE-2020-5210 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | In NetHack before 3.6.5, an invalid argument to the -w command line option can cause a buffer overflow resulting in a crash or remote code execution/privilege escalation. This vulnerability affects systems that have NetHack installed suid/sgid and shared systems that allow users to influence command line options. Users should upgrade to NetHack 3.6.5. |
| **Source** | [CVE](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2020-5210) (at [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-5210); [CERT](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/byid?searchview=&query=CVE-2020-5210), [LWN](https://lwn.net/Search/DoSearch?words=CVE-2020-5210), [oss-sec](https://marc.info/?l=oss-security&s=CVE-2020-5210), [fulldisc](https://marc.info/?l=full-disclosure&s=CVE-2020-5210), [Red Hat](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-5210), [Ubuntu](https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2020-5210), [Gentoo](https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-5210), SUSE [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-5210)/[CVE](https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-5210/), GitHub [advisories](https://github.com/advisories?query=CVE-2020-5210)/[code](https://github.com/search?type=Code&q=%22CVE-2020-5210%22)/[issues](https://github.com/search?type=Issues&q=%22CVE-2020-5210%22), [web search](https://duckduckgo.com/html?q=%22CVE-2020-5210%22), [more](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/vendors)) |
