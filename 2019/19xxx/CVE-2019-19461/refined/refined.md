The provided content contains information about CVE-2019-19461.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a post-authentication stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability exists because the application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a password entry.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
An authenticated user can steal other users' passwords when a shared password entry is visited.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. Then, by crafting a malicious payload within the password entry's name, the attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the compromised password entry.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs a valid user account to log into the application.
