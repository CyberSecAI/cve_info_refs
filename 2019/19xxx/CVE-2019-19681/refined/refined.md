Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19681:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Pandora FMS application allows authenticated users to define and execute arbitrary commands through its alert system. Specifically, the application doesn't properly restrict the content of commands, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unrestricted command execution:** The system accepts any string as a command, without input sanitization or validation.
- **Insecure default configuration:** The default configuration of the alert system is vulnerable by allowing creation of commands via the web interface.
- **Insufficient access control:** While the vendor attempted to limit command creation to certain user profiles, the core issue of unrestricted command execution persists.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Pandora FMS, potentially gaining full control of the system.
- **Privilege escalation:** By chaining the alert feature with another vulnerability (XSS), even low level users can achieve remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Web application interface:** Attackers exploit the web interface to create malicious commands.
- **Alert system:** The vulnerability is triggered through the alert system by manually triggering an alert or through other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the Pandora FMS system (initially with admin permissions, later it was shown that even a low-level user can trigger it by chaining vulnerabilities).
- **Access to alert configuration:** The attacker needs to have access to the alert configuration features of the system via the web interface.

**Additional details from the content:**

- The vendor initially disputed the vulnerability, arguing that it was a feature and not a bug and that the firewall should provide sufficient protection.
- The researcher explains why the firewall doesn't solve this issue, since the malicious commands can be stored in the database and executed by the system regardless of the firewall.
- The researcher later discovered that a lower-level user could also exploit this vulnerability by combining it with an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-19968).
- Technical details and a JavaScript payload were provided to demonstrate the exploit. The JavaScript payload automates the process of creating malicious commands and triggering them.
