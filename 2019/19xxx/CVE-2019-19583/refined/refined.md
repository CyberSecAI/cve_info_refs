  "cveId": "CVE-2019-19583",
  "description": "A vulnerability was found in all versions of Xen where HVM/PVH guest userspace code may be able to crash the guest, resulting in a guest Denial of Service.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "The VMX VMEntry checks do not handle the specific combination of state where #DB (debug exception) is intercepted, Single Stepping is active, and the code is blocked by STI/MovSS. This leads to a VMEntry failure, which is fatal to the guest.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of debug exceptions and blocked states during VMEntry in VMX."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious HVM/PVH guest user can crash the guest, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered through specific actions within HVM/PVH guest userspace code that leads to the problematic VMEntry state."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code inside a HVM/PVH guest.",
    "affectedSystems": [
      "All versions of Xen",
      "Systems using VMX hardware virtual extensions (Intel, Cyrix, or Zhaoxin CPUs)",
      "HVM/PVH guests. PV guests are not affected."
    ],
     "mitigations": [
        "Running only PV guests avoids this vulnerability.",
        "Running HVM guests on only AMD hardware will also avoid this vulnerability."
