{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize the file name of uploaded files before rendering it in the UI.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the victim views the file attachment section, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can inject malicious code by crafting a specially named file with an XSS payload in the file name. This file is then attached to an email message.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send an email to the victim, and also control the file name of the attached file.",
     "additional_info": "The vulnerability is self-XSS, meaning it can only affect the user who uploads the malicious file, not other users."
