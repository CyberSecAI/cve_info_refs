SSA-593272: SegmentSmack in Interniche IP-Stack based Industrial
Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2020-04-14

V2.3

SUMMARY

A vulnerability exists in affected products that could allow remote attackers to affect the availability of the
devices under certain conditions.

The underlying TCP stack can be forced to make very computation expensive calls for every incoming
packet which can lead to a Denial-of-Service.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the
latest versions. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products
where fixes are not, or not yet available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Development/Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO are used to develop compact or modular PROFINET field
devices.

PN/MF coupler is used to connect an EtherNet/IP network to a PROFINET subnet or to interconnect two
PROFINET subnets.

PN/PN coupler is used for connecting two PROFINET networks.

SIDOOR is an automatic door management system that offers diverse application options and benefits in
elevator, industrial and railway applications.

SIMATIC ET 200 Interface modules for PROFINET IO are used to connect field devices (IO Devices) to
controllers (IO Controller) via PROFINET.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-593272: SegmentSmack in Interniche IP-Stack based Industrial Devices

| Publication Date: | 2020-04-14 |
| --- | --- |
| Last Update: | 2025-01-14 |
| Current Version: | V2.3 |
| CVSS v3.1 Base Score: | 7.5 |

SUMMARY

A vulnerability exists in affected products that could allow remote attackers to affect the availability of the devices under certain conditions.

The underlying TCP stack can be forced to make very computation expensive calls for every incoming packet which can lead to a Denial-of-Service.

Siemens has released new versions for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions. Siemens is preparing further fix versions and recommends countermeasures for products where fixes are not, or not yet available.
