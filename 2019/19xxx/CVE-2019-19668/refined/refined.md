Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) issue found in the "File Types" component of the Rumpus FTP Web File Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The application doesn't properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.
- Lack of CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., tokens) on the `/RAPR/TriggerServerFunction.html` endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate or control the file type settings on the Rumpus FTP server.
- This could lead to the addition of malicious file types or the deletion of critical ones, potentially causing a denial of service or other security issues on the FTP server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious request targeting the `/RAPR/TriggerServerFunction.html` endpoint.
- This malicious request is then sent to a victim user's browser, typically through a social engineering tactic or a malicious webpage.
- If the victim user is logged into the Rumpus FTP Web File Manager, the browser will send the request with the user's credentials, resulting in the unauthorized manipulation of file type settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any special access to the Rumpus FTP server, but they need to trick an authenticated user into sending a crafted HTTP request.
- The attacker needs to know the structure of the request parameters for the `/RAPR/TriggerServerFunction.html` endpoint to modify the file type settings.
- The attacker needs the victim user to have an active session on the Rumpus FTP Web File Manager.
