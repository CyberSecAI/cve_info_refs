```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The apmib library stores device administration and other passwords in plaintext in memory. Additionally, during initialization, the apmib library dumps the entire memory contents to the /web/config.dat file.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Passwords stored in plaintext in memory.
- Memory contents, including passwords, dumped to a publicly accessible file.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can retrieve plaintext passwords, potentially gaining administrative access to the device.

Attack vectors:
- Accessing the /web/config.dat file via HTTP.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to access the router's web interface, either through the local network or if WAN administration is enabled.
