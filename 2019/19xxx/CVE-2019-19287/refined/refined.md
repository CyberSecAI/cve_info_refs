- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface of XHQ Operations Intelligence allows attackers to traverse through the file system of the server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Relative Path Traversal (CWE-23). The application does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input when constructing file paths.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to access sensitive files and information on the server's file system.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted network packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the XHQ server, and requires a low level of privilege (PR:L). No user interaction is required (UI:N).
