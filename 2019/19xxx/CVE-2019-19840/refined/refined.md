{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `zap` executable due to insufficient bounds checking when parsing the `-D` argument.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/tools/_cmdstat.jsp` page, an attacker can pass a long string as the `-D` argument to the `zap` executable, overflowing the stack and achieving arbitrary code execution.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request without authentication to the web interface, which allows triggering the vulnerable code in the zap executable."
