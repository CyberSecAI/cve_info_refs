- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `MngInfoDiscardObject` function in `coders/png.c`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-use-after-free. The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability can lead to program crashes, potentially arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** By processing a specially crafted MNG file, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious MNG file to ImageMagick for processing. This could be done via a web service, email attachment, or any other means where ImageMagick processes user-supplied input.
