- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The streaming service of SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server does not properly validate pathnames, allowing for path traversal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can access and download arbitrary files from the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack via the streaming service (default port 5410/tcp).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No authentication is required. The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.
