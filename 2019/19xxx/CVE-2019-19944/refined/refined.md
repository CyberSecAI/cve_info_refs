- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The function `BerDecoder_decodeUint32` in `src/mms/asn1/ber_decode.c` does not validate input arguments `intLen` and `bufPos`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of input validation in `BerDecoder_decodeUint32` allows for out-of-bounds memory access, potentially leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability exists because the code uses `intLen` and `bufPos` without checking if `bufPos + i` is within the bounds of `buffer`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV), crashing the application.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing crafted input with large values for `intLen` and/or `bufPos`, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send malicious data to the vulnerable application, specifically crafting a payload with manipulated `intLen` and `bufPos`.
