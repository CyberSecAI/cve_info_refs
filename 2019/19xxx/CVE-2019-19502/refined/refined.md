Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is due to insecure handling of user-provided input when setting the upload path in the `pluginconfig.php` file. The plugin uses PHP string interpolation with double quotes, which allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary PHP code by exploiting the curly brace syntax for variable expansion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Code Injection:** The primary vulnerability is code injection through PHP string interpolation.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** While the code uses `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`, it is insufficient to prevent the injection of malicious PHP code. Specifically it does not prevent the use of `${}` curly brace syntax.
- **Use of Double-Quoted Strings:** The use of double-quoted strings in PHP, which are parsed for variable expansion, makes this injection possible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server. This can lead to:
    - Full compromise of the web server.
    - Data breaches.
    - Malware deployment.
    - Denial of Service.
- The provided PoC demonstrates the execution of the `phpinfo()` function, showcasing the ability to run arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST request:** Attackers send a POST request to the settings page of the plugin, with the malicious PHP code injected into the "newpath" parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** An attacker must be an authenticated user to access the settings page and modify the upload path, unless authentication has been disabled by the developer/administrator.
- **Web Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web server where the vulnerable plugin is installed.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code snippet in `pluginconfig.php` where the user defined path is appended to the `pluginconfig.php` file:
```php
if(isset($_POST["newpath"])){
    $newpath = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'newpath', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
    $root = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
    $data = '
        $useruploadfolder = "'.$newpath.'";
        $useruploadpath = $usersiteroot."$useruploadfolder/";
        $foldershistory[] = "'.$newpath.'";
        '.PHP_EOL;
    $fp = fopen( __DIR__. '/pluginconfig.php', 'a');
    fwrite($fp, $data);
}
```
- The vulnerability arises when a user sets the upload path to a string containing `${phpinfo()}` or similar malicious code. PHP will execute the function due to string interpolation with double quotes.
- The fix involves changing the double quotes to single quotes in the affected part of the code in `pluginconfig.php`.
```php
$useruploadfolder = \''.$newpath.'\';
$foldershistory[] = \''.$newpath.'\';
```
- The single quotes prevent PHP from parsing the contents as an expression.
