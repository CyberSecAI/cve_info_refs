# CVE-2019-19502

Remote code execution in Image Uploader and Browser for CKEditor 4.1.8 and earlier.

![CVE-2019-19502](/static/img/NK2_tygdrT-640.jpeg "CVE-2019-19502")
## CVE

[CVE-2019-19502](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19502)

## Vendor and Product

[Image Uploader and Browser for CKEditor](https://imagebrowser.maleck.org/)

## Versions Affected

4.1.8 and earlier.

## Risk and Severity Rating

CVSS Base Score: 8.8 (High)
CVSS Vector String: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H&version=3.0)

## Vulnerability

Image Uploader and Browser for CKEditor 4.1.8 and earlier suffers from code injection vulnerability via PHP string interpolation. This allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code which can lead to remote code execution.

Authentication as a user is required to exploit this vulnerability. However, in some cases, authentication is not required as protection [can be disabled](https://imagebrowser.maleck.org/disable_pw.html) by developer/administrator.

### Technical Details

This plugin stores settings, such as upload path, into `pluginconfig.php`. It already sanitized the path using `FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING`. You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/xsmo/Image-Uploader-and-Browser-for-CKEditor/blob/944cb41297ed928489002a936fc9819ed4820fc0/pluginconfig.php#L27-L35).

```
if(isset($_POST["newpath"])){
    $newpath = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'newpath', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);
    $root = $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'];
    $data = '
        $useruploadfolder = "'.$newpath.'";
        $useruploadpath = $usersiteroot."$useruploadfolder/";
        $foldershistory[] = "'.$newpath.'";
        '.PHP_EOL;
    $fp = fopen( __DIR__. '/pluginconfig.php', 'a');
    fwrite($fp, $data);
}
```

However, the upload path is stored into a PHP variable named `$useruploadfolder` and appended into `$folderhistory` with double quotes. In PHP, double-quoted strings [will be parsed](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.parsing). For example:

```
<?php

$name = "Visat";
echo "Hi my name is $name";

?>
```

Running above code in PHP will output `Hi my name is Visat`. Moreover, PHP has a feature named [complex (curly) syntax](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.parsing.complex). Basically it allows more complex expressions such as accessing object property.

```
<?php

$name = "Visat";
echo "Hi my name is {$name}";
echo "Hi my name is ${name}"; // variation

class Person { public $name = "Visat" }

$person = new Person();
echo "Hi my name is {$person->name}";

?>
```

Another interesting thing is this curly syntax can be used to call a function.

```
<?php

$func = "phpinfo";
$info = "{$func()}"; // this will output PHP info

?>
```

This feature can be abused to achieve remote code execution in this plugin. If a user saves the upload path using curly syntax which calls a function inside the syntax, the function will be called.

## Proof of Concept

Login to Image Uploader and Browser for CKEditor 4.8.1 and earlier, then set the upload path to `${phpinfo()}` on the settings page. Refresh the page and PHP info will be printed.

![Proof of Concept](/static/img/UD-reuBgNO-640.jpeg "Proof of Concept")

Proof of concept by calling `phpinfo()`.

The `phpinfo` function then can be replaced by other PHP functions to achieve remote code execution on the server.

## Solution

Upgrade to Image Uploader and Browser for CKEditor 4.1.9 or later [here](https://github.com/xsmo/Image-Uploader-and-Browser-for-CKEditor/releases).

* Secure: Only you can access the image browser by a **password protection** since version 4.0.
* Flexible: Do you already have your own upload folder? You can easily **switch and create folders** in the image browser.
* Modern UI: The Image Browser is **responsive** and looks great on every device width.
* Support: **Regular updates** and an always up to date **documentation** make it easy for you to install and use the browser.
