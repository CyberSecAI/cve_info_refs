Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-19458:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue found in the "Data Export" and "Database Export" functionalities of the SALTO ProAccess SPACE software.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The software allows users to specify a filename for exports. By manipulating this filename with special characters (e.g., `..\`), an attacker can traverse outside the designated export path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Access:** An attacker can use the path traversal to access and download files from outside the web application's root directory, such as database backups.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The webserver runs as SYSTEM by default, which combined with other vulnerabilities such as arbitrary file write allows for arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker manipulates the filename parameter during export operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the SALTO ProAccess SPACE application to access the export functionalities.
