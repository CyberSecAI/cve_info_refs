The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2019-19702.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's XML parser allows external entity expansion, which enables XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The core vulnerability is the ability to inject and execute malicious XML entities. This is due to the XML parser not being configured to disable external entity expansion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Local file disclosure:** An attacker can read local files from the server, potentially exposing sensitive information like passwords and user data.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** By using `file://dev/random`, an attacker can cause the import process to hang, leading to a DoS.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Sending numerous DMARC reports with the malicious payload can cause the server to run out of memory. This can lead to the web application becoming unresponsive or even crashing the hosting server.
*   **Mail Queue Saturation:** By sending many crafted reports to the RUA email, legitimate reports can be delayed or dropped.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Malicious DMARC reports:** Attackers can send crafted DMARC reports via email to the addresses listed in the RUA attribute of the DNS records.
*   **XML payload in the report:** The vulnerability is exploited by including a malicious XML payload within the DMARC report. This payload uses external entities to perform actions like reading local files or creating a DoS condition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote since the attack vector is through emails sent to the DMARC RUA address.
*  **Ability to send emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails with malicious XML payloads to the RUA addresses.

**Additional Notes**
*   The issue was found in the `modoboa-dmarc` component of the Modoboa application.
