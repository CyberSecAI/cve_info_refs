Debian Bug     : 949863 968623 971058

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, privilege escalation,
denial of service or information leaks.

CVE-2019-19039

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    assertion failure (WARN).  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash) if the panic_on_warn kernel parameter is set.

CVE-2019-19377

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to a
    use-after-free.  A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary
    filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19770

    The syzbot tool discovered a race condition in the block I/O
    tracer (blktrace) that could lead to a system crash.  Since
    blktrace can only be controlled by privileged users, the security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19816

    "Team bobfuzzer" reported a bug in Btrfs that could lead to an
    out-of-bounds write.  A user permitted to mount and access
    arbitrary filesystems could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-0423

    A race condition was discovered in the Android binder driver, that
    could result in a use-after-free.  On systems using this driver, a
    local user could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-8694

    Multiple researchers discovered that the powercap subsystem
    allowed all users to read CPU energy meters, by default.  On
    systems using Intel CPUs, this provided a side channel that could
    leak sensitive information between user processes, or from the
    kernel to user processes.  The energy meters are now readable only
    by root, by default.

    This issue can be mitigated by running:

        chmod go-r /sys/devices/virtual/powercap/*/*/energy_uj

    This needs to be repeated each time the system is booted with
    an unfixed kernel version.

CVE-2020-14351

    A race condition was discovered in the performance events
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    permitted to access performance events could use this to cause a
    denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25656

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability could use this
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25668

    Yuan Ming and Bodong Zhao discovered a race condition in the
    virtual terminal (vt) driver that could lead to a use-after-free.
    A local user with access to a virtual terminal, or with the
    CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG capability, could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2020-25669

    Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Sun keyboard driver (sunkbd)
    that could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system using this
    driver, a local user could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2020-25704

    kiyin(尹亮) discovered a potential memory leak in the performance
    events subsystem.  A local user permitted to access performance
    events could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

    Debian's kernel configuration does not allow unprivileged users to
    access peformance events by default, which fully mitigates this
    issue.

CVE-2020-25705

    Keyu Man reported that strict rate-limiting of ICMP packet
    transmission provided a side-channel that could help networked
    attackers to carry out packet spoofing.  In particular, this made
    it practical for off-path networked attackers to "poison" DNS
    caches with spoofed responses ("SAD DNS" attack).

    This issue has been mitigated by randomising whether packets are
    counted against the rate limit.

CVE-2020-27673 / XSA-332

    Julien Grall from Arm discovered a bug in the Xen event handling
    code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged (domU)
    guests could cause a denial of service (excessive CPU usage or
    hang) in dom0.

CVE-2020-27675 / XSA-331

    Jinoh Kang of Theori discovered a race condition in the Xen event
    handling code.  Where Linux was used in a Xen dom0, unprivileged
    (domU) guests could cause a denial of service (crash) in dom0.

CVE-2020-28941

    Shisong Qin and Bodong Zhao discovered a bug in the Speakup screen
    reader subsystem.  Speakup assumed that it would only be bound to
    one terminal (tty) device at a time, but did not enforce this.  A
    local user could exploit this bug to cause a denial of service
    (crash or memory exhaustion).

CVE-2020-28974

    Yuan Ming discovered a bug in the virtual terminal (vt) driver
    that could lead to an out-of-bounds read.  A local user with
    access to a virtual terminal, or with the CAP_SYS_TTY_CONFIG
    capability, could possibly use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel or to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

    The specific ioctl operation affected by this bug
    (KD_FONT_OP_COPY) has been disabled, as it is not believed that
    any programs depended on it.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.160-2~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/linux-4.19>

# CVE-2019-3701

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-3700.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-3773.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-3701 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-3701)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in can\_can\_gw\_rcv in net/can/gw.c in the Linux kernel through 4.19.13. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical operations that can be also applied to the can\_dlc field. The privileged user "root" with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule that makes the data length code a higher value than the available CAN frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g. cgw\_csum\_xor\_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag\_list pointer in skb\_shared\_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames.

Subject: [[RFC 0/3] block: address blktrace use-after-free](#r)
Date: Wed,  1 Apr 2020 23:59:59 +0000	[[thread overview]](#r)
Message-ID: <20200402000002.7442-1-mcgrof@kernel.org> (<raw>)

Upstream kernel.org korg#205713 contends that there is a UAF in
the core debugfs debugfs_remove() function, and has gone through
pushing for a CVE for this, CVE-2019-19770.

If correct then parent dentries are not positive, and this would
have implications far beyond this bug report. Thankfully, upon review
with Nicolai, he wasn't buying it. His suspicions that this was just
a blktrace issue were spot on, and this patch series demonstrates
that, provides a reproducer, and provides a solution to the issue.

We there would like to contend CVE-2019-19770 as invalid. The
implications suggested are not correct, and this issue is only
triggerable with root, by shooting yourself on the foot by misuing
blktrace.

If you want this on a git tree, you can get it from linux-next
20200401-blktrace-fix-uaf branch [2].

Wider review, testing, and rants are appreciated.

# CVE-2019-19770

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19769.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19783.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19770 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19770)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* In the Linux kernel 4.19.83, there is a use-after-free (read) in the debugfs\_remove function in fs/debugfs/inode.c (which is used to remove a file or directory in debugfs that was previously created with a call to another debugfs function such as debugfs\_create\_file). NOTE: Linux kernel developers dispute this issue as not being an issue with debugfs, instead this is an issue with misuse of debugfs within blktrace.

Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves 7 vulnerabilities and has 76 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2020-11669: An issue was discovered on the powerpc platform.
arch/powerpc/kernel/idle\_book3s.S did not have save/restore
functionality for PNV\_POWERSAVE\_AMR, PNV\_POWERSAVE\_UAMOR, and
PNV\_POWERSAVE\_AMOR, aka CID-53a712bae5dd (bnc#1169390).
- CVE-2020-8834: KVM on Power8 processors had a conflicting use of
HSTATE\_HOST\_R1 to store r1 state in kvmppc\_hv\_entry plus in
kvmppc\_{save,restore}\_tm, leading to a stack corruption. Because of
this, an attacker with the ability run code in kernel space of a guest
VM can cause the host kernel to panic. There were two commits that,
according to the reporter, introduced the vulnerability: f024ee098476
("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pull out TM state save/restore into separate
procedures") 87a11bb6a7f7 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Work around XER[SO] bug
in fake suspend mode") (bnc#1168276).
- CVE-2020-11494: An issue was discovered in slc\_bump in
drivers/net/can/slcan.c, which allowed attackers to read uninitialized
can\_frame data, potentially containing sensitive information from kernel
stack memory, if the configuration lacks CONFIG\_INIT\_STACK\_ALL, aka
CID-b9258a2cece4 (bnc#1168424).
- CVE-2019-9458: In the video driver there is a use after free due to a
race condition. This could lead to local escalation of privilege with no
additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed
for exploitation (bnc#1168295).
- CVE-2019-3701: An issue was discovered in can\_can\_gw\_rcv in
net/can/gw.c. The CAN frame modification rules allow bitwise logical
operations that can be also applied to the can\_dlc field. The privileged
user "root" with CAP\_NET\_ADMIN can create a CAN frame modification rule
that made the data length code a higher value than the available CAN
frame data size. In combination with a configured checksum calculation
where the result is stored relatively to the end of the data (e.g.
cgw\_csum\_xor\_rel) the tail of the skb (e.g. frag\_list pointer in
skb\_shared\_info) can be rewritten which finally can cause a system
crash. Because of a missing check, the CAN drivers may write arbitrary
content beyond the data registers in the CAN controller's I/O memory
when processing can-gw manipulated outgoing frames (bnc#1120386).
- CVE-2020-10942: In get\_raw\_socket in drivers/vhost/net.c lacked
validation of an sk\_family field, which might allow attackers to trigger
kernel stack corruption via crafted system calls (bnc#1167629).
- CVE-2019-19770: A use-after-free in the debugfs\_remove function in
fs/debugfs/inode.c was fixed. (bnc#1159198).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:
- ACPI: watchdog: Fix gas->access\_width usage (bsc#1051510).
- ACPICA: Introduce ACPI\_ACCESS\_BYTE\_WIDTH() macro (bsc#1051510).
- ALSA: ali5451: remove redundant variable capture\_flag (bsc#1051510).
- ALSA: core: Add snd\_device\_get\_state() helper (bsc#1051510).
- ALSA: core: Replace zero-length array with flexible-array member
(bsc#1051510).

However the CVE assigned to this over incorrect by stating the severity of this bug report is in the core kernel degugfs_remove() with an intrinsic use-after-free on the core debugfs code in the kernel. We would like to dispute this CVE. Patches being reviewed upstream and the respective reproducer:  [https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200402000002.7442-1-mcgrof@kernel.org](https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20200402000002.7442-1-mcgrof%40kernel.org)                <https://github.com/mcgrof/break-blktrace> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=205713#c3)  Eric Sandeen    2020-04-15 17:40:29 UTC  ``` I'd also be interested to know if Tristan's original bug was hit while using the loop driver or some oether block device.  Frankly, bugs like this with so little information are very difficult to work with - it's tough to reverse-engineer what may have happened when that information is not provided. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=205713#c4)  Luis Chamberlain    2020-04-21 02:02:45 UTC  ``` To remove clutter from the commit log that will be used, I will provide below a bit of explanation of the crash, and provide a reference to here for those curious of the elaborate details of the analysis.  This will be using a new crash, but he same applies to v4.19.83 where the bug was reported on.

Above we have a case where the upon LOOP_CTL_ADD(loop) #2 the     debugfs_create_dir() start_creating() call will have found an existing dentry,     and return ERR_PTR(-EEXIST), and so the q->debugfs_dir will be initialized to     NULL. This clash happens because an asynchronous __blk_release_queue() has     been scheduled from the above LOOP_CTL_DEL(loop0) #2 call, and it has not yet     removed the old loop0 debugfs directory.          [   13.926433] == blk_mq_debugfs_register(2) q->debugfs_dir created          This is a huge assumption, since we never check for errors on     blk_mq_debugfs_register(), and so the child files we need to     create *can* simply be created using NULL as as the parent, in     which case debugfs would use debugfs_mount->mnt_root as the parent.

So the     files created can actually be created where they should have.          ---> From LOOP_CTL_DEL(loop0) #2     [   13.971046] === blk_trace_cleanup(7) end     [   13.973175] == __blk_trace_remove(7) end     [   13.975352] == blk_trace_shutdown(7) end     [   13.977415] = __blk_release_queue(7) calling blk_mq_debugfs_unregister()     [   13.980645] ==== blk_mq_debugfs_unregister(7) begin     [   13.980696] ==== blk_mq_debugfs_unregister(7) debugfs_remove_recursive(q->debugfs_dir)          This is a continuation from the old scheduled  __blk_release_queue(). It     is using another request_queue structure than what the currently activated     blktrace setup is using.          Here now the dentry where the blktrace setup files were created on top     of is gone.  In fact, since debugfs_remove_recursive() is used, *all* of     those blktrace debugfs files should have been removed as well, including     the relay. This is despite the fact that the removal and blktrace setup     are working on two different request_queue structures.

But recall that we just had     our old device removed, and since debugfs_remove_recursive() was used,     so are all of its files. This request_queue however is still active.

Note the trap though,     the blktrace setup will already have been cleaned up since the     scheduled removal from instance #2 removed the files on the same     debugfs path.          The __blk_release_queue() is scheduled and is asynchronous so can     continue later, and that is where the crash happens, on CPU 2.

There were quite a bit of scattered fixes required for this, if you are looking to backport this to your kernel be sure to include starting from "blktrace: break out of blktrace setup on concurrent calls" up to "blktrace: ensure our debugfs dir exists". The actual fix for this particular crash however is handled by the patch titled, "blktrace: fix debugfs use after free" ``` |  |
