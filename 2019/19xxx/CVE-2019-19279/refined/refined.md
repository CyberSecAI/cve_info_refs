- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation when processing specially crafted packets sent to port 50000/UDP.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-Service (DoS) of the affected device, requiring a manual reboot to recover the service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, by sending specially crafted packets to port 50000/UDP of the EN100 Ethernet communication modules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the affected device's port 50000/UDP. No authentication is required (PR:N).
