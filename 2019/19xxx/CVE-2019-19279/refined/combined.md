SUMMARY

The SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices are affected by a security vulnerability which could
allow an attacker to conduct a Denial-of-Service attack over the network when equipped with EN100
Ethernet communication modules. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures to mitigate the issue.

All versions

See recommendations from section Workarounds
and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• For relays equipped with EN100 Ethernet communication modules having IEC 61850 ﬁrmware
version V4.30 and higher, activate DTLS-secured communication in DIGSI 4 and in the EN100
module, and set a connection password in the EN100 module to permit only authenticated users to
access the relay over the network.

• Limit access to port 50000/UDP.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build
resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPROTEC 4 and SIPROTEC Compact devices provide a wide range of integrated protection, control,
measurement, and automation functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19279

Specially crafted packets sent to port 50000/UDP of the EN100 Ethernet communication modules
could cause a Denial-of-Service of the affected device. A manual reboot is required to recover
the service of the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security
vulnerability was known to Siemens.
