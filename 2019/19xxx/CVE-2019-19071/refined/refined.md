Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-19071:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `rsi_send_beacon()` function within the `drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi_91x_mgmt.c` file of the Linux kernel.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when the `rsi_prepare_beacon()` function fails during the beacon sending process. In this failure case, the allocated memory for the skb (socket buffer) is not released.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak where allocated memory for the skb is not deallocated upon failure in the `rsi_prepare_beacon()` function. This can lead to uncontrolled memory consumption.
- **Improper Resource Management:** Failure to free allocated resources on error conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can repeatedly trigger the `rsi_prepare_beacon` failure by sending crafted packets, thus causing a denial-of-service due to excessive memory consumption. This can lead to system instability and potential crashes.
- **Kernel Memory Exhaustion:** The repeated memory leaks can exhaust kernel memory, preventing other processes or kernel modules from allocating necessary resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs local access to the target system to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Specific Driver:** The vulnerability is specific to the RSI 91x WLAN device driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local access:** Attacker requires the ability to interact with the system, typically through the command line or other local interfaces.
- **Trigger Failure:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger the failure condition in the `rsi_prepare_beacon()` function.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this issue involves releasing the allocated skb memory when `rsi_prepare_beacon` fails. This was implemented by commit `d563131ef23cbc756026f839a82598c8445bc45f`.
- Several sources indicate that this vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker causing an error while sending beacon frames, resulting in a memory leak.
