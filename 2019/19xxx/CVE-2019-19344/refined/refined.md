  "CVE-2019-19344": {
    "description": "There is a use-after-free issue in all samba 4.9.x versions before 4.9.18, all samba 4.10.x versions before 4.10.12 and all samba 4.11.x versions before 4.11.5, essentially due to a call to realloc() while other local variables still point at the original buffer.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free error caused by calling realloc() on a buffer while other local variables still held pointers to the original memory region. This occurs during the processing of dynamically created DNS records that are due to be tombstoned because they reached their expiry time.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially cause a denial-of-service by crashing the affected service or, under unlikely conditions, read memory may be saved back into the database, possibly leading to information disclosure. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker with a low level of privileges can trigger this vulnerability.",
        "notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by an off-by-default feature `dns zone scavenging = yes`."
