The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19259.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) issue. Non-project members were unintentionally allowed to be added to protected environments.

**Weaknesses:**
- Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The system failed to properly validate the user's access rights before allowing them to be added to protected environments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users could be added to protected environments, potentially gaining access to sensitive resources or operations they are not meant to access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating the user ID parameter, a non-project member can be added to a protected environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have knowledge of the project ID and user IDs. They must also have some level of access to the GitLab instance, although they do not need to be a member of the affected project.
