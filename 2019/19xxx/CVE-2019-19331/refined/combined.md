CVE ID         : CVE-2019-10190 CVE-2019-10191 CVE-2019-19331 CVE-2020-12667
Debian Bug     : 932048 946181 961076

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in knot-resolver, a
caching, DNSSEC-validating DNS resolver which may allow remote attackers to
bypass DNSSEC validation or cause a denial-of-service.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.2.1-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your knot-resolver packages.

For the detailed security status of knot-resolver please refer to

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c0)  msiddiqu    2019-12-04 09:36:34 UTC  ``` DNS replies with very many resource records might be processed very inefficiently, in extreme cases taking even several CPU seconds for each such uncached message.  For example, a few thousand A records can be squashed into one DNS message (limit is 64kB).  To execute an attack it is enough to: + own a rogue authoritative server or utilize an existing name with a huge RRset, and + trigger DNS query for that name from the resolver to be attacked  References:   <https://gitlab.labs.nic.cz/knot/knot-resolver/tags/v4.3.0>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c1)  msiddiqu    2019-12-04 09:56:37 UTC  ``` From upstream:  Most of the issue can be mitigated by updating libknot dependency to >= 2.9.1. Otherwise a complete fix will be released in Knot Resolver 4.3.0, which also does not require libknot update. The attached patches are applicable to recent releases (when doc diff is stripped).   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c2)  msiddiqu    2019-12-04 10:00:22 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1641993](attachment.cgi?id=1641993&action=diff "big-rrset.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1641993&action=edit "big-rrset.patch") big-rrset.patch   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c3)  msiddiqu    2019-12-04 10:00:58 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1641994](attachment.cgi?id=1641994&action=diff "cname-limit.patch") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1641994&action=edit "cname-limit.patch") cname-limit.patch   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c4)  msiddiqu    2019-12-06 08:28:32 UTC  ``` Public via:   <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/04/4> <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/119>  Lifting embargo.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c5)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-12-06 09:04:18 UTC  ``` Created knot-resolver tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1780511](show_bug.cgi?id=1780511 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-19331 knot-resolver: DNS packets taking few seconds to process with full CPU utilization leads to DoS [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c6)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-12-06 09:04:51 UTC  ``` Created knot-resolver tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1780513](show_bug.cgi?id=1780513 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-19331 knot-resolver: DNS packets taking few seconds to process with full CPU utilization leads to DoS [epel-7]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1779566#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-12-06 13:04:53 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.
