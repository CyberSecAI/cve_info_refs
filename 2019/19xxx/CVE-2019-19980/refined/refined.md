The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19980.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Email Subscribers & Newsletters plugin allows authenticated users with 'subscriber' level permissions (or higher) to send test emails through the administrative dashboard. This is due to the lack of access control checks in the `send_test_email` AJAX function, which does not verify if the request comes from a user with proper administrative capabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure permissions on the AJAX function `send_test_email`.
- Lack of access control check.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with 'subscriber' level access or higher can send test emails from the site owner's email server. This could potentially be used to send unwanted emails.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted AJAX request to the `send_test_email` function on the `wp-admin` dashboard.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have an authenticated user account with 'subscriber' or higher level permissions on the WordPress site.
- Access to the `wp-admin` dashboard.
