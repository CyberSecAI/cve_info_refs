{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds array read due to incorrect index increment and usage before validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The code increments an index variable, then uses it to access an array element, without first checking if the index is within valid bounds."
    ],
    "impact": "The out-of-bounds read can lead to crashes due to heap-buffer-overflow errors. This could potentially lead to denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Crafting specific Python code with function definitions containing keyword-only arguments or double-star keyword arguments can trigger the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide Python code which is then parsed and compiled. This is a common operation and does not require specific or unusual privileges."

    {
      "file": "Python/ast.c",
      "location": "handle_keywordonly_args() around line 1403",

        "The fixes involve adding checks to ensure that the index 'i' is less than NCH(n) before accessing array elements using CHILD(n, i)."
