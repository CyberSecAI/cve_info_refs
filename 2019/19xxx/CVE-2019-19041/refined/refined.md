Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly verify the integrity of upgrade packages before processing them. Specifically, it does not correctly validate the `files.SUM` file, which is intended to provide integrity checks, allowing modification of the package content.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inadequate Integrity Check:** The application relies on the `files.SUM` file for integrity control, but this mechanism can be bypassed by modifying the values within this file.
    *   **Remote Command Injection:** By manipulating the upgrade package, specifically the `upgrade.sh` file, an attacker can inject arbitrary bash scripts that will be executed by the underlying system.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application, leading to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through the "Tool upgrade" functionality of the `lpar2rrd` and `stor2rrd` applications.
    *   The attacker uploads a modified upgrade package containing a malicious `upgrade.sh` script and a modified `files.SUM` to bypass the integrity check.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have access to the administrative panel of the application.
    *   The attacker must be able to upload a modified upgrade package through the "Tool Upgrade" page.
