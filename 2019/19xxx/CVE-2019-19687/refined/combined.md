As shown anyone who's authenticated can retrieve any credentials including their 'secret'.

This is a rather severe information disclosure vulnerability and completely defies the purpose of TOTP or MFA as these credentials are not kept secure or private whatsoever.

If Auth-rules are configured allow login with only 'topt' it would be extremely easy to assume a different user's identity.

A CVE should be issued for this. I can take care of that paperwork.

Apologies for the IRC disclosure, this was before I realized what I just ran into. I fully suspected the issue within my policy definition and only upon further looking at it and cross-referencing on a different OpenStack platform I understood that this was indeed a Security Issue and not just a config fail.

Should I request a CVE on your behalf? Or is that being tracked by the VulnTeam?

You can request a CVE if you wish, but the VMT usually does so as part of the process[0]. So either way one will get made for this.

If the VMT wants to take it with Mitre I'm more than happy with that. Last time I was involved with Octavia where they didnt had VMT correspondence so I filled out the forms for them.

Nice to be able to lean back for once as a reporter, just kidding ;)

Please do let me know if I can be of any help or assist in any way.

I can apply and test patches against Train/Ubuntu (UCA repo) but sadly not against RHEL because that's running Red Hat OpenStack Platform (support would void).

Agreed with fungi, with the details of this out in IRC, we can treat this as a public report. Looks like we have a patch already as well, so things are moving fairly quickly in terms of getting this fixed.

I wrote up an impact description for use in an upcoming OpenStack Security Advisory and associated CVE request. Please suggest any improvements or suggestions:

Title: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all user's credentials

Reporter: Daniel 'f0o' Preussker ()

Products: Keystone

Affects: >=15.0.0, <=16.0.0

Description:

Daniel 'f0o' Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce\_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with enforce\_scope set to false are affected.

Daniel, is there any organization you want credited along with you for reporting this defect?

Gage, I think the use of "user's" in the title (copied from the report itself) incorrectly suggests that a user only has access to credentials for their own user rather than, as the description explains, for all users in that project. Instead maybe try "Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of project credentials" or something like that? As for the affects line, assuming this problem was only introduced in Stein, you want "==15.0.0, ==16.0.0" (wow, were there really no stable/stein point releases?!?) or alternatively ">=15.0.0 <15.0.1, >=16.0.0 <16.0.1" to accurately reflect that any point releases will contain the fix.

Updated, please review:

Title: Credentials API allows non-admin to list and retrieve every users' credentials

Reporter: Daniel 'f0o' Preussker

Products: Keystone

Affects: ==15.0.0, ==16.0.0

Description:

Daniel 'f0o' Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce\_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with enforce\_scope set to false are affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.

Somewhat of a grammar nit on the updated title, but it would be "every user's" or "all users'" (placement of the apostrophe in possessive nouns is significant for indicating plurality, and "every" modifies a singular noun as opposed to "all" which modifies a plural). This nuance in the English language is why I suggested dodging "users'" or "user's" and picking different, less ambiguous phrasing so as to avoid confusion for non-native readers of English when skimming the advisory title.

Fix credential list for project members

Without this patch, project members and readers can list any credentials

    with the /v3/credentials API when enforce\_scope is false. enforce\_scope

    is only applicable to project admins due to the admin-ness problem[1],

    and this policy is not meant to allow project admins any access to users'

    credentials (only system admins should be able to access them). However,

    when enforce\_scope is false, we need to preserve the old behavior of

    project admins being able to list all credentials. This change mitigates

    the problem by running the identity:get\_credential policy check to

    filter out credentials the user does not have access to. This will

    impact performance.

Just to get confirmation, this bug was only introduced as of Stein, right? It's not present in Rocky or earlier?

Gage, assuming the above is true, and if nobody has any other concerns about your proposed impact description in comment #17, you can probably go ahead and request a CVE assignment for this so we can proceed with the advisory, since the fix has already merged to master and it looks like stable backports are in the process of getting proposed.

I honestly don't know if it's been in Rocky or not. The code change suggests that it got introduced with the system scoping which appeared in Stein as far as I know.

I wasn't able to recreate this with Rocky, only a user with the "admin" role was able to list credentials, other users with member roles were denied (as policy defined).

The code was indeed changed after Rocky to account for system scope, where I believe that this issue was introduced.

Subject: [OSSA-2019-006] Keystone: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all
 users credentials (CVE-2019-19687)

=====================================================================================
OSSA-2019-006: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all users
credentials
=====================================================================================

:Date: December 09, 2019
:CVE: CVE-2019-19687

Affects
~~~~~~~
- Keystone: ==15.0.0, ==16.0.0

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Daniel Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list
credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any
credentials with the /v3/credentials API when [oslo_policy]
enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to
view any other users credentials, which could leak sign-on information
for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments
running keystone with [oslo_policy] enforce_scope set to false are
affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list
credentials API once this issue is fixed.

Patches

- <https://review.opendev.org/697611> (Train)
- <https://review.opendev.org/697355> (Ussuri)

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

As shown anyone who's authenticated can retrieve any credentials including their 'secret'.

This is a rather severe information disclosure vulnerability and completely defies the purpose of TOTP or MFA as these credentials are not kept secure or private whatsoever.

If Auth-rules are configured allow login with only 'topt' it would be extremely easy to assume a different user's identity.

A CVE should be issued for this. I can take care of that paperwork.

Apologies for the IRC disclosure, this was before I realized what I just ran into. I fully suspected the issue within my policy definition and only upon further looking at it and cross-referencing on a different OpenStack platform I understood that this was indeed a Security Issue and not just a config fail.

Should I request a CVE on your behalf? Or is that being tracked by the VulnTeam?

You can request a CVE if you wish, but the VMT usually does so as part of the process[0]. So either way one will get made for this.

If the VMT wants to take it with Mitre I'm more than happy with that. Last time I was involved with Octavia where they didnt had VMT correspondence so I filled out the forms for them.

Nice to be able to lean back for once as a reporter, just kidding ;)

Please do let me know if I can be of any help or assist in any way.

I can apply and test patches against Train/Ubuntu (UCA repo) but sadly not against RHEL because that's running Red Hat OpenStack Platform (support would void).

Agreed with fungi, with the details of this out in IRC, we can treat this as a public report. Looks like we have a patch already as well, so things are moving fairly quickly in terms of getting this fixed.

I wrote up an impact description for use in an upcoming OpenStack Security Advisory and associated CVE request. Please suggest any improvements or suggestions:

Title: Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of all user's credentials

Reporter: Daniel 'f0o' Preussker ()

Products: Keystone

Affects: >=15.0.0, <=16.0.0

Description:

Daniel 'f0o' Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce\_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with enforce\_scope set to false are affected.

Daniel, is there any organization you want credited along with you for reporting this defect?

Gage, I think the use of "user's" in the title (copied from the report itself) incorrectly suggests that a user only has access to credentials for their own user rather than, as the description explains, for all users in that project. Instead maybe try "Credentials API allows listing and retrieving of project credentials" or something like that? As for the affects line, assuming this problem was only introduced in Stein, you want "==15.0.0, ==16.0.0" (wow, were there really no stable/stein point releases?!?) or alternatively ">=15.0.0 <15.0.1, >=16.0.0 <16.0.1" to accurately reflect that any point releases will contain the fix.

Updated, please review:

Title: Credentials API allows non-admin to list and retrieve every users' credentials

Reporter: Daniel 'f0o' Preussker

Products: Keystone

Affects: ==15.0.0, ==16.0.0

Description:

Daniel 'f0o' Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystone's list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce\_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with enforce\_scope set to false are affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.

Somewhat of a grammar nit on the updated title, but it would be "every user's" or "all users'" (placement of the apostrophe in possessive nouns is significant for indicating plurality, and "every" modifies a singular noun as opposed to "all" which modifies a plural). This nuance in the English language is why I suggested dodging "users'" or "user's" and picking different, less ambiguous phrasing so as to avoid confusion for non-native readers of English when skimming the advisory title.

Just to get confirmation, this bug was only introduced as of Stein, right? It's not present in Rocky or earlier?

Gage, assuming the above is true, and if nobody has any other concerns about your proposed impact description in comment #17, you can probably go ahead and request a CVE assignment for this so we can proceed with the advisory, since the fix has already merged to master and it looks like stable backports are in the process of getting proposed.

commit 17947516b0095c51da5cff94771247f2e7c44ee6

Author: Colleen Murphy <email address hidden>

Date: Wed Dec 4 10:51:05 2019 -0800

Fix credential list for project members

Without this patch, project members and readers can list any credentials

    with the /v3/credentials API when enforce\_scope is false. enforce\_scope

    is only applicable to project admins due to the admin-ness problem[1],

    and this policy is not meant to allow project admins any access to users'

    credentials (only system admins should be able to access them). However,

    when enforce\_scope is false, we need to preserve the old behavior of

    project admins being able to list all credentials. This change mitigates

    the problem by running the identity:get\_credential policy check to

    filter out credentials the user does not have access to. This will

    impact performance.

Closes-bug: #1855080

I honestly don't know if it's been in Rocky or not. The code change suggests that it got introduced with the system scoping which appeared in Stein as far as I know.

I wasn't able to recreate this with Rocky, only a user with the "admin" role was able to list credentials, other users with member roles were denied (as policy defined).

The code was indeed changed after Rocky to account for system scope, where I believe that this issue was introduced.

Date:

December 09, 2019

CVE:

CVE-2019-19687

## Affects[Â¶](#affects "Link to this heading")

* Keystone: ==15.0.0, ==16.0.0

## Description[Â¶](#description "Link to this heading")

Daniel Preussker reported a vulnerability in Keystoneâs list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when [oslo\_policy] enforce\_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with [oslo\_policy] enforce\_scope set to false are affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1781470#c0)  Summer Long    2019-12-10 05:22:58 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Keystone's list credentials API. Any user with a role on a project is able to list any credentials with the /v3/credentials API when enforce_scope is false. Users with a role on a project are able to view any other users' credentials, which could leak sign-on information for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTP) or othewise. Deployments running keystone with enforce_scope set to false are affected. There will be a slight performance impact for the list credentials API once this issue is fixed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
