- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of the XHQ Operations Intelligence product is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a user. This is due to a lack of CSRF protection mechanisms.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can trick an unsuspecting user into executing malicious requests, potentially leading to unauthorized actions within the application. This could involve data manipulation, unauthorized access, or other harmful activities. Specifically, the vulnerability could lead to high impact on Confidentiality and Integrity, but no impact on Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to trick a user into accessing a malicious link that contains the forged request. This is typically done by tricking the victim to open a link, open an email or visit a website controlled by the attacker.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, will execute a forged request against the vulnerable application. The attacker doesn't need to authenticate to the application, only to make a victim access the malicious link.
