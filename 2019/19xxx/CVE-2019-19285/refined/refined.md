The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19285.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The web interface of Siemens XHQ Operations Intelligence is vulnerable to injections that could lead to XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session. This could potentially lead to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions on behalf of the compromised user.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking unsuspecting users into accessing a malicious link. This implies a social engineering element where the attacker must induce the user to click a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have low privileges (PR:L) and must be able to craft a malicious link. User interaction (UI:R) is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attack is network-based (AV:N) and has low complexity (AC:L).
