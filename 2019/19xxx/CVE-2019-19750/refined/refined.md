Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the reuse of SSH host keys across multiple instances of the MinerStat mining OS. The SSH host keys were generated prior to disk image creation, leading to identical keys across all systems using the same image.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Shared SSH Host Keys:** Multiple systems have the same SSH host key, which is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Predictable Host Identification:** Attackers can use the shared keys to identify vulnerable systems on the internet using scanners like shodan.io or SSH key scanners.
*   **Impersonation:** An attacker could potentially impersonate a legitimate server if they already control a system with the same key.
*   **Exploitation of Default Credentials:** This vulnerability makes it easier for attackers to correlate public keys with default credentials, because the attacker can identify the exact OS being used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to mining rigs by using the identified keys and default credentials.
*   **System Compromise:** Once inside, attackers can compromise the mining rigs, potentially using them for malicious purposes or stealing cryptocurrency.
*   **Enumeration of Identifiable Hosts:** Attackers can easily create a list of MinerStat systems exposed online by scanning for the known shared key.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Internet Scanning:** Attackers can scan the internet using tools like Shodan to find systems with the compromised SSH host keys.
*   **SSH Access:** Attackers can then attempt to log in to these identified machines using default credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Internet Access:** The attacker needs to have internet access to perform scans using Shodan or similar tools.
*   **SSH Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SSH and how to use it to attempt connections.
*   **Dictionary of Default Credentials:** The attacker benefits greatly from having a dictionary of default credentials associated with the identified SSH keys.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The provided text confirms that the vulnerability was fixed by MinerStat, as indicated by the changelog link.
*   The article also discusses similar issues in other mining OSs.
*   The specific SSH host key for MinerStat is provided within the article, as well as links to shodan.io queries that confirm systems are exposed.
