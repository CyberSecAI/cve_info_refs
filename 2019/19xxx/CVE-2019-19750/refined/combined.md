# [Widespread re-use of SSH Host Keys in Ethereum Mining Rig Operating Systems](../../../../blog/2020/4/10/Widespread_re-use_of_SSH_Host_Keys_in_Ethereum_Mining_Rig_Operating_Systems.html)

#### Written 2020-04-10

#### Tags:[Cryptocurrency](../../../../blog/tags/Cryptocurrency.html)Â [Ethereum](../../../../blog/tags/Ethereum.html)Â [Crypto](../../../../blog/tags/Crypto.html)Â [SSH](../../../../blog/tags/SSH.html)

[prev](../../../../blog/2020/3/20/JSON_and_KML_now_available_for_OpMap.html) [next](../../../../blog/2020/7/3/Installing_Debian_10_on_a_PowerMac_G5.html)
## How this started

A friend came to me last fall wondering how their newly set up mining rig kept getting rooted. This
happened over a few different mining OSs. Eventually we found an old firewall rule allowing inbound
SSH access, and the mining rig had lost the DHCP lottery and SSH was exposed. Rather than close the
hole immediately we decided to do some logging. We set up a new, fresh install and waited. Mostly,
we got the usual SSH scanners hitting the box, but rarely our attacker would log in with the right
default password on the first try. That's strange - default passwords change per mining OS, so how
would they know what OS was running?

I myself have a GPU rig, for machine learning and other purposes. But while it's idle to me, it mines.
Strangely, I noticed that the SSH host-keys on my box predated the software installation,
which made me curious who generated them.

With these two bits of knowledge, I discovered a widespread key-reusage bug, worked with the mining OS
groups, and filed several CVEs.

## What exactly are SSH host keys?

SSH host keys provide a mechanism so that a server can be fingerprinted and identified to a client as a trusted
entity, worthy of being fed a password through a login attempt. In other words:

[![SshHostKeyPrompt](https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48772448413_042c5867e3_o.png)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/40925843%40N03/48772448413/in/dateposted-public/ "SshHostKeyPrompt")

The SSH key should be unique per host, both to prevent a bad actor compromising one machine being able to impersonate
another, and to prevent a bad actor from enumerating identifiable hosts by looking for known public keys.

## The Problem

Several Linux-based Ethereum mining platforms constructed host-keys prior to disk image generation. This means that
a large number of systems share the SSH host keys. In addition to being able to impersonate servers, we can search
shodan.io or use an SSH host-public-key scanner to identify hosts accessible on the public IPv4 space. It also means
that it is fairly easy to construct a dictionary mapping public key to default credentials for some mining OSs.

## The Extraction Process

For each mining image, the disk image was downloaded, and testdisk was run to extract the SSH keys. Testdisk had trouble with
a few images, so the remaining ones were booting in a VM. SSH keys were then
searched on shodan.io to confirm the presence of IPv4 exposes hosts.

## Conclusions

It seems attackers have weaponized SSH host keys, both as a means of identifying hosts,
and identifying default exploits like unchanged default usernames and passwords. Additionally,
most appliances or IoT devices should not be exposed on IPv4/6 for ingress from the general internet.
This sentiment was echoed by some mining OS vendors who did not recognize shared host keys as an
issue until presented with results showing their miners were easily identifiable online. Finally,
a secure automatic update path is a must - without this miners will remain exposed until manually
patched, likely with many miners unaware they are exposed.

## Responsible Disclosure

An effort was made to contact the authors of each identified OS, and publication was delayed four months in an effort to allow vendors to patch their distributions:
