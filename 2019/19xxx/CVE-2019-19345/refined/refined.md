[CVE-2019-19345]

- Vulnerability: Insecure modification vulnerability in the /etc/passwd file.
- Affected Component: openshift/mediawiki-apb container.
- Root Cause: The container modifies the permissions of /etc/passwd to make it modifiable by users other than root.
- Attack Vector: An attacker with access to the running container.
- Impact: An attacker can modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges within the container.
- Mitigation: The vulnerability is not exploitable in unprivileged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform by default because the system calls SETUID and SETGID are blocked by the default seccomp policy.
- Fix: This issue has been addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2, 4.1 and 3.11 via RHSA-2020:0617, RHSA-2020:0694 and RHSA-2020:0798 respectively.
