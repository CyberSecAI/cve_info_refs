|  | Platform: Windows 10 version 1903 |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | Class: Privilege Escalation |
|  |  |
|  | Product: CatalystProductionSuite.2019.1.exe |
|  | Version: 1.1.0.21 |
|  |  |
|  | Product: CatalystBrowseSuite.2019.1.exe |
|  | Version: 1.1.0.21 |
|  |  |
|  | Summary: |
|  | A weak malicious user can escalate its privilege whenever CatalystProductionSuite.2019.1.exe and CatalystBrowseSuite.2019.1.exe installers run. |
|  | The vulnerability is in the form of DLL Hijacking. |
|  | The installers try to load DLLs that don’t exist from its current directory; |
|  | Both installers try to load a dll named “NETUTILS.dll”. by doing so, an attacker can quickly escalate its privileges. |
|  |  |
|  | Additional missing DLL List: |
|  | 1. MSIMG32.dll |
|  | 2. VERSION.dll |
|  | 3. WINMM.dll |
|  | 4. WININET.dll |
|  | 5. WTSAPI32.dll |
|  | 6. MSVFW32.dll |
|  | 7. WINMMBASE.dll |
|  | 8. winnlsres.dll |
|  | 9. RichEd20.dll |
|  | 10. USP10.dll |
|  | 11. msls31.dll |
|  | 12. imageres.dll |
|  | 13. srpapi.dll |
|  | 14. MsiMsg.dll |
|  | 15. WKSCLI.dll |
|  |  |
|  | Steps to reproduce: |
|  | 1. Use DLL proxy to OS DLLs. |
|  | 2. Place the malicious dll in the current directory of the installers |
|  | 3. Finally, the installers try to load DLLs from the current directory like NETUTILS.dll for CatalystProductionSuite.2019.1.exe and CatalystBrowseSuite.2019.1.exe and many more dlls that could also be hijacked. |
|  |  |
|  | Impact: |
|  | 1. Privilege Escalation |
|  | 2. DoS |
|  |  |
|  | Mitigation: |
|  | - Don’t load DLLs from the current directory |

Hello Mr Eli-Paz,

I tried to replicate vulnerability on exact same version you have mentioned, i was able to spawn Shell but it is of same privileges as of user executing installer file.

please let me know if i am missing any step

Sorry, something went wrong.
