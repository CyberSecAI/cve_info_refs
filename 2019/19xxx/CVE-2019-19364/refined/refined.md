{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The installers for CatalystProductionSuite.2019.1.exe and CatalystBrowseSuite.2019.1.exe attempt to load DLLs from their current directory, including 'NETUTILS.dll', and several other missing DLLs.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "DLL Hijacking vulnerability. The installers load DLLs from an insecure location (current directory) without proper validation or full path specification. ",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Privilege Escalation, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution with elevated privileges. Denial of Service (DoS) could also be achieved.",
  "Attack vectors": "Placing a malicious DLL (e.g., NETUTILS.dll) in the same directory as the installer.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL file in the same directory where the installer is executed. They also need to be able to execute the vulnerable installer."
