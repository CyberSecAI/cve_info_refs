- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when processing data during the import process. Specifically the "Import" -> "Data import wizard" feature, allows the injection of client-side scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can redirect users to malicious websites, steal session tokens, and conduct phishing attacks using malicious JavaScript.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the "Import" -> "Data import wizard" feature, where a malicious user can inject scripts via uploaded or imported data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the Jama Connect application with the ability to use the data import wizard feature.
