Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19386:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `app/voicemail_greetings/voicemail_greeting_edit.php` file of FusionPBX version 4.5.10. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input provided through the `id` parameter.

**Weaknesses:**
- Improper input validation and sanitization for the `id` parameter.
- The application does not encode output, allowing malicious script to be executed in a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.
- This injected script could potentially perform actions such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious site
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL including the vulnerable `id` parameter.
- The attacker would need to convince a user to click the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with the malicious payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious link to a user of the application.

**Additional Details:**
The provided proof of concept URL is:

```
https://domain/app/voicemail_greetings/voicemail_greeting_edit.php?id=123%27%3E%3Csvg/onload=alert(document.domain)%3E%3Ca%20href=%27
```

This injects a javascript payload that, when executed in the browser, will display an alert box containing the document domain. This shows a successful XSS injection.

The fix for this vulnerability is located in the following commit:
<https://github.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx/commit/9e837fadecdd5199819a949b5b1bd84b19f716f2>

The commit diff shows a change where urlencode() was added when calling the voicemail_greetings.php, which might fix the XSS issue.
`echo " <input type='button' class='btn' name='' alt='".$text['button-back']."' onclick=\"window.location='voicemail_greetings.php?id=".urlencode($voicemail_id)."'\" value='".$text['button-back']."'>";`
