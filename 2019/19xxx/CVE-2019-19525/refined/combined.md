Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005
    media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19037

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not
    correctly handle directories with holes (unallocated regions) in
    them.  An attacker able to mount arbitrary ext4 volumes could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

libnvdimm: prevent nvdimm from requesting key when security is disabled
[ Upstream commit 674f31a352da5e9f621f757b9a89262f486533a0 ]
Current implementation attempts to request keys from the keyring even when
security is not enabled. Change behavior so when security is disabled it
will skip key request.
Error messages seen when no keys are installed and libnvdimm is loaded:
request-key[4598]: Cannot find command to construct key 661489677
request-key[4606]: Cannot find command to construct key 34713726

As reported by erofs-utils fuzzer, currently, multiref
(ondisk deduplication) hasn't been supported for now,
we should forbid it properly.

commit ee45197c807895e156b2be0abcaebdfc116487c8 upstream.
As reported by erofs\_utils fuzzer, a logical page can belong
to at most 2 compressed clusters, if one compressed cluster
is corrupted, but the other has been ready in submitting chain.
The chain needs to submit anyway in order to keep the page
working properly (page unlocked with PG\_error set, PG\_uptodate
not set).

staging: erofs: fix an error handling in erofs\_readdir()
commit acb383f1dcb4f1e79b66d4be3a0b6f519a957b0d upstream.
Richard observed a forever loop of erofs\_read\_raw\_page() [1]
which can be generated by forcely setting ->u.i\_blkaddr
to 0xdeadbeef (as my understanding block layer can
handle access beyond end of device correctly).
After digging into that, it seems the problem is highly
related with directories and then I found the root cause
is an improper error handling in erofs\_readdir().
Let's fix it now.

of disabling the unit (section 7.3.77 of ARM IHI 0064D).
Synchronization is also recommended after programming the trace
registers to ensure all updates are committed prior to normal code
resuming (section 4.3.7 of ARM IHI 0064D).
Let's ensure these syncronization points are present in the code
and clearly commented.
Note that we could rely on the barriers in CS\_LOCK and
coresight\_disclaim\_device\_unlocked or the context switch to user
space - however coresight may be of use in the kernel.
On armv8 the mb macro is defined as dsb(sy) - Given that the etm4x is
only used on armv8 let's directly use dsb(sy) instead of mb(). This
removes some ambiguity and makes it easier to correlate the code with
the TRM.

vfs: Fix EOVERFLOW testing in put\_compat\_statfs64
commit cc3a7bfe62b947b423fcb2cfe89fcba92bf48fa3 upstream.
Today, put\_compat\_statfs64() disallows nearly any field value over
2^32 if f\_bsize is only 32 bits, but that makes no sense.
compat\_statfs64 is there for the explicit purpose of providing 64-bit
fields for f\_files, f\_ffree, etc. And f\_bsize is always only 32 bits.
As a result, 32-bit userspace gets -EOVERFLOW for i.e. large file
counts even with -D\_FILE\_OFFSET\_BITS=64 set.
In reality, only f\_bsize and f\_frsize can legitimately overflow
(fields like f\_type and f\_namelen should never be large), so test
only those fields.
This bug was discussed at length some time ago, and this is the proposal
Al suggested at https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/8/6/640. It seemed to get
dropped amid the discussion of other related changes, but this
part seems obviously correct on its own, so I've picked it up and
sent it, for expediency.

riscv: Avoid interrupts being erroneously enabled in handle\_exception()
[ Upstream commit c82dd6d078a2bb29d41eda032bb96d05699a524d ]
When the handle\_exception function addresses an exception, the interrupts
will be unconditionally enabled after finishing the context save. However,
It may erroneously enable the interrupts if the interrupts are disabled
before entering the handle\_exception.
For example, one of the WARN\_ON() condition is satisfied in the scheduling
where the interrupt is disabled and rq.lock is locked. The WARN\_ON will
trigger a break exception and the handle\_exception function will enable the
interrupts before entering do\_trap\_break function. During the procedure, if
a timer interrupt is pending, it will be taken when interrupts are enabled.
In this case, it may cause a deadlock problem if the rq.lock is locked
again in the timer ISR.
Hence, the handle\_exception() can only enable interrupts when the state of
sstatus.SPIE is 1.
This patch is tested on HiFive Unleashed board.

The wrong values will be shown for the first interval on the second and

prev\_raw\_counts is allocated when using intervals. This is used when
calculating the difference in the counts of events when using interval.
The current counts are stored in prev\_raw\_counts to calculate the
differences in the next iteration.
On the first interval of the second and subsequent repetitions,
prev\_raw\_counts would be the values stored in the last interval of the
previous repetitions, while the current counts will only be for the
first interval of the current repetition.
Hence there is a possibility of events showing up as big number.
Fix this by resetting prev\_raw\_counts whenever perf stat repeats the
command.

tick: broadcast-hrtimer: Fix a race in bc\_set\_next
[ Upstream commit b9023b91dd020ad7e093baa5122b6968c48cc9e0 ]
When a cpu requests broadcasting, before starting the tick broadcast
hrtimer, bc\_set\_next() checks if the timer callback (bc\_handler) is active
using hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel(). But hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel() does not provide
the required synchronization when the callback is active on other core.
The callback could have already executed tick\_handle\_oneshot\_broadcast()
and could have also returned. But still there is a small time window where
the hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel() returns -1. In that case bc\_set\_next() returns
without doing anything, but the next\_event of the tick broadcast clock
device is already set to a timeout value.
In the race condition diagram below, CPU #1 is running the timer callback
and CPU #2 is entering idle state and so calls bc\_set\_next().
In the worst case, the next\_event will contain an expiry time, but the
hrtimer will not be started which happens when the racing callback returns
HRTIMER\_NORESTART. The hrtimer might never recover if all further requests
from the CPUs to subscribe to tick broadcast have timeout greater than the
next\_event of tick broadcast clock device. This leads to cascading of
failures and finally noticed as rcu stall warnings
Here is a depiction of the race condition
CPU #1 (Running timer callback) CPU #2 (Enter idle
and subscribe to
tick broadcast)
--------------------- ---------------------
\_\_run\_hrtimer() tick\_broadcast\_enter()
bc\_handler() \_\_tick\_broadcast\_oneshot\_control()
tick\_handle\_oneshot\_broadcast()
raw\_spin\_lock(&tick\_broadcast\_lock);
dev->next\_event = KTIME\_MAX; //wait for tick\_broadcast\_lock
//next\_event for tick broadcast clock
set to KTIME\_MAX since no other cores
subscribed to tick broadcasting
raw\_spin\_unlock(&tick\_broadcast\_lock);
if (dev->next\_event == KTIME\_MAX)
return HRTIMER\_NORESTART
// callback function exits without
restarting the hrtimer //tick\_broadcast\_lock acquired
raw\_spin\_lock(&tick\_broadcast\_lock);
tick\_broadcast\_set\_event()
clockevents\_program\_event()
dev->next\_event = expires;
bc\_set\_next()
hrtimer\_try\_to\_cancel()
//returns -1 since the timer
callback is active. Exits without
restarting the timer
cpu\_base->running = NULL;
The comment that hrtimer cannot be armed from within the callback is
wrong. It is fine to start the hrtimer from within the callback. Also it is
safe to start the hrtimer from the enter/exit idle code while the broadcast
handler is active. The enter/exit idle code and the broadcast handler are
synchronized using tick\_broadcast\_lock. So there is no need for the
existing try to cancel logic. All this can be removed which will eliminate
the race condition as well.

KVM: nVMX: Fix consistency check on injected exception error code

Current versions of Intel's SDM incorrectly state that "bits 31:15 of

31:16 must be zero, i.e. error codes are 16-bit values.
The bogus error code check manifests as an unexpected VM-Entry failure
due to an invalid code field (error number 7) in L1, e.g. when injecting
a #GP with error\_code=0x9f00.
Nadav previously reported the bug[\*], both to KVM and Intel, and fixed
the associated kvm-unit-test.

Btrfs: fix selftests failure due to uninitialized i\_mode in test inodes
[ Upstream commit 9f7fec0ba89108b9385f1b9fb167861224912a4a ]
Some of the self tests create a test inode, setup some extents and then do
calls to btrfs\_get\_extent() to test that the corresponding extent maps
exist and are correct. However btrfs\_get\_extent(), since the 5.2 merge
window, now errors out when it finds a regular or prealloc extent for an
inode that does not correspond to a regular file (its ->i\_mode is not
S\_IFREG). This causes the self tests to fail sometimes, specially when
KASAN, slub\_debug and page poisoning are enabled:
$ modprobe btrfs

This happens because the test inodes are created without ever initializing
the i\_mode field of the inode, and neither VFS's new\_inode() nor the btrfs
callback btrfs\_alloc\_inode() initialize the i\_mode. Initialization of the
i\_mode is done through the various callbacks used by the VFS to create
new inodes (regular files, directories, symlinks, tmpfiles, etc), which
all call btrfs\_new\_inode() which in turn calls inode\_init\_owner(), which
sets the inode's i\_mode. Since the tests only uses new\_inode() to create
the test inodes, the i\_mode was never initialized.
This always happens on a VM I used with kasan, slub\_debug and many other
debug facilities enabled. It also happened to someone who reported this
on bugzilla (on a 5.3-rc).
Fix this by setting i\_mode to S\_IFREG at btrfs\_new\_test\_inode().

blk-mq: move lockdep\_assert\_held() into elevator\_exit
[ Upstream commit 284b94be1925dbe035ce5218d8b5c197321262c7 ]
Commit c48dac137a62 ("block: don't hold q->sysfs\_lock in elevator\_init\_mq")
removes q->sysfs\_lock from elevator\_init\_mq(), but forgot to deal with
lockdep\_assert\_held() called in blk\_mq\_sched\_free\_requests() which is
run in failure path of elevator\_init\_mq().
blk\_mq\_sched\_free\_requests() is called in the following 3 functions:
elevator\_init\_mq()
elevator\_exit()
blk\_cleanup\_queue()
In blk\_cleanup\_queue(), blk\_mq\_sched\_free\_requests() is followed exactly
by 'mutex\_lock(&q->sysfs\_lock)'.
So moving the lockdep\_assert\_held() from blk\_mq\_sched\_free\_requests()
into elevator\_exit() for fixing the report by syzbot.

selftests/bpf: adjust strobemeta loop to satisfy latest clang
[ Upstream commit 4670d68b9254710fdeaf794cad54d8b2c9929e0a ]
Some recent changes in latest Clang started causing the following
warning when unrolling strobemeta test case main loop:
progs/strobemeta.h:416:2: warning: loop not unrolled: the optimizer was
unable to perform the requested transformation; the transformation might
be disabled or specified as part of an unsupported transformation
ordering [-Wpass-failed=transform-warning]
This patch simplifies loop's exit condition to depend only on constant
max iteration number (STROBE\_MAX\_MAP\_ENTRIES), while moving early
termination logic inside the loop body. The changes are equivalent from
program logic standpoint, but fixes the warning. It also appears to
improve generated BPF code, as it fixes previously failing non-unrolled
strobemeta test cases.

\_\_set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr() will choose an active dest\_cpu in affinity mask to
migrage the process if process is not currently running on any one of the
CPUs specified in affinity mask. \_\_set\_cpus\_allowed\_ptr() will choose an
invalid dest\_cpu (dest\_cpu >= nr\_cpu\_ids, 1024 in my virtual machine) if
CPUS in an affinity mask are deactived by cpu\_down after cpumask\_intersects
check. cpumask\_test\_cpu() of dest\_cpu afterwards is overflown and may pass if
corresponding bit is coincidentally set. As a consequence, kernel will
access an invalid rq address associate with the invalid CPU in
migration\_cpu\_stop->\_\_migrate\_task->move\_queued\_task and the Oops occurs.
The reproduce the crash:
1) A process repeatedly binds itself to cpu0 and cpu1 in turn by calling
sched\_setaffinity.
2) A shell script repeatedly does "echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online"
and "echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu1/online" in turn.
3) Oops appears if the invalid CPU is set in memory after tested cpumask.

iommu/amd: Fix downgrading default page-sizes in alloc\_pte()
[ Upstream commit 6ccb72f8374e17d60b58a7bfd5570496332c54e2 ]
Downgrading an existing large mapping to a mapping using smaller
page-sizes works only for the mappings created with page-mode 7 (i.e.
non-default page size).
Treat large mappings created with page-mode 0 (i.e. default page size)
like a non-present mapping and allow to overwrite it in alloc\_pte().
While around, make sure that we flush the TLB only if we change an
existing mapping, otherwise we might end up acting on garbage PTEs.

thermal\_hwmon: Sanitize thermal\_zone type
[ Upstream commit 8c7aa184281c01fc26f319059efb94725012921d ]
When calling thermal\_add\_hwmon\_sysfs(), the device type is sanitized by
replacing '-' with '\_'. However tz->type remains unsanitized. Thus
calling thermal\_hwmon\_lookup\_by\_type() returns no device. And if there is
no device, thermal\_remove\_hwmon\_sysfs() fails with "hwmon device lookup
failed!".
The result is unregisted hwmon devices in the sysfs.

thermal: Fix use-after-free when unregistering thermal zone device
[ Upstream commit 1851799e1d2978f68eea5d9dff322e121dcf59c1 ]
thermal\_zone\_device\_unregister() cancels the delayed work that polls the
thermal zone, but it does not wait for it to finish. This is racy with
respect to the freeing of the thermal zone device, which can result in a
use-after-free [1].
Fix this by waiting for the delayed work to finish before freeing the
thermal zone device. Note that thermal\_zone\_device\_set\_polling() is
never invoked from an atomic context, so it is safe to call
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync() that can block.

ntb: point to right memory window index
[ Upstream commit ae89339b08f3fe02457ec9edd512ddc3d246d0f8 ]
second parameter of ntb\_peer\_mw\_get\_addr is pointing to wrong memory
window index by passing "peer gidx" instead of "local gidx".
For ex, "local gidx" value is '0' and "peer gidx" value is '1', then
on peer side ntb\_mw\_set\_trans() api is used as below with gidx pointing to
local side gidx which is '0', so memroy window '0' is chosen and XLAT '0'
will be programmed by peer side.
ntb\_mw\_set\_trans(perf->ntb, peer->pidx, peer->gidx, peer->inbuf\_xlat,
peer->inbuf\_size);
Now, on local side ntb\_peer\_mw\_get\_addr() is been used as below with gidx
pointing to "peer gidx" which is '1', so pointing to memory window '1'
instead of memory window '0'.
ntb\_peer\_mw\_get\_addr(perf->ntb, peer->gidx, &phys\_addr,
&peer->outbuf\_size);
So this patch pass "local gidx" as parameter to ntb\_peer\_mw\_get\_addr().

pwm: stm32-lp: Add check in case requested period cannot be achieved
[ Upstream commit c91e3234c6035baf5a79763cb4fcd5d23ce75c2b ]
LPTimer can use a 32KHz clock for counting. It depends on clock tree
configuration. In such a case, PWM output frequency range is limited.
Although unlikely, nothing prevents user from requesting a PWM frequency
above counting clock (32KHz for instance):
- This causes (prd - 1) = 0xffff to be written in ARR register later in
the apply() routine.
This results in badly configured PWM period (and also duty\_cycle).
Add a check to report an error is such a case.

drm/amdgpu: Check for valid number of registers to read

Do not try to allocate any amount of memory requested by the user.
Instead limit it to 128 registers. Actually the longest series of
consecutive allowed registers are 48, mmGB\_TILE\_MODE0-31 and
mmGB\_MACROTILE\_MODE0-15 (0x2644-0x2673).

netfilter: nf\_tables: allow lookups in dynamic sets
[ Upstream commit acab713177377d9e0889c46bac7ff0cfb9a90c4d ]
This un-breaks lookups in sets that have the 'dynamic' flag set.
Given this active example configuration:
table filter {
set set1 {
type ipv4\_addr
size 64
flags dynamic,timeout
timeout 1m
}
chain input {
type filter hook input priority 0; policy accept;
}
}
... this works:
nft add rule ip filter input add @set1 { ip saddr }
-> whenever rule is triggered, the source ip address is inserted
into the set (if it did not exist).
This won't work:
nft add rule ip filter input ip saddr @set1 counter
Error: Could not process rule: Operation not supported
In other words, we can add entries to the set, but then can't make
matching decision based on that set.
That is just wrong -- all set backends support lookups (else they would
not be very useful).
The failure comes from an explicit rejection in nft\_lookup.c.
Looking at the history, it seems like NFT\_SET\_EVAL used to mean
'set contains expressions' (aka. "is a meter"), for instance something like
nft add rule ip filter input meter example { ip saddr limit rate 10/second }
or
nft add rule ip filter input meter example { ip saddr counter }
The actual meaning of NFT\_SET\_EVAL however, is
'set can be updated from the packet path'.
'meters' and packet-path insertions into sets, such as
'add @set { ip saddr }' use exactly the same kernel code (nft\_dynset.c)
and thus require a set backend that provides the ->update() function.
The only set that provides this also is the only one that has the
NFT\_SET\_EVAL feature flag.
Removing the wrong check makes the above example work.
While at it, also fix the flag check during set instantiation to
allow supported combinations only.

ceph: fix directories inode i\_blkbits initialization
[ Upstream commit 750670341a24cb714e624e0fd7da30900ad93752 ]
When filling an inode with info from the MDS, i\_blkbits is being
initialized using fl\_stripe\_unit, which contains the stripe unit in
bytes. Unfortunately, this doesn't make sense for directories as they
have fl\_stripe\_unit set to '0'. This means that i\_blkbits will be set
to 0xff, causing an UBSAN undefined behaviour in i\_blocksize():
UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in ./include/linux/fs.h:731:12

fuse: fix request limit
[ Upstream commit f22f812d5ce75a18b56073a7a63862e6ea764070 ]
The size of struct fuse\_req was reduced from 392B to 144B on a non-debug
config, thus the sanitize\_global\_limit() helper was setting a larger
default limit. This doesn't really reflect reduction in the memory used by
requests, since the fields removed from fuse\_req were added to fuse\_args
derived structs; e.g. sizeof(struct fuse\_writepages\_args) is 248B, thus
resulting in slightly more memory being used for writepage requests
overalll (due to using 256B slabs).
Make the calculatation ignore the size of fuse\_req and use the old 392B
value.

xen/pci: reserve MCFG areas earlier
[ Upstream commit a4098bc6eed5e31e0391bcc068e61804c98138df ]
If MCFG area is not reserved in E820, Xen by default will defer its usage
until Dom0 registers it explicitly after ACPI parser recognizes it as
a reserved resource in DSDT. Having it reserved in E820 is not
mandatory according to "PCI Firmware Specification, rev 3.2" (par. 4.1.2)
and firmware is free to keep a hole in E820 in that place. Xen doesn't know
what exactly is inside this hole since it lacks full ACPI view of the
platform therefore it's potentially harmful to access MCFG region
without additional checks as some machines are known to provide
inconsistent information on the size of the region.
Now xen\_mcfg\_late() runs after acpi\_init() which is too late as some basic
PCI enumeration starts exactly there as well. Trying to register a device
prior to MCFG reservation causes multiple problems with PCIe extended
capability initializations in Xen (e.g. SR-IOV VF BAR sizing). There are
no convenient hooks for us to subscribe to so register MCFG areas earlier
upon the first invocation of xen\_add\_device(). It should be safe to do once
since all the boot time buses must have their MCFG areas in MCFG table
already and we don't support PCI bus hot-plug.

xprtrdma: Send Queue size grows after a reconnect
[ Upstream commit 98ef77d1aaa7a2f4e1b2a721faa084222021fda7 ]
Eli Dorfman reports that after a series of idle disconnects, an
RPC/RDMA transport becomes unusable (rdma\_create\_qp returns
-ENOMEM). Problem was tracked down to increasing Send Queue size
after each reconnect.
The rdma\_create\_qp() API does not promise to leave its @qp\_init\_attr
parameter unaltered. In fact, some drivers do modify one or more of
its fields. Thus our calls to rdma\_create\_qp must use a fresh copy
of ib\_qp\_init\_attr each time.
This fix is appropriate for kernels dating back to late 2007, though
it will have to be adapted, as the connect code has changed over the
years.

xen/xenbus: fix self-deadlock after killing user process

DTS: ARM: gta04: introduce legacy spi-cs-high to make display work again
commit f1f028ff89cb0d37db299d48e7b2ce19be040d52 upstream.
commit 6953c57ab172 "gpio: of: Handle SPI chipselect legacy bindings"
did introduce logic to centrally handle the legacy spi-cs-high property
in combination with cs-gpios. This assumes that the polarity
of the CS has to be inverted if spi-cs-high is missing, even
and especially if non-legacy GPIO\_ACTIVE\_HIGH is specified.
The DTS for the GTA04 was orginally introduced under the assumption
that there is no need for spi-cs-high if the gpio is defined with
proper polarity GPIO\_ACTIVE\_HIGH.
This was not a problem until gpiolib changed the interpretation of
GPIO\_ACTIVE\_HIGH and missing spi-cs-high.
The effect is that the missing spi-cs-high is now interpreted as CS being
low (despite GPIO\_ACTIVE\_HIGH) which turns off the SPI interface when the
panel is to be programmed by the panel driver.
Therefore, we have to add the redundant and legacy spi-cs-high property
to properly activate CS.

libnvdimm/altmap: Track namespace boundaries in altmap
commit cf387d9644d8c78721cf9b77af9f67bb5b04da16 upstream.
With PFN\_MODE\_PMEM namespace, the memmap area is allocated from the device
area. Some architectures map the memmap area with large page size. On
architectures like ppc64, 16MB page for memap mapping can map 262144 pfns.
This maps a namespace size of 16G.
When populating memmap region with 16MB page from the device area,
make sure the allocated space is not used to map resources outside this
namespace. Such usage of device area will prevent a namespace destroy.
Add resource end pnf in altmap and use that to check if the memmap area
allocation can map pfn outside the namespace. On ppc64 in such case we fallback
to allocation from memory.

Revert "locking/pvqspinlock: Don't wait if vCPU is preempted"
commit 89340d0935c9296c7b8222b6eab30e67cb57ab82 upstream.
This patch reverts commit 75437bb304b20 (locking/pvqspinlock: Don't
wait if vCPU is preempted). A large performance regression was caused
by this commit. on over-subscription scenarios.
The test was run on a Xeon Skylake box, 2 sockets, 40 cores, 80 threads,
with three VMs of 80 vCPUs each. The score of ebizzy -M is reduced from
13000-14000 records/s to 1700-1800 records/s:
Host Guest score
vanilla w/o kvm optimizations upstream 1700-1800 records/s
vanilla w/o kvm optimizations revert 13000-14000 records/s
vanilla w/ kvm optimizations upstream 4500-5000 records/s
vanilla w/ kvm optimizations revert 14000-15500 records/s
Exit from aggressive wait-early mechanism can result in premature yield
and extra scheduling latency.
Actually, only 6% of wait\_early events are caused by vcpu\_is\_preempted()
being true. However, when one vCPU voluntarily releases its vCPU, all
the subsequently waiters in the queue will do the same and the cascading
effect leads to bad performance.

mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: set DMA snooping based on DMA coherence
commit 121bd08b029e03404c451bb237729cdff76eafed upstream.
We must not unconditionally set the DMA snoop bit; if the DMA API is
assuming that the device is not DMA coherent, and the device snoops the
CPU caches, the device can see stale cache lines brought in by
speculative prefetch.
This leads to the device seeing stale data, potentially resulting in
corrupted data transfers. Commonly, this results in a descriptor fetch
error such as:

but can lead to other errors, and potentially direct the SDHCI

Fix this by ensuring that the DMA snoop bit corresponds with the
behaviour of the DMA API. Since the driver currently only supports DT,
use of\_dma\_is\_coherent(). Note that device\_get\_dma\_attr() can not be
used as that risks re-introducing this bug if/when the driver is
converted to ACPI.

mmc: sdhci: improve ADMA error reporting
commit d1c536e3177390da43d99f20143b810c35433d1f upstream.
ADMA errors are potentially data corrupting events; although we print
the register state, we do not usefully print the ADMA descriptors.
Worse than that, we print them by referencing their virtual address
which is meaningless when the register state gives us the DMA address
of the failing descriptor.
Print the ADMA descriptors giving their DMA addresses rather than their
virtual addresses, and print them using SDHCI\_DUMP() rather than DBG().
We also do not show the correct value of the interrupt status register;
the register dump shows the current value, after we have cleared the
pending interrupts we are going to service. What is more useful is to
print the interrupts that \_were\_ pending at the time the ADMA error was
encountered. Fix that too.

mmc: tegra: Implement ->set\_dma\_mask()
commit b960bc448a252428bacca271f3416a8bda3b599b upstream.
The SDHCI controller on Tegra186 supports 40-bit addressing, which is
usually enough to address all of system memory. However, if the SDHCI
controller is behind an IOMMU, the address space can go beyond. This
happens on Tegra186 and later where the ARM SMMU has an input address
space of 48 bits. If the DMA API is backed by this ARM SMMU, the top-
down IOVA allocator will cause IOV addresses to be returned that the
SDHCI controller cannot access.
Unfortunately, prior to the introduction of the ->set\_dma\_mask() host
operation, the SDHCI core would set either a 64-bit DMA mask if the
controller claimed to support 64-bit addressing, or a 32-bit DMA mask
otherwise.
Since the full 64 bits cannot be addressed on Tegra, this had to be
worked around in commit 68481a7e1c84 ("mmc: tegra: Mark 64 bit dma
broken on Tegra186") by setting the SDHCI\_QUIRK2\_BROKEN\_64\_BIT\_DMA
quirk, which effectively restricts the DMA mask to 32 bits.
One disadvantage of this is that dma\_map\_\*() APIs will now try to use
the swiotlb to bounce DMA to addresses beyond of the controller's DMA
mask. This in turn caused degraded performance and can lead to
situations where the swiotlb buffer is exhausted, which in turn leads
to DMA transfers to fail.
With the recent introduction of the ->set\_dma\_mask() host operation,
this can now be properly fixed. For each generation of Tegra, the exact
supported DMA mask can be configured. This kills two birds with one
stone: it avoids the use of bounce buffers because system memory never
exceeds the addressable memory range of the SDHCI controllers on these
devices, and at the same time when an IOMMU is involved, it prevents
IOV addresses from being allocated beyond the addressible range of the
controllers.
Since the DMA mask is now properly handled, the 64-bit DMA quirk can be
removed.

Drivers typically expect this, as it's the case for almost all cases
where this is called (i.e. from the TX path). Also, the code in mac80211
itself (if the driver calls ieee80211\_tx\_dequeue()) expects this as it
uses this\_cpu\_ptr() without additional protection.
This should fix various reports of the problem:

drm/i915: to make vgpu ppgtt notificaiton as atomic operation
commit 9e77f5001b9833a6bdd3940df245053c2212a32b upstream.
vgpu ppgtt notification was split into 2 steps, the first step is to
update PVINFO's pdp register and then write PVINFO's g2v\_notify register
with action code to tirgger ppgtt notification to GVT side.
currently these steps were not atomic operations due to no any protection,
so it is easy to enter race condition state during the MTBF, stress and
IGT test to cause GPU hang.
the solution is to add a lock to make vgpu ppgtt notication as atomic
operation.

drm/i915/gvt: update vgpu workload head pointer correctly
commit 0a3242bdb47713e09cb004a0ba4947d3edf82d8a upstream.
when creating a vGPU workload, the guest context head pointer should
be updated correctly by comparing with the exsiting workload in the
guest worklod queue including the current running context.
in some situation, there is a running context A and then received 2 new
vGPU workload context B and A. in the new workload context A, it's head
pointer should be updated with the running context A's tail.
v2: walk through guest workload list in backward way.

drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Don't create MSTMs for eDP connectors
commit 698c1aa9f83b618de79e9e5e19a58f70a4a6ae0f upstream.
On the ThinkPad P71, we have one eDP connector exposed along with 5 DP
connectors, resulting in a total of 11 TMDS encoders. Since the GPU on
this system is also capable of MST, we create an additional 4 fake MST
encoders for each DP port. Unfortunately, we also do this for the eDP
port as well, resulting in:
1 eDP port: +1 TMDS encoder
+4 DPMST encoders
5 DP ports: +2 TMDS encoders
+4 DPMST encoders
\*5 ports
== 35 encoders
Which breaks things, since DRM has a hard coded limit of 32 encoders.
So, fix this by not creating MSTMs for any eDP connectors. This brings
us down to 31 encoders, although we can do better.
This fixes driver probing for nouveau on the ThinkPad P71.

drm/omap: fix max fclk divider for omap36xx
commit e2c4ed148cf3ec8669a1d90dc66966028e5fad70 upstream.
The OMAP36xx and AM/DM37x TRMs say that the maximum divider for DSS fclk
(in CM\_CLKSEL\_DSS) is 32. Experimentation shows that this is not
correct, and using divider of 32 breaks DSS with a flood or underflows
and sync losts. Dividers up to 31 seem to work fine.
There is another patch to the DT files to limit the divider correctly,
but as the DSS driver also needs to know the maximum divider to be able
to iteratively find good rates, we also need to do the fix in the DSS
driver.

drm/atomic: Take the atomic toys away from X
commit 26b1d3b527e7bf3e24b814d617866ac5199ce68d upstream.
The -modesetting ddx has a totally broken idea of how atomic works:
- doesn't disable old connectors, assuming they get auto-disable like
with the legacy setcrtc
- assumes ASYNC\_FLIP is wired through for the atomic ioctl
- not a single call to TEST\_ONLY
Iow the implementation is a 1:1 translation of legacy ioctls to
atomic, which is a) broken b) pointless.
We already have bugs in both i915 and amdgpu-DC where this prevents us
from enabling neat features.
If anyone ever cares about atomic in X we can easily add a new atomic
level (req->value == 2) for X to get back the shiny toys.
Since these broken versions of -modesetting have been shipping,
there's really no other way to get out of this bind.
v2:
- add an informational dmesg output (Rob, Ajax)
- reorder after the DRIVER\_ATOMIC check to avoid useless noise (Ilia)
- allow req->value > 2 so that X can do another attempt at atomic in
the future
v3: Go with paranoid, insist that the X should be first (suggested by
Rob)

If there's anyone else then we need to silently accept this flag no

drm/i915/dp: Fix dsc bpp calculations, v5.
commit cffb4c3ea37248c4fc2f4ce747e5c24af88aec76 upstream.
There was a integer wraparound when mode\_clock became too high,
and we didn't correct for the FEC overhead factor when dividing,
with the calculations breaking at HBR3.
As a result our calculated bpp was way too high, and the link width
limitation never came into effect.
Print out the resulting bpp calcululations as a sanity check, just
in case we ever have to debug it later on again.
We also used the wrong factor for FEC. While bspec mentions 2.4%,
all the calculations use 1/0.972261, and the same ratio should be
applied to data M/N as well, so use it there when FEC is enabled.
This fixes the FIFO underrun we are seeing with FEC enabled.
Changes since v2:
- Handle fec\_enable in intel\_link\_compute\_m\_n, so only data M/N is adjusted. (Ville)
- Fix initial hardware readout for FEC. (Ville)
Changes since v3:
- Remove bogus fec\_to\_mode\_clock. (Ville)
Changes since v4:
- Use the correct register for icl. (Ville)
- Split hw readout to a separate patch.

perf stat: Fix a segmentation fault when using repeat forever
commit 443f2d5ba13d65ccfd879460f77941875159d154 upstream.
Observe a segmentation fault when 'perf stat' is asked to repeat forever
with the interval option.
Without fix:
# perf stat -r 0 -I 5000 -e cycles -a sleep 10
# time counts unit events
5.000211692 3,13,89,82,34,157 cycles
10.000380119 1,53,98,52,22,294 cycles
10.040467280 17,16,79,265 cycles
Segmentation fault
This problem was only observed when we use forever option aka -r 0 and
works with limited repeats. Calling print\_counter with ts being set to
NULL, is not a correct option when interval is set. Hence avoid
print\_counter(NULL,..) if interval is set.
With fix:
# perf stat -r 0 -I 5000 -e cycles -a sleep 10
# time counts unit events
5.019866622 3,15,14,43,08,697 cycles

watchdog: imx2\_wdt: fix min() calculation in imx2\_wdt\_set\_timeout
commit 144783a80cd2cbc45c6ce17db649140b65f203dd upstream.
Converting from ms to s requires dividing by 1000, not multiplying. So
this is currently taking the smaller of new\_timeout and 1.28e8,
i.e. effectively new\_timeout.
The driver knows what it set max\_hw\_heartbeat\_ms to, so use that
value instead of doing a division at run-time.
FWIW, this can easily be tested by booting into a busybox shell and
doing "watchdog -t 5 -T 130 /dev/watchdog" - without this patch, the
watchdog fires after 130&127 == 2 seconds.

PCI: Restore Resizable BAR size bits correctly for 1MB BARs
commit d2182b2d4b71ff0549a07f414d921525fade707b upstream.
In a Resizable BAR Control Register, bits 13:8 control the size of the BAR.
The encoded values of these bits are as follows (see PCIe r5.0, sec
7.8.6.3):
Value BAR size
0 1 MB (2^20 bytes)
1 2 MB (2^21 bytes)
2 4 MB (2^22 bytes)
...
43 8 EB (2^63 bytes)
Previously we incorrectly set the BAR size bits for a 1 MB BAR to 0x1f
instead of 0, so devices that support that size, e.g., new megaraid\_sas and

timer: Read jiffies once when forwarding base clk
commit e430d802d6a3aaf61bd3ed03d9404888a29b9bf9 upstream.
The timer delayed for more than 3 seconds warning was triggered during
testing.
Workqueue: events\_unbound sched\_tick\_remote
RIP: 0010:sched\_tick\_remote+0xee/0x100

The reason is that the code in collect\_expired\_timers() uses jiffies
unprotected:
if (next\_event > jiffies)
base->clk = jiffies;
As the compiler is allowed to reload the value base->clk can advance
between the check and the store and in the worst case advance farther than
next event. That causes the timer expiry to be delayed until the wheel
pointer wraps around.
Convert the code to use READ\_ONCE()

usercopy: Avoid HIGHMEM pfn warning
commit 314eed30ede02fa925990f535652254b5bad6b65 upstream.
When running on a system with >512MB RAM with a 32-bit kernel built with:
CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VIRTUAL=y
CONFIG\_HIGHMEM=y
CONFIG\_HARDENED\_USERCOPY=y
all execve()s will fail due to argv copying into kmap()ed pages, and on
usercopy checking the calls ultimately of virt\_to\_page() will be looking
for "bad" kmap (highmem) pointers due to CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VIRTUAL=y:
------------[ cut here ]------------

The check is from arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c:

Due to the kmap() in fs/exec.c:
kaddr = kmap(kmapped\_page);
...
if (copy\_from\_user(kaddr+offset, str, bytes\_to\_copy)) ...
Now we can fetch the correct page to avoid the pfn check. In both cases,
hardened usercopy will need to walk the page-span checker (if enabled)
to do sanity checking.

tracing: Make sure variable reference alias has correct var\_ref\_idx
commit 17f8607a1658a8e70415eef67909f990d13017b5 upstream.
Original changelog from Steve Rostedt (except last sentence which
explains the problem, and the Fixes: tag):
I performed a three way histogram with the following commands:
echo 'irq\_lat u64 lat pid\_t pid' > synthetic\_events
echo 'wake\_lat u64 lat u64 irqlat pid\_t pid' >> synthetic\_events
echo 'hist:keys=common\_pid:irqts=common\_timestamp.usecs if function == 0xffffffff81200580' > events/timer/hrtimer\_start/trigger
echo 'hist:keys=common\_pid:lat=common\_timestamp.usecs-$irqts:onmatch(timer.hrtimer\_start).irq\_lat($lat,pid) if common\_flags & 1' > events/sched/sched\_waking/trigger
echo 'hist:keys=pid:wakets=common\_timestamp.usecs,irqlat=lat' > events/synthetic/irq\_lat/trigger
echo 'hist:keys=next\_pid:lat=common\_timestamp.usecs-$wakets,irqlat=$irqlat:onmatch(synthetic.irq\_lat).wake\_lat($lat,$irqlat,next\_pid)' > events/sched/sched\_switch/trigger
echo 1 > events/synthetic/wake\_lat/enable
Basically I wanted to see:
hrtimer\_start (calling function tick\_sched\_timer)
Note:
# grep tick\_sched\_timer /proc/kallsyms
ffffffff81200580 t tick\_sched\_timer
And save the time of that, and then record sched\_waking if it is called
in interrupt context and with the same pid as the hrtimer\_start, it
will record the latency between that and the waking event.
I then look at when the task that is woken is scheduled in, and record
the latency between the wakeup and the task running.
At the end, the wake\_lat synthetic event will show the wakeup to
scheduled latency, as well as the irq latency in from hritmer\_start to
the wakeup. The problem is that I found this:
-0 [007] d... 190.485261: wake\_lat: lat=27 irqlat=190485230 pid=698
-0 [005] d... 190.485283: wake\_lat: lat=40 irqlat=190485239 pid=10
-0 [002] d... 190.488327: wake\_lat: lat=56 irqlat=190488266 pid=335
-0 [005] d... 190.489330: wake\_lat: lat=64 irqlat=190489262 pid=10
-0 [003] d... 190.490312: wake\_lat: lat=43 irqlat=190490265 pid=77
-0 [005] d... 190.493322: wake\_lat: lat=54 irqlat=190493262 pid=10
-0 [005] d... 190.497305: wake\_lat: lat=35 irqlat=190497267 pid=10
-0 [005] d... 190.501319: wake\_lat: lat=50 irqlat=190501264 pid=10
The irqlat seemed quite large! Investigating this further, if I had
enabled the irq\_lat synthetic event, I noticed this:
-0 [002] d.s. 249.429308: irq\_lat: lat=164968 pid=335
-0 [002] d... 249.429369: wake\_lat: lat=55 irqlat=249429308 pid=335
Notice that the timestamp of the irq\_lat "249.429308" is awfully
similar to the reported irqlat variable. In fact, all instances were
like this. It appeared that:
irqlat=$irqlat
Wasn't assigning the old $irqlat to the new irqlat variable, but
instead was assigning the $irqts to it.
The issue is that assigning the old $irqlat to the new irqlat variable
creates a variable reference alias, but the alias creation code
forgets to make sure the alias uses the same var\_ref\_idx to access the
reference.

power: supply: sbs-battery: only return health when battery present
commit fe55e770327363304c4111423e6f7ff3c650136d upstream.
when the battery is set to sbs-mode and no gpio detection is enabled
"health" is always returning a value even when the battery is not present.
All other fields return "not present".
This leads to a scenario where the driver is constantly switching between
"present" and "not present" state. This generates a lot of constant
traffic on the i2c.
This commit changes the response of "health" to an error when the battery
is not responding leading to a consistent "not present" state.

Make sure IV transfer happens first by waiting for all CAAM internal

crypto: caam/qi - fix error handling in ERN handler
commit 51fab3d73054ca5b06b26e20edac0486b052c6f4 upstream.
ERN handler calls the caam/qi frontend "done" callback with a status
of -EIO. This is incorrect, since the callback expects a status value
meaningful for the crypto engine - hence the cryptic messages
like the one below:
platform caam\_qi: 15: unknown error source
Fix this by providing the callback with:
-the status returned by the crypto engine (fd[status]) in case
it contains an error, OR
-a QI "No error" code otherwise; this will trigger the message:
platform caam\_qi: 50000000: Queue Manager Interface: No error
which is fine, since QMan driver provides details about the cause of
failure

commit 0ba3c026e685573bd3534c17e27da7c505ac99c4 upstream.
skcipher\_walk\_done may be called with an error by internal or
external callers. For those internal callers we shouldn't unmap
pages but for external callers we must unmap any pages that are
in use.
This patch distinguishes between the two cases by checking whether
walk->nbytes is zero or not. For internal callers, we now set
walk->nbytes to zero prior to the call. For external callers,
walk->nbytes has always been non-zero (as zero is used to indicate
the termination of a walk).

tools lib traceevent: Fix "robust" test of do\_generate\_dynamic\_list\_file
commit 82a2f88458d70704be843961e10b5cef9a6e95d3 upstream.
The tools/lib/traceevent/Makefile had a test added to it to detect a failure
of the "nm" when making the dynamic list file (whatever that is). The
problem is that the test sorts the values "U W w" and some versions of sort
will place "w" ahead of "W" (even though it has a higher ASCII value, and
break the test.
Add 'tr "w" "W"' to merge the two and not worry about the ordering.

powerpc/mm: Fixup tlbie vs mtpidr/mtlpidr ordering issue on POWER9
commit 047e6575aec71d75b765c22111820c4776cd1c43 upstream.
On POWER9, under some circumstances, a broadcast TLB invalidation will
fail to invalidate the ERAT cache on some threads when there are
parallel mtpidr/mtlpidr happening on other threads of the same core.
This can cause stores to continue to go to a page after it's unmapped.
The workaround is to force an ERAT flush using PID=0 or LPID=0 tlbie
flush. This additional TLB flush will cause the ERAT cache
invalidation. Since we are using PID=0 or LPID=0, we don't get
filtered out by the TLB snoop filtering logic.
We need to still follow this up with another tlbie to take care of
store vs tlbie ordering issue explained in commit:
a5d4b5891c2f ("powerpc/mm: Fixup tlbie vs store ordering issue on
POWER9"). The presence of ERAT cache implies we can still get new
stores and they may miss store queue marking flush.

We can only do this on PowerNV. On pseries guest with KVM we still
don't support redoing the feature fixup after migration. So we should
be enabling all the workarounds needed, because whe can possibly
migrate between DD 2.3 and DD 2.2

powerpc/kasan: Fix shadow area set up for modules.
commit 663c0c9496a69f80011205ba3194049bcafd681d upstream.
When loading modules, from time to time an Oops is encountered during
the init of shadow area for globals. This is due to the last page not
always being mapped depending on the exact distance between the start
and the end of the shadow area and the alignment with the page
addresses.
Fix this by aligning the starting address with the page address.

commit 45ff3c55958542c3b76075d59741297b8cb31cbb upstream.
Parallel loading of modules may lead to bad setup of shadow page table
entries.
First, lets align modules so that two modules never share the same
shadow page.
Second, ensure that two modules cannot allocate two page tables for
the same PMD entry at the same time. This is done by using
init\_mm.page\_table\_lock in the same way as \_\_pte\_alloc\_kernel()

powerpc/powernv/ioda: Fix race in TCE level allocation
commit 56090a3902c80c296e822d11acdb6a101b322c52 upstream.
pnv\_tce() returns a pointer to a TCE entry and originally a TCE table
would be pre-allocated. For the default case of 2GB window the table
needs only a single level and that is fine. However if more levels are
requested, it is possible to get a race when 2 threads want a pointer
to a TCE entry from the same page of TCEs.
This adds cmpxchg to handle the race. Note that once TCE is non-zero,
it cannot become zero again.

powerpc/pseries: Fix cpu\_hotplug\_lock acquisition in resize\_hpt()
commit c784be435d5dae28d3b03db31753dd7a18733f0c upstream.
The calls to arch\_add\_memory()/arch\_remove\_memory() are always made
with the read-side cpu\_hotplug\_lock acquired via memory\_hotplug\_begin().
On pSeries, arch\_add\_memory()/arch\_remove\_memory() eventually call
resize\_hpt() which in turn calls stop\_machine() which acquires the
read-side cpu\_hotplug\_lock again, thereby resulting in the recursive
acquisition of this lock.
In the absence of CONFIG\_PROVE\_LOCKING, we hadn't observed a system
lockup during a memory hotplug operation because cpus\_read\_lock() is a
per-cpu rwsem read, which, in the fast-path (in the absence of the
writer, which in our case is a CPU-hotplug operation) simply
increments the read\_count on the semaphore. Thus a recursive read in
the fast-path doesn't cause any problems.
However, we can hit this problem in practice if there is a concurrent
CPU-Hotplug operation in progress which is waiting to acquire the
write-side of the lock. This will cause the second recursive read to
block until the writer finishes. While the writer is blocked since the
first read holds the lock. Thus both the reader as well as the writers
fail to make any progress thereby blocking both CPU-Hotplug as well as
Memory Hotplug operations.

If a page is already mapped RW without the DIRTY flag, the DIRTY
flag is never set and a TLB store miss exception is taken forever.
This is easily reproduced with the following app:
void main(void)
{
volatile char \*ptr = mmap(0, 4096, PROT\_READ | PROT\_WRITE, MAP\_SHARED | MAP\_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);
\*ptr = \*ptr;
}

a minor page fault which will set the DIRTY flag.

powerpc/xive: Implement get\_irqchip\_state method for XIVE to fix shutdown race
commit da15c03b047dca891d37b9f4ef9ca14d84a6484f upstream.
Testing has revealed the existence of a race condition where a XIVE
interrupt being shut down can be in one of the XIVE interrupt queues
(of which there are up to 8 per CPU, one for each priority) at the
point where free\_irq() is called. If this happens, can return an
interrupt number which has been shut down. This can lead to various
symptoms:
- irq\_to\_desc(irq) can be NULL. In this case, no end-of-interrupt
function gets called, resulting in the CPU's elevated interrupt
priority (numerically lowered CPPR) never gets reset. That then
means that the CPU stops processing interrupts, causing device
timeouts and other errors in various device drivers.
- The irq descriptor or related data structures can be in the process
of being freed as the interrupt code is using them. This typically
leads to crashes due to bad pointer dereferences.
This race is basically what commit 62e0468650c3 ("genirq: Add optional
hardware synchronization for shutdown", 2019-06-28) is intended to
fix, given a get\_irqchip\_state() method for the interrupt controller
being used. It works by polling the interrupt controller when an
interrupt is being freed until the controller says it is not pending.
With XIVE, the PQ bits of the interrupt source indicate the state of
the interrupt source, and in particular the P bit goes from 0 to 1 at
the point where the hardware writes an entry into the interrupt queue
that this interrupt is directed towards. Normally, the code will then
process the interrupt and do an end-of-interrupt (EOI) operation which
will reset PQ to 00 (assuming another interrupt hasn't been generated
in the meantime). However, there are situations where the code resets
P even though a queue entry exists (for example, by setting PQ to 01,
which disables the interrupt source), and also situations where the
code leaves P at 1 after removing the queue entry (for example, this
is done for escalation interrupts so they cannot fire again until
they are explicitly re-enabled).
The code already has a 'saved\_p' flag for the interrupt source which
indicates that a queue entry exists, although it isn't maintained
consistently. This patch adds a 'stale\_p' flag to indicate that
P has been left at 1 after processing a queue entry, and adds code
to set and clear saved\_p and stale\_p as necessary to maintain a
consistent indication of whether a queue entry may or may not exist.
With this, we can implement xive\_get\_irqchip\_state() by looking at
stale\_p, saved\_p and the ESB PQ bits for the interrupt.
There is some additional code to handle escalation interrupts
properly; because they are enabled and disabled in KVM assembly code,
which does not have access to the xive\_irq\_data struct for the
escalation interrupt. Hence, stale\_p may be incorrect when the
escalation interrupt is freed in kvmppc\_xive\_{,native\_}cleanup\_vcpu().
Fortunately, we can fix it up by looking at vcpu->arch.xive\_esc\_on,
with some careful attention to barriers in order to ensure the correct
result if xive\_esc\_irq() races with kvmppc\_xive\_cleanup\_vcpu().
Finally, this adds code to make noise on the console (pr\_crit and
WARN\_ON(1)) if we find an interrupt queue entry for an interrupt
which does not have a descriptor. While this won't catch the race
reliably, if it does get triggered it will be an indication that
the race is occurring and needs to be debugged.

ASoC: sgtl5000: Improve VAG power and mute control
commit b1f373a11d25fc9a5f7679c9b85799fe09b0dc4a upstream.
VAG power control is improved to fit the manual [1]. This patch fixes as
minimum one bug: if customer muxes Headphone to Line-In right after boot,
the VAG power remains off that leads to poor sound quality from line-in.
I.e. after boot:
- Connect sound source to Line-In jack;
- Connect headphone to HP jack;
- Run following commands:
$ amixer set 'Headphone' 80%
$ amixer set 'Headphone Mux' LINE\_IN
Change VAG power on/off control according to the following algorithm:
- turn VAG power ON on the 1st incoming event.
- keep it ON if there is any active VAG consumer (ADC/DAC/HP/Line-In).
- turn VAG power OFF when there is the latest consumer's pre-down event
come.
- always delay after VAG power OFF to avoid pop.
- delay after VAG power ON if the initiative consumer is Line-In, this
prevents pop during line-in muxing.
According to the data sheet [1], to avoid any pops/clicks,
the outputs should be muted during input/output
routing changes.

PM / devfreq: tegra: Fix kHz to Hz conversion
commit 62bacb06b9f08965c4ef10e17875450490c948c0 upstream.
The kHz to Hz is incorrectly converted in a few places in the code,
this results in a wrong frequency being calculated because devfreq core
uses OPP frequencies that are given in Hz to clamp the rate, while
tegra-devfreq gives to the core value in kHz and then it also expects to
receive value in kHz from the core. In a result memory freq is always set
to a value which is close to ULONG\_MAX because of the bug. Hence the EMC
frequency is always capped to the maximum and the driver doesn't do
anything useful. This patch was tested on Tegra30 and Tegra124 SoC's, EMC
frequency scaling works properly now.

that limited the number of devices to 256. Before the patch we could
create 1000s of devices, but the patch switched us from using our
own thread to using a work queue which has a default limit of 256
active works.
The problem is that our recv\_work function sits in a loop until
disconnection but only handles IO for one connection. The work is
started when the connection is started/restarted, but if we end up
creating 257 or more connections, the queue\_work call just queues
connection257+'s recv\_work and that waits for connection 1 - 256's
recv\_work to be disconnected and that work instance completing.
Instead of reverting back to kthreads, this has us allocate a
workqueue\_struct per device, so we can block in the work.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't lose pending doorbell request on migration on P9
commit ff42df49e75f053a8a6b4c2533100cdcc23afe69 upstream.
On POWER9, when userspace reads the value of the DPDES register on a
vCPU, it is possible for 0 to be returned although there is a doorbell
interrupt pending for the vCPU. This can lead to a doorbell interrupt
being lost across migration. If the guest kernel uses doorbell
interrupts for IPIs, then it could malfunction because of the lost
interrupt.
This happens because a newly-generated doorbell interrupt is signalled
by setting vcpu->arch.doorbell\_request to 1; the DPDES value in
vcpu->arch.vcore->dpdes is not updated, because it can only be updated
when holding the vcpu mutex, in order to avoid races.
To fix this, we OR in vcpu->arch.doorbell\_request when reading the
DPDES value.

it. This adds that check, and also a check when we select the
secondary vcores from the preempted vcores list.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix race in re-enabling XIVE escalation interrupts
commit 959c5d5134786b4988b6fdd08e444aa67d1667ed upstream.
Escalation interrupts are interrupts sent to the host by the XIVE
hardware when it has an interrupt to deliver to a guest VCPU but that
VCPU is not running anywhere in the system. Hence we disable the
escalation interrupt for the VCPU being run when we enter the guest
and re-enable it when the guest does an H\_CEDE hypercall indicating
it is idle.
It is possible that an escalation interrupt gets generated just as we
are entering the guest. In that case the escalation interrupt may be
using a queue entry in one of the interrupt queues, and that queue
entry may not have been processed when the guest exits with an H\_CEDE.
The existing entry code detects this situation and does not clear the
vcpu->arch.xive\_esc\_on flag as an indication that there is a pending
queue entry (if the queue entry gets processed, xive\_esc\_irq() will
clear the flag). There is a comment in the code saying that if the
flag is still set on H\_CEDE, we have to abort the cede rather than
re-enabling the escalation interrupt, lest we end up with two
occurrences of the escalation interrupt in the interrupt queue.
However, the exit code doesn't do that; it aborts the cede in the sense
that vcpu->arch.ceded gets cleared, but it still enables the escalation
interrupt by setting the source's PQ bits to 00. Instead we need to
set the PQ bits to 10, indicating that an interrupt has been triggered.
We also need to avoid setting vcpu->arch.xive\_esc\_on in this case
(i.e. vcpu->arch.xive\_esc\_on seen to be set on H\_CEDE) because
xive\_esc\_irq() will run at some point and clear it, and if we race with
that we may end up with an incorrect result (i.e. xive\_esc\_on set when
the escalation interrupt has just been handled).
It is extremely unlikely that having two queue entries would cause
observable problems; theoretically it could cause queue overflow, but
the CPU would have to have thousands of interrupts targetted to it for
that to be possible. However, this fix will also make it possible to
determine accurately whether there is an unhandled escalation
interrupt in the queue, which will be needed by the following patch.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't push XIVE context when not using XIVE device
commit 8d4ba9c931bc384bcc6889a43915aaaf19d3e499 upstream.
At present, when running a guest on POWER9 using HV KVM but not using
an in-kernel interrupt controller (XICS or XIVE), for example if QEMU
is run with the kernel\_irqchip=off option, the guest entry code goes
ahead and tries to load the guest context into the XIVE hardware, even
though no context has been set up.
To fix this, we check that the "CAM word" is non-zero before pushing
it to the hardware. The CAM word is initialized to a non-zero value
in kvmppc\_xive\_connect\_vcpu() and kvmppc\_xive\_native\_connect\_vcpu(),
and is now cleared in kvmppc\_xive\_{,native\_}cleanup\_vcpu.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Free escalation interrupts before disabling the VP
commit 237aed48c642328ff0ab19b63423634340224a06 upstream.
When a vCPU is brought done, the XIVE VP (Virtual Processor) is first
disabled and then the event notification queues are freed. When freeing
the queues, we check for possible escalation interrupts and free them
also.
But when a XIVE VP is disabled, the underlying XIVE ENDs also are
disabled in OPAL. When an END (Event Notification Descriptor) is
disabled, its ESB pages (ESn and ESe) are disabled and loads return all
1s. Which means that any access on the ESB page of the escalation
interrupt will return invalid values.
When an interrupt is freed, the shutdown handler computes a 'saved\_p'
field from the value returned by a load in xive\_do\_source\_set\_mask().
This value is incorrect for escalation interrupts for the reason
described above.
This has no impact on Linux/KVM today because we don't make use of it
but we will introduce in future changes a xive\_get\_irqchip\_state()
handler. This handler will use the 'saved\_p' field to return the state
of an interrupt and 'saved\_p' being incorrect, softlockup will occur.
Fix the vCPU cleanup sequence by first freeing the escalation interrupts
if any, then disable the XIVE VP and last free the queues.

KVM: PPC: Book3S: Enable XIVE native capability only if OPAL has required functions
commit 2ad7a27deaf6d78545d97ab80874584f6990360e upstream.
There are some POWER9 machines where the OPAL firmware does not support
the OPAL\_XIVE\_GET\_QUEUE\_STATE and OPAL\_XIVE\_SET\_QUEUE\_STATE calls.
The impact of this is that a guest using XIVE natively will not be able
to be migrated successfully. On the source side, the get\_attr operation
on the KVM native device for the KVM\_DEV\_XIVE\_GRP\_EQ\_CONFIG attribute
will fail; on the destination side, the set\_attr operation for the same
attribute will fail.
This adds tests for the existence of the OPAL get/set queue state
functions, and if they are not supported, the XIVE-native KVM device
is not created and the KVM\_CAP\_PPC\_IRQ\_XIVE capability returns false.
Userspace can then either provide a software emulation of XIVE, or
else tell the guest that it does not have a XIVE controller available
to it.

allocated space respectively.
During some internal performance improvements and further tests, the
release of allocated space revealed some issues that may lead to data
corruption in some configurations when filesystems are mounted with

As a command reject will occur in such a case, the current error
handling leads to a failing online processing and thus the DASD can't be
used at all.
Since the data being read is not essential for an fully operational
DASD, the error handling can be removed. Information about the failing
command is sent to the s390dbf debug feature.

s390/cio: exclude subchannels with no parent from pseudo check
commit ab5758848039de9a4b249d46e4ab591197eebaf2 upstream.
ccw console is created early in start\_kernel and used before css is
initialized or ccw console subchannel is registered. Until then console
subchannel does not have a parent. For that reason assume subchannels
with no parent are not pseudo subchannels. This fixes the following
kasan finding:

KVM: s390: Test for bad access register and size at the start of S390\_MEM\_OP
commit a13b03bbb4575b350b46090af4dfd30e735aaed1 upstream.
If the KVM\_S390\_MEM\_OP ioctl is called with an access register >= 16,
then there is certainly a bug in the calling userspace application.
We check for wrong access registers, but only if the vCPU was already
in the access register mode before (i.e. the SIE block has recorded
it). The check is also buried somewhere deep in the calling chain (in
the function ar\_translation()), so this is somewhat hard to find.
It's better to always report an error to the userspace in case this
field is set wrong, and it's safer in the KVM code if we block wrong
values here early instead of relying on a check somewhere deep down
the calling chain, so let's add another check to kvm\_s390\_guest\_mem\_op()
directly.
We also should check that the "size" is non-zero here (thanks to Janosch
Frank for the hint!). If we do not check the size, we could call vmalloc()
with this 0 value, and this will cause a kernel warning.

Subject: Linux kernel: multiple vulnerabilities in the USB subsystem x3

Hi!

More CVEs for bugs in Linux kernel USB drivers that can be triggered
by an external malicious USB device. Found with syzkaller [1]. This
time no obvious DoSs (see the discussions here [2, 3]): mostly UAFs,
some info-leaks. All of these bugs have been fixed upstream (but many
other syzbot USB bugs are still not fixed [4]).
