Despite extensive testing and auditing, some corner cases were missed.\n\nA malicious PV guest administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host.\n\nAll security-supported versions of Xen are vulnerable.\n\nOnly x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected.\n\nOnly x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability.\n\nThese attacks require very precise timing, which may be difficult to exploit in practice."
