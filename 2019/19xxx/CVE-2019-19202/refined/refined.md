Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19202:

*   **Vulnerability:** Insufficient permission checking on the "roleid" parameter during profile editing in Vtiger CRM.

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly validate whether a user has the necessary permissions to modify the "roleid" parameter when editing their profile.

*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper authorization checks. The application trusts user-supplied input for "roleid" without verifying if the user is authorized to change their role.

*   **Attack Vector:** A non-admin user can modify their own profile and include the "roleid" parameter in the request, changing their role to one with higher privileges.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Vtiger CRM system. They do not need administrative privileges initially.

*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation. A user with limited permissions (e.g., a "guest" role) can elevate their privileges to a higher-level role (e.g., "CEO") by manipulating the "roleid" parameter. This allows them to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionalities within the CRM.

*   **Technical Details:**

    *   When an administrator edits a user's profile, the "roleid" parameter is included in the request.
    *   When a regular user edits their profile, the "roleid" parameter is not present by default.
    *   However, if a regular user manually adds the "roleid" parameter to the request (e.g., by intercepting and modifying the HTTP request), the application accepts it and modifies the user's role accordingly.
    *   The "is\_admin" parameter is also present when an administrator edits the profile, however the permissions seems to be enforced on this one and a non admin user can't modify it.

*   **Mitigation:** The vulnerability was addressed in Vtiger CRM 7.1.0 Hotfix3. The fix likely involves implementing proper permission checks to ensure that only administrators can modify the "roleid" parameter.

*   **Credits:** Mohnish Dhage and Samuel De Grace are credited with reporting the vulnerability.
