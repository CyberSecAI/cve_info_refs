The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Centreon 19.04, specifically related to URL redirection, and is related to CVE-2019-19486.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the "p" parameter within the login process (specifically in `./include/core/login/login.php` line 119). This parameter, intended for some hidden functionality, is not sanitized or validated, leading to an open redirect. The "p" parameter persists in the URL even after successful login.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open URL Redirection: The application does not properly validate the `p` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject a malicious URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing: Attackers can craft malicious URLs that redirect users to phishing sites.
- Malware distribution: Attackers can redirect users to websites hosting malware.
- Session hijacking: In combination with other vulnerabilities, this could lead to session hijacking or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL crafting: An attacker can create a crafted URL containing a malicious redirect within the "p" parameter.
- Social Engineering: The attacker could distribute the malicious URL via email, social media, or other channels, tricking users into clicking the link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special access or privileges are required.
- The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute URLs that contain a malicious payload in the vulnerable 'p' parameter
