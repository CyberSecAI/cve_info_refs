Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19252:

**Root Cause:**

- The virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict write operations to unimplemented `vcsu` (unicode) devices. Specifically, the driver lacked proper checks to prevent writes to these devices, even though the write functionality for them was not implemented.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Missing Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of validation that would prevent write operations to the unimplemented unicode virtual console devices. The code was intended to only handle read operations.
- **Lack of proper restriction:** The code does not check whether the device being written to is an implemented and supported device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (System Crash):** A local attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by writing to the unimplemented `vcsu` devices. The exact mechanism for the crash isn't specified, but it is likely due to the write operation triggering an unexpected condition.
- **Unspecified Impacts**: The vulnerability also carries potential for "other unspecified impacts". This suggests the possibility of other exploitable conditions, though they are not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- **Direct Access to `/dev/vcsu*` device:** The attacker needs to be able to open and write to a `/dev/vcsu*` device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a user on the target system.
- **File Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to open and write to the virtual console device files (e.g. `/dev/vcsu6`).

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- **Patch:** The patch provided prevents writing to `vcsu` devices, by adding a check at the beginning of the `vcs_write` function that returns `-EOPNOTSUPP` if writing to a unicode enabled vcs device.
- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions prior to the fix. The fix was backported to Linux kernel 4.19 and later.
- **NetApp Products:** Several NetApp products are affected due to their inclusion of the vulnerable Linux kernel.

In summary, CVE-2019-19252 involves a local denial-of-service vulnerability stemming from missing write restrictions to unimplemented virtual console devices within the Linux kernel. An attacker with local access can trigger a system crash, potentially leading to other unknown impacts.
