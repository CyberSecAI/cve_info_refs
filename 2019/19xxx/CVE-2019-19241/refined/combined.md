platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by passing 0 as input size
commit f3e4f3fc8ee9729c4b1b27a478c68b713df53c0c upstream.
The AML code implementing the WMI methods creates a variable length
field to hold the input data we pass like this:
CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x0C, DSZI)
Local5 = DSZI /\* \HWMC.DSZI \*/
CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, (Local5 \* 0x08), DAIN)
If we pass 0 as bios\_args.datasize argument then (Local5 \* 0x08)
is 0 which results in these errors:
[ 71.973305] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Attempt to CreateField of length zero (20190816/dsopcode-133)
[ 71.973332] ACPI Error: Aborting method \HWMC due to previous error (AE\_AML\_OPERAND\_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
[ 71.973413] ACPI Error: Aborting method \\_SB.WMID.WMAA due to previous error (AE\_AML\_OPERAND\_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
And in our HPWMI\_WIRELESS2\_QUERY calls always failing. for read commands
like HPWMI\_WIRELESS2\_QUERY the DSZI value is not used / checked, except for
read commands where extra input is needed to specify exactly what to read.
So for HPWMI\_WIRELESS2\_QUERY we can safely pass the size of the expected
output as insize to hp\_wmi\_perform\_query(), as we are already doing for all
other HPWMI\_READ commands we send. Doing so fixes these errors.

platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by too small buffer
commit 16245db1489cd9aa579506f64afeeeb13d825a93 upstream.
The HP WMI calls may take up to 128 bytes of data as input, and
the AML methods implementing the WMI calls, declare a couple of fields for
accessing input in different sizes, specifycally the HWMC method contains:
CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, 0x0400, D128)
Even though we do not use any of the WMI command-types which need a buffer
of this size, the APCI interpreter still tries to create it as it is
declared in generoc code at the top of the HWMC method which runs before
the code looks at which command-type is requested.
This results in many of these errors on many different HP laptop models:
[ 14.459261] ACPI Error: Field [D128] at 1152 exceeds Buffer [NULL] size 160 (bits) (20170303/dsopcode-236)
[ 14.459268] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\HWMC] (Node ffff8edcc61507f8), AE\_AML\_BUFFER\_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
[ 14.459279] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\\_SB.WMID.WMAA] (Node ffff8edcc61523c0), AE\_AML\_BUFFER\_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
This commit increases the size of the data element of the bios\_args struct
to 128 bytes fixing these errors.

HID: core: check whether Usage Page item is after Usage ID items
commit 1cb0d2aee26335d0bccf29100c7bed00ebece851 upstream.
Upstream commit 58e75155009c ("HID: core: move Usage Page concatenation
to Main item") adds support for Usage Page item after Usage ID items
(such as keyboards manufactured by Primax).
Usage Page concatenation in Main item works well for following report
descriptor patterns:
USAGE\_PAGE (Keyboard) 05 07
USAGE\_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl) 19 E0
USAGE\_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI) 29 E7
LOGICAL\_MINIMUM (0) 15 00
LOGICAL\_MAXIMUM (1) 25 01
REPORT\_SIZE (1) 75 01
REPORT\_COUNT (8) 95 08
INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) 81 02
-------------
USAGE\_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl) 19 E0
USAGE\_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI) 29 E7
LOGICAL\_MINIMUM (0) 15 00
LOGICAL\_MAXIMUM (1) 25 01
REPORT\_SIZE (1) 75 01
REPORT\_COUNT (8) 95 08
USAGE\_PAGE (Keyboard) 05 07
INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) 81 02
But it makes the parser act wrong for the following report
descriptor pattern(such as some Gamepads):
USAGE\_PAGE (Button) 05 09
USAGE (Button 1) 09 01
USAGE (Button 2) 09 02
USAGE (Button 4) 09 04
USAGE (Button 5) 09 05
USAGE (Button 7) 09 07
USAGE (Button 8) 09 08
USAGE (Button 14) 09 0E
USAGE (Button 15) 09 0F
USAGE (Button 13) 09 0D
USAGE\_PAGE (Consumer Devices) 05 0C
USAGE (Back) 0a 24 02
USAGE (HomePage) 0a 23 02
LOGICAL\_MINIMUM (0) 15 00
LOGICAL\_MAXIMUM (1) 25 01
REPORT\_SIZE (1) 75 01
REPORT\_COUNT (11) 95 0B
INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) 81 02
With Usage Page concatenation in Main item, parser recognizes all the
11 Usages as consumer keys, it is not the HID device's real intention.
This patch checks whether Usage Page is really defined after Usage ID
items by comparing usage page using status.
Usage Page concatenation on currently defined Usage Page will always
do in local parsing when Usage ID items encountered.
When Main item is parsing, concatenation will do again with last
defined Usage Page if this page has not been used in the previous
usages concatenation.

ext4: add more paranoia checking in ext4\_expand\_extra\_isize handling
commit 4ea99936a1630f51fc3a2d61a58ec4a1c4b7d55a upstream.
It's possible to specify a non-zero s\_want\_extra\_isize via debugging
option, and this can cause bad things(tm) to happen when using a file
system with an inode size of 128 bytes.
Add better checking when the file system is mounted, as well as when
we are actually doing the trying to do the inode expansion.

selftests: pmtu: use -oneline for ip route list cache
[ Upstream commit 2745aea6750ff0d2c48285d25bdb00e5b636ec8b ]
Some versions of iproute2 will output more than one line per entry, which
will cause the test to fail, like:
TEST: ipv6: list and flush cached exceptions [FAIL]
can't list cached exceptions
That happens, for example, with iproute2 4.15.0. When using the -oneline
option, this will work just fine:
TEST: ipv6: list and flush cached exceptions [ OK ]
This also works just fine with a more recent version of iproute2, like
5.4.0.
For some reason, two lines are printed for the IPv4 test no matter what
version of iproute2 is used. Use the same -oneline parameter there instead
of counting the lines twice.

net/tls: remove the dead inplace\_crypto code

Looks like when BPF support was added by commit d3b18ad31f93
("tls: add bpf support to sk\_msg handling") and
commit d829e9c4112b ("tls: convert to generic sk\_msg interface")
it broke/removed the support for in-place crypto as added by
commit 4e6d47206c32 ("tls: Add support for inplace records
encryption").
The inplace\_crypto member of struct tls\_rec is dead, inited
to zero, and sometimes set to zero again. It used to be
set to 1 when record was allocated, but the skmsg code doesn't
seem to have been written with the idea of in-place crypto
in mind.
Since non trivial effort is required to bring the feature back
and we don't really have the HW to measure the benefit just
remove the left over support for now to avoid confusing readers.

net: skmsg: fix TLS 1.3 crash with full sk\_msg
[ Upstream commit 031097d9e079e40dce401031d1012e83d80eaf01 ]
TLS 1.3 started using the entry at the end of the SG array
for chaining-in the single byte content type entry. This mostly
works:
[ E E E E E E . . ]
^ ^
start end
E < content type
/
[ E E E E E E C . ]
^ ^
start end
(Where E denotes a populated SG entry; C denotes a chaining entry.)
If the array is full, however, the end will point to the start:
[ E E E E E E E E ]
^
start
end
And we end up overwriting the start:
E < content type
/
[ C E E E E E E E ]
^
start
end
The sg array is supposed to be a circular buffer with start and
end markers pointing anywhere. In case where start > end
(i.e. the circular buffer has "wrapped") there is an extra entry
reserved at the end to chain the two halves together.
[ E E E E E E . . l ]
(Where l is the reserved entry for "looping" back to front.
As suggested by John, let's reserve another entry for chaining
SG entries after the main circular buffer. Note that this entry
has to be pointed to by the end entry so its position is not fixed.
Examples of full messages:
[ E E E E E E E E . l ]
^ ^
start end
<---------------.
[ E E . E E E E E E l ]
^ ^
end start
Now the end will always point to an unused entry, so TLS 1.3
can always use it.

It was caused by rhashtable access asoc->base.sk when sctp\_assoc\_migrate
is changing its value. However, what rhashtable wants is netns from asoc
base.sk, and for an asoc, its netns won't change once set. So we can
simply fix it by caching netns since created.

net: sched: fix `tc -s class show` no bstats on class with nolock subqueues
[ Upstream commit 14e54ab9143fa60794d13ea0a66c792a2046a8f3 ]
When a classful qdisc's child qdisc has set the flag
TCQ\_F\_CPUSTATS (pfifo\_fast for example), the child qdisc's
cpu\_bstats should be passed to gnet\_stats\_copy\_basic(),
but many classful qdisc didn't do that. As a result,
`tc -s class show dev DEV` always return 0 for bytes and
packets in this case.
Pass the child qdisc's cpu\_bstats to gnet\_stats\_copy\_basic()
to fix this issue.
The qstats also has this problem, but it has been fixed
in 5dd431b6b9 ("net: sched: introduce and use qstats read...")
and bstats still remains buggy.

net: psample: fix skb\_over\_panic
[ Upstream commit 7eb9d7675c08937cd11d32b0b40442d4d731c5ee ]
We need to calculate the skb size correctly otherwise we risk triggering
skb\_over\_panic[1]. The issue is that data\_len is added to the skb in a
nl attribute, but we don't account for its header size (nlattr 4 bytes)
and alignment. We account for it when calculating the total size in
the > PSAMPLE\_MAX\_PACKET\_SIZE comparison correctly, but not when
allocating after that. The fix is simple - use nla\_total\_size() for
data\_len when allocating.
To reproduce:
$ tc qdisc add dev eth1 clsact
$ tc filter add dev eth1 egress matchall action sample rate 1 group 1 trunc 129
$ mausezahn eth1 -b bcast -a rand -c 1 -p 129

macvlan: schedule bc\_work even if error
[ Upstream commit 1d7ea55668878bb350979c377fc72509dd6f5b21 ]
While enqueueing a broadcast skb to port->bc\_queue, schedule\_work()
is called to add port->bc\_work, which processes the skbs in
bc\_queue, to "events" work queue. If port->bc\_queue is full, the
skb will be discarded and schedule\_work(&port->bc\_work) won't be
called. However, if port->bc\_queue is full and port->bc\_work is not
running or pending, port->bc\_queue will keep full and schedule\_work()
won't be called any more, and all broadcast skbs to macvlan will be
discarded. This case can happen:
macvlan\_process\_broadcast() is the pending function of port->bc\_work,
it moves all the skbs in port->bc\_queue to the queue "list", and
processes the skbs in "list". During this, new skbs will keep being
added to port->bc\_queue in macvlan\_broadcast\_enqueue(), and
port->bc\_queue may already full when macvlan\_process\_broadcast()
return. This may happen, especially when there are a lot of real-time
threads and the process is preempted.
Fix this by calling schedule\_work(&port->bc\_work) even if
port->bc\_work is full in macvlan\_broadcast\_enqueue().

x86/fpu: Don't cache access to fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx
commit 59c4bd853abcea95eccc167a7d7fd5f1a5f47b98 upstream.
The state/owner of the FPU is saved to fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx by pointing
to the context that is currently loaded. It never changed during the
lifetime of a task - it remained stable/constant.
After deferred FPU registers loading until return to userland was
implemented, the content of fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx may change during
preemption and must not be cached.
This went unnoticed for some time and was now noticed, in particular
since gcc 9 is caching that load in copy\_fpstate\_to\_sigframe() and
reusing it in the retry loop:
copy\_fpstate\_to\_sigframe()
load fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx and save on stack
fpregs\_lock()
copy\_fpregs\_to\_sigframe() /\* failed \*/
fpregs\_unlock()
\*\*\* PREEMPTION, another uses FPU, changes fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx \*\*\*
fault\_in\_pages\_writeable() /\* succeed, retry \*/
fpregs\_lock()
\_\_fpregs\_load\_activate()
fpregs\_state\_valid() /\* uses fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx from stack \*/
copy\_fpregs\_to\_sigframe() /\* succeeds, random FPU content \*/
This is a comparison of the assembly produced by gcc 9, without vs with this

Use this\_cpu\_read() instead this\_cpu\_read\_stable() to avoid caching of
fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx during preemption points.
The Fixes: tag points to the commit where deferred FPU loading was
added. Since this commit, the compiler is no longer allowed to move the
load of fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx somewhere else / outside of the locked
section. A task preemption will change its value and stale content will
be observed.

thunderbolt: Power cycle the router if NVM authentication fails
commit 7a7ebfa85f4fac349f3ab219538c44efe18b0cf6 upstream.
On zang's Dell XPS 13 9370 after Thunderbolt NVM firmware upgrade the
Thunderbolt controller did not come back as expected. Only after the
system was rebooted it became available again. It is not entirely clear
what happened but I suspect the new NVM firmware image authentication
failed for some reason. Regardless of this the router needs to be power
cycled if NVM authentication fails in order to get it fully functional
again.
This modifies the driver to issue a power cycle in case the NVM
authentication fails immediately when dma\_port\_flash\_update\_auth()
returns. We also need to call tb\_switch\_set\_uuid() earlier to be able to
fetch possible NVM authentication failure when DMA port is added.

Testing on different generations of Lantiq MIPS SoC based boards, showed
that it takes up to 1500 us until the core reset bit is cleared.
The driver from the vendor SDK (ifxhcd) uses a 1 second timeout. Use the
same timeout to fix wrong hang detections and make the driver work for
Lantiq MIPS SoCs.
At least till kernel 4.14 the hanging reset only caused a warning but
the driver was probed successful. With kernel 4.19 errors out with
EBUSY.

mismatching type trips indirect call Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) checking.
This change adds a callback function with the correct type and instead
of casting the function, explicitly casts the second parameter to struct

crypto: inside-secure - Fix stability issue with Macchiatobin
commit b8c5d882c8334d05754b69dcdf1cfd6bc48a9e12 upstream.
This patch corrects an error in the Transform Record Cache initialization
code that was causing intermittent stability problems on the Macchiatobin
board.
Unfortunately, due to HW platform specifics, the problem could not happen
on the main development platform, being the VCU118 Xilinx development
board. And since it was a problem with hash table access, it was very
dependent on the actual physical context record DMA buffers being used,
i.e. with some (bad) luck it could seemingly work quit stable for a while.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

net: disallow ancillary data for \_\_sys\_{send,recv}msg\_file()Only io\_uring uses (and added) these, and we want to disallow the
use of sendmsg/recvmsg for anything but regular data transfers.
Use the newly added prep helper to split the msghdr copy out from
the core function, to check for msg\_control and msg\_controllen
settings. If either is set, we return -EINVAL.
