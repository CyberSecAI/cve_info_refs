Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19382:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is insecure permissions on the installation directory of Max Secure Anti Virus Plus. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the fact that Authenticated Users, Users, SYSTEM, and Administrators all have full control (F) permissions on the directory `C:\Program Files\Max Secure Anti Virus Plus`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary weakness is that standard users and even malware running with low integrity can modify or replace files within the Max Secure Anti Virus Plus installation directory due to overly permissive access control lists (ACLs). This should be restricted to admin level users, not any authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker or malware can leverage this by replacing legitimate executables (`.exe`) or dynamic link libraries (`.dll`) within the installation directory with malicious ones. When a user or the system launches the replaced executable, the attacker's code will be executed, potentially leading to privilege escalation, allowing a standard user to gain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker would need to have access to the machine with the vulnerable software installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Access:** An attacker must have local access to the system. They could be a standard user or a malicious program running with standard user or low integrity rights.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Product:** Max Secure Anti Virus Plus version 19.0.4.020.
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC):** A C code PoC is provided that demonstrates the exploit by replacing the `MaxSDUI.exe` file with a malicious one.
*   **Disclosure Timeline:** The disclosure timeline indicates that the vendor was notified on November 19, 2019, and a public disclosure occurred on November 29, 2019 after lack of response from the vendor.
*   **Severity:** The severity is rated as High.
*   **Video PoC:** The advisory includes a link to a YouTube video demonstrating the exploit.
