- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The web interface of Siemens XHQ Operations Intelligence is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser, potentially leading to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of website content, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker can trick unsuspecting users into accessing a malicious link, which then executes malicious code within the user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated (no required privileges). The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking the malicious link (user interaction required).
