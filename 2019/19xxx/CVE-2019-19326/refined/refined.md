- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of `X-Original-Url` and `X-HTTP-Method-Override` headers, as well as the `_method` parameter in POST requests, can lead to web cache poisoning.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in how Silverstripe CMS processes HTTP headers and request parameters when HTTP caching is enabled. By manipulating these values, attackers can generate unexpected responses, which might get cached and served to other users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can poison the cache with responses that have malicious HTTP headers. This could lead to various issues depending on how request data is used by the site. It can include content manipulation on the website through cached responses. The risk is heightened when the site accepts user-generated content.
- **Attack vectors:** The primary attack vectors are the `X-Original-Url` and `X-HTTP-Method-Override` headers, and the `_method` parameter in POST requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send manipulated HTTP requests to the server. There also needs to be an intermediary HTTP cache (such as a CDN or proxy) for the attack to be effective.
