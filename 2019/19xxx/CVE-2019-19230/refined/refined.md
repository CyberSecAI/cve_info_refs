Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insecure deserialization in the DataManagement component of CA Nolio (Release Automation).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   The primary weakness is the presence of insecure deserialization. This means the application is processing serialized data without proper validation, allowing for manipulation of the data stream.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This can lead to complete compromise of the server hosting the vulnerable component.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is remote and involves exploiting the DataManagement service of CA Nolio. An attacker can send a malicious serialized object to the service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to reach the DataManagement service. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned to be required, implying this vulnerability can be triggered remotely and without needing prior access to the system.

**Affected Products:**
*   CA Nolio (formerly CA Release Automation) 6.6 on all supported platforms. The vulnerability affects the DataManagement component which is a core component running on Management Servers (NACs)

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was discovered by Jakub Palaczynski and Robert Podsiadlo from ING Tech Poland.
* Patches are available for both Linux and Windows platforms.
