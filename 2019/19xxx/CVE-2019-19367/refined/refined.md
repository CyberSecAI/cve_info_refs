**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of input sanitization of the `id` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript in the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to entice the victim to click on a malicious URL that contains the payload for the XSS attack.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges on the system.
