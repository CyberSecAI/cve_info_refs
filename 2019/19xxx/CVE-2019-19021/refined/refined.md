Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities, including CVE-2019-19021, and others:

**CVE-2019-19021: The “support” account (Hard-coded administrative password)**

*   **Root Cause:** The WebTitan appliance includes a pre-configured "support" user account with a hardcoded password.
*   **Weakness:**  Hard-coded credentials. The support account does not appear in the web interface, so it is not easily discoverable nor is it clear how to change the password.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can log into the web interface with administrative privileges using this hardcoded password. This allows them to perform any administrative action on the appliance, including executing arbitrary code using the backup restore function vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access to the WebTitan appliance's web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to access the WebTitan web interface, potentially over a proxy connection.

**Additional Vulnerabilities Identified:**

1.  **CVE-2019-19019: Arbitrary code execution as root (same as CVE-2019-6800):**
    *   **Root Cause:**  The `wt-hotfix.sh` script downloads a shell script from an HTTP server and executes it as root.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure script download and execution. The script uses plain HTTP for download, making it vulnerable to MITM attacks, and executes it directly without validation.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution as root.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Man-in-the-middle attack on the HTTP connection or by controlling the hotfix script source.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to intercept HTTP traffic or control the server hosting the hotfix script.

2.  **CVE-2019-19015: Database access via proxy service (Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution):**
    *   **Root Cause:** The proxy service (Squid) on the WebTitan appliance allows connections to local ports, including the PostgreSQL port (5432), without authentication.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure proxy configuration. Allowing access to the database server through the proxy without authentication enables attackers to gain full control over it
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthenticated access to the database, allowing the attacker to modify any table (including admin users) and execute code as the database user (pgsql).
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Direct connection to the proxy service (TCP/8881).
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to connect to the proxy on TCP/8881.

3. **CVE-2019-19020: Exploiting the backup restore function (Authenticated Remote Code Execution)**
    * **Root Cause:** The backup restore function is vulnerable to code injection because the backup files are not properly validated when uploaded.
    * **Weakness:** Insufficient validation and sanitization of the backup files during the restore process.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution as user `www` by uploading a crafted backup.
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting the backup/restore function via the web interface.
    * **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Administrative access to the web interface.

4.  **CVE-2019-19014: Privilege Escalation:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Overly permissive `sudoers` configuration allows the `www` user to execute numerous commands as root without a password.
    *   **Weakness:** Weak sudoers file configuration.
    *   **Impact:**  Privilege escalation from the `www` user to root.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting sudo permissions as user `www`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Shell access as the `www` user.

5. **CVE-2019-19016: SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `history-x.php` page is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `results` parameter.
    *   **Weakness:** Insufficient input sanitization in the application code.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential data leakage and/or manipulation of the database.
    *   **Attack Vector:** HTTP GET request to the vulnerable page.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Network access to the vulnerable page.

6.  **CVE-2019-19017: Hard-coded root password:**
    *   **Root Cause:** A hardcoded root password is set during installation via a `sed` script.
    *   **Weakness:** Hard-coded credentials.
    *   **Impact:** If root login is enabled remotely, a remote attacker could gain root access to the machine.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the system or by leveraging another vulnerability.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Physical or remote shell access to the system.

7. **CVE-2019-19018: Database config files under webroot:**
    * **Root Cause:** A database configuration file (`dbconfig.ini`) is exposed under the webroot, revealing database user information.
    * **Weakness:** Information exposure vulnerability, although the username (titax) is commonly known.
    * **Impact:** May aid an attacker in crafting further exploits
    *   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to the file under the web interface.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to access the web interface.

**Other Observations (not CVEs):**

*   **Weird support connection:** The support connection system uses a reverse SSH tunnel to `support.webtitan.com`, which is running unpatched software, and potentially expose other customer devices.
*   **Hard-coded authorized SSH key:** The `admin` user has a hardcoded SSH key with the ID `root@src_wt.webtitan.com`.
*   **`ssh-dss` explicitly enabled:**  `ssh-dss` is enabled for `support.webtitan.com` in the ssh configuration, although it is deprecated.
*   **SQL injection on first boot:**  The rc.d scripts fetch data from 169.254.169.254 and use it in SQL queries without sanitization
*   **Cachemgr XSS:** The Squid cache manager interface is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.

**Summary:**

The provided content reveals multiple critical vulnerabilities affecting the WebTitan appliance. These include remote code execution, privilege escalation, database compromise and insecure default configurations. The most critical vulnerabilities are the unauthenticated remote code execution through the proxy service (CVE-2019-19015), the arbitrary code execution through the `hotfix.sh` script (CVE-2019-19019), and the hardcoded support password (CVE-2019-19021) allowing administrative access. The backup restore function also enables remote code execution if an attacker has administrative access (CVE-2019-19020). The combination of these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to completely compromise the WebTitan appliance and the network it protects.
