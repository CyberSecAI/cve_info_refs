Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19821:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the iTop web application not properly handling HTTP 302 redirects when administrative actions are attempted by a regular user. While the server responds with a redirect, it still includes the entire administrative interface within the HTTP body. The client browser is expected to follow the redirect and discard the response body. However, an attacker can intercept the response and use the administrative interface in the HTTP body, effectively bypassing authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper authorization enforcement, allowing a regular authenticated user to access administrative functionalities.
*   **Insecure Redirect Handling:** The server returns a redirect with the administrative interface, exposing the interface to unauthorized users.
*   **Insufficient Server-Side Validation:** Administrative actions are executed server-side. Once an attacker has the admin interface, it's possible to make modifications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can gain full administrative access to the iTop web application.
*   **Data Access & Modification:** This includes access to all tickets, the IT inventory, user information, and the ability to modify any of this data.
*   **Service Disruption:** Attackers could leverage the administrative access to disrupt or impair the services managed by iTop.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attack requires intercepting the server response to the user that includes an HTTP 302 redirect. This can be achieved using a local proxy.
*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** Specifically, the "Location" header that would initiate the redirect must be deleted to force the browser to not redirect, and keep the malicious admin body of the response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the iTop application.
*   **Network Proxy:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP response between the client and the server (e.g. by using a proxy).
*   **Ability to manipulate HTTP headers:** The attacker must be able to delete or modify the "Location" header in the server's HTTP response to keep the admin body content.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on iTop versions 2.3.1 and 2.6.1.
*   The issue was reported to Combodo on December 10, 2019, and a fix was released on January 22, 2020, for professional and essential versions, and on February 5, 2020, for the community version.
*   The provided github commit (`248dab9289ad4900037fe9adba88c3860aa08301`) shows the single line code addition that fixed the vulnerability by preventing the response body to be included during redirects.
*   A workaround is to use a Web Application Firewall to remove the HTTP body from 302 redirects, but this mitigation is not perfect, since actions could be modified and information could leak via other channels.
