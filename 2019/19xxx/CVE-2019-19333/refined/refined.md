CVE-2019-19333:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `make_canonical()` function within parser.c of libyang when handling "bits" type leaves with names exceeding 511 bytes. This occurs due to the use of `strcpy` without proper length checks, leading to a buffer overflow when copying the long "bits" type name into a fixed-size stack buffer.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Stack-based buffer overflow, insecure usage of `strcpy`, lack of input validation.
  - Impact of exploitation: A successful exploit could lead to a denial of service or potentially allow arbitrary code execution on the affected system. An application that parses untrusted YANG files is vulnerable.
  - Attack vectors: The vulnerability can be triggered when parsing a specially crafted YANG module that includes a "bits" type leaf with a name longer than 511 bytes.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to provide the application with a malicious YANG file. The attacker doesn't need to be on the same machine, just need to be able to send the file to the vulnerable application.
