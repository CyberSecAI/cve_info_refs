Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-19836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `zap` executable, a network performance test tool, has an argument parsing vulnerability in its handling of the `-D` option. Specifically, when parsing the debug filename, start point, and end point from the provided string, a stack buffer overflow can occur. This happens because the code uses `strncpy` but uses the full input string length, thus overflowing a small buffer allocated on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `zap` executable.
*   **Unauthenticated access:** The `zap` executable can be called through the web interface via an unauthenticated request using the `AjaxRestrictedCmdStat()` function, which calls the `doCommand()` function, then calls the shell script wrapper to execute `zap`.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The web interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied data passed to the `zap` command, allowing an attacker to control the arguments passed to `zap`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the stack buffer overflow, an attacker can gain remote code execution on the affected device. Specifically, they can overwrite the return address, redirecting the code flow to a malicious ROP chain and eventually execute arbitrary code.
*   **Arbitrary File Write:** The `-L` option in `zap` allows writing to arbitrary locations, which is used in the third attack scenario to write a malicious `jsp` page. This is not a direct impact of the overflow, but of the lack of sanitization when using the `zap` utility.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HTTP POST request to the `/tools/_cmdstat.jsp` endpoint, which is processed by the web interface.
*   **XML Payload:** The HTTP request includes an XML payload with specific parameters that cause the `emfd` process to call `zap` with malicious arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Ruckus access point's web interface.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability is exploitable without requiring prior authentication.
*   **Understanding of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable `zap` command's argument parsing and how to construct the specific payload to trigger the stack overflow.
*   **ROP Gadget Knowledge**: Since NX and ASLR are enabled, the attacker needs to know how to craft ROP chains and overcome the ASLR randomisation using a brute force approach.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content describes how this vulnerability is chained with other vulnerabilities (like arbitrary file write and command injection) to achieve a complete compromise of the Ruckus device. Specifically, the arbitrary file write vulnerability is exploited by using the `-L` option of `zap` alongside the `-T` and `-S` options, to write a malicious JSP page to `/web/uploaded/index.jsp` which then allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands.
*   The `zap` utility is also vulnerable to SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).
*   The document also provides the specific ROP chain used to achieve remote code execution.

**Summary of CVE-2019-19836 based on the provided content:**

CVE-2019-19836 is caused by a stack buffer overflow in the `zap` executable's argument processing of the `-D` argument. This vulnerability is exploitable via a crafted HTTP POST request to the Ruckus AP's web interface without authentication, allowing an attacker to achieve remote code execution through the use of an ROP chain. It is also used as a component in a chain of vulnerabilities that result in full system compromise via an arbitrary file write and command injection.
