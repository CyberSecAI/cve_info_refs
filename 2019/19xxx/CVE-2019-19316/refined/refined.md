Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from Terraform's use of cleartext HTTP to transmit state snapshots when interacting with Azure Blob Storage under specific conditions. This occurs when a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token is used for authentication and is not explicitly configured to require HTTPS, and when the storage container is configured to allow HTTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission:** Terraform transmits state data over unencrypted HTTP when the Azure backend is configured with a non-HTTPS SAS token, exposing sensitive information to eavesdropping.
- **Lack of Default HTTPS Enforcement:** Older versions of the Azure SDK used by Terraform did not enforce HTTPS by default when using SAS tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exposure:** Attackers with access to network traffic can intercept and read the Terraform state, including any secrets stored within (e.g., API keys, passwords, etc.).
- **Credential Compromise:** Exposed API keys or other credentials can lead to unauthorized access to other systems and services.
- **Infrastructure Compromise:** Full access to the infrastructure could be obtained by reading the Terraform state.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Eavesdropping:** An attacker with the ability to monitor network traffic between Terraform and Azure Blob Storage can intercept the cleartext data. This could occur on an untrusted network, or through a compromised network device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be positioned to intercept network traffic between Terraform and Azure Blob Storage. This could involve being on the same network, having compromised a network device, or utilizing other techniques to capture network packets.
- **No Direct Access to Terraform Configuration:** The attacker does not need direct access to the Terraform configuration files or Azure credentials beyond what is exposed through network traffic.
- **Timing:** The attack needs to be timed to coincide with Terraform operations that transmit state data, such as "terraform apply."

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Terraform 0.12.17 by upgrading the Azure SDK to ensure HTTPS is selected by default.
- Mitigation strategies include using SAS tokens that explicitly require HTTPS and configuring the Azure blob storage container to only allow HTTPS.
- This information provides more detail than a typical CVE description, including specific conditions that must be met for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
