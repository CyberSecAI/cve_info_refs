  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-19579",
    "description": "XSA-302 relies on the use of libxl's \"assignable-add\" feature to prepare devices to be assigned to untrusted guests. Unfortunately, this is not considered a strictly required step for device assignment. The PCI passthrough documentation on the wiki describes alternate ways of preparing devices for assignment, and libvirt uses its own ways as well. Hosts where these \"alternate\" methods are used will still leave the system in a vulnerable state after the device comes back from a guest.",
    "affected_systems": "Only systems where guests are given direct access to physical devices capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) are vulnerable. Systems which do not use PCI pass-through are not vulnerable. Only systems which use \"alternate\" methods to assign devices to pciback before assignment are vulnerable.  These methods include:\n - Assigning devices on the Linux command-line using `xen-pciback.hide`\n - Assigning devices via xen-pciback module parameters\n - Assigning devices manually via sysfs\n - Assigning devices using libvirt\nSystems which use `xl pci-assignable-add` or libxl_device_pci_assignable_add, or have the assignable state handled automatically via setting the `seize` parameter, are not affected.",
    "impact": "An untrusted domain with access to a physical device can DMA into host memory, leading to privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vector": "An untrusted domain with access to a physical device capable of DMA (PCI pass-through) can DMA into host memory if the device was assigned using alternate methods.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An untrusted domain with access to a physical device.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability exists because alternate methods of assigning PCI devices to guests do not properly quarantine the device, allowing DMA into host memory.",
    "resolution": "For xl and libvirt, before assigning a device to a guest, manually run `xl pci-assignable-add`. This will quarantine the device even if the device has already been assigned to pciback by one of the alternate methods. Patches are available to resolve this issue."
