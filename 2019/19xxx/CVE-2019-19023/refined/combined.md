# Privilege Escalation

Critical

[michmike](/michmike)
published
GHSA-3868-7c5x-4827
Dec 3, 2019

## Package

Harbor
(Harbor)

## Affected versions

1.7.\*, 1.8.\*, 1.9.\*

## Patched versions

1.9.3 and 1.8.6

## Description

# Impact

External Security Researchers have identified a privilege escalation critical vulnerability. The vulnerability allows

a normal user to gain administrator account privileges by making an API call to modify the email address of a specific user. Subsequently they can reset the password for that email address and gain access to that account. The Harbor API did not enforce the proper permissions and scope on the API request to modify the email address. The vulnerability was immediately fixed by the Harbor team and all supported versions were patched.

# Known Attack Vectors

Successful exploitation of this issue may lead to unauthorized access throughout the project

# Patches

If your product uses the affected releases of Harbor, update to version 1.8.6 and 1.9.3 to patch this issue immediately.
