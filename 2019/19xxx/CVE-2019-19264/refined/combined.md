T

**Malware Testing**

We research and test various crimeware kits, viruses and malware against your network (in a safe and isolated duplicate environment) to ensure the efficacy of your existing protocol.

T

**Email Systems**

We test your email systems and internal policies to ensure you’re properly defending against malicious emails, and that your team can understand what SPAM, Phishing and Vishing looks like. (Training Sessions Available)

T

**Network Port Security**

We examine all vulnerable network ports to ensure your network policies and conventions are doing their job. We’ll make recommendations for corrective measures in our report at the end of the penetration test.

T

**System Configurations**

We’ll test and make corrective recommendations for system configurations that malicious hackers love to exploit.

T

**Credentials & Authentication**

We’ll examine all network credentials, configurations, policies and procedures surrounding your team’s hardware and software authentication. Your report will include all conceivable vulnerabilities and best recommendations for remediation.

T

**Software Vulnerabilities**

We can perform a deep-dive into any proprietary or third-party service software your organization uses to identify bugs and vulnerable objects that a hacker could exploit. This is particularly important when dealing with sensitive customer and vendor data, as well as handling major or frequent transactions.

T

**Security Software & Services**

We’ll examine your existing network and system security tools, policies and managed services (such as endpoint protection) to identify security gaps and make recommendations for closing them.

T

**Attack Simulation**

We can run a full-scale attack simulation on a specific network, user group or across your entire organization, providing a detailed report of all security vulnerabilities and the recommended steps to repair it at every level.

T

**Firewall Testing**

We can test all hardware and software based firewalls and other connection-based security implementations and make recommendations for repairing their configurations, policies and settings.

T

**Social Engineering**

We can test your organization’s readiness for all the sneaky ways a hacker might work to gain access to your systems and premises. Whether it be leaving an infected USB in the parking lot, faking corporate ID cards or posing as the delivery guy – we can ensure your team knows what to do when they come across these sneaky tactics.

T

**Data Systems Security**

We’ll examine your internal and external data solutions such as servers, cloud providers and remote access conventions for security holes. We’re also able to test your redundant backup systems and ensure hackers don’t have access to your critical infrastructure. Recommendations for remediation will be included in our comprehensive report so you can make sure your business doesn’t grind to a halt in the event of an incident.

T

**Mobile & NFC Endpoints**

We’ll test mobile devices, NFC devices and other “in-the-field” endpoints to ensure hackers are not able to leverage them for entry into your network. You’ll recieve a full report on how to fix the configurations and policies to secure these devices.

T

**Access Control Testing**

We’ll examine any access control systems and associated hardware used to control network or premise authentication for security gaps and vulnerabilities. We’ll provide a detailed report for remediation.

T

**Failsafes & Responders**

We’ll examine how your system alerts and notifications reach the right internal network support personnel (such as your IT team). Certain configurations or settings can be leveraged by an attacker to prevent your system failsafes from triggering and notifying the right person to do something about it. We’ll provide recommendations for remediation in our comprehensive report.

[General](https://www.securenetworkinc.com/category/general/)
RecordFusion Local File Inclusion Vulnerability (CVE-2019-19264)

SNT has found a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the /log and /hist parameter that allows an attacker to view the server’s content through a web browser. This is caused due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Depending on severity, this vulnerability can lead to Code execution, denial of service, or sensitive information disclosure. The affected version of is unknown and SNT assumes it affects all versions of the product.

The web application RecordFusion is vulnerable to an LFI by inputting characters after the following directory:

* http://127.0.0.1/logger/log?/../../../../../
* http://127.0.0.1/logger/hist?/../../../../../

![recordfusioneventlogger.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/56e2e4d97da24fb448c00573/1574782201907-YPCBZRXXM8FMUO4MDCTZ/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBIqIImwtzSj_FyN0t6QdmFZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpxxSjCoCBrZeTOAC7L5_LKwrgRjW0KLVqhK4zyWIkzHgn2P_V6lCdsf8XuOE84k8Ec/recordfusioneventlogger.png)![recordfusioneventlogger.png]()

By navigating to the crafted URL, an attacker is able to see the C:/ drive directory.

**Remediation:** The vendor has not responded to requests.
