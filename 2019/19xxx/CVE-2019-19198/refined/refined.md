Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The "Scoutnet Kalender" WordPress plugin fails to sanitize user-controlled input when embedding calendar events from Scoutnet into a WordPress website. Specifically, the "Info" field of calendar events is not sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-79:** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the affected website via the "Info" field of calendar events.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who controls an embedded Scoutnet calendar can inject scripts into a website that uses the "Scoutnet Kalender" plugin.
*   This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the affected website where the calendar is embedded.
*   The impact can range from minor annoyances to complete compromise of the website user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker needs to control a Scoutnet calendar that is embedded using the "Scoutnet Kalender" plugin on a vulnerable WordPress site.
*   The attacker crafts a malicious script within the "Info" field of an event on the controlled calendar.
*   When the calendar is displayed on the victim website, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have control over a Scoutnet calendar that can be embedded via the vulnerable plugin.
*   The attacker does not need to have direct access to the WordPress website itself.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Simon Moser of SySS GmbH.
*   The plugin was closed on June 22, 2020, due to this security issue and is no longer available for download from the WordPress plugin directory.
*   The advisory suggests that if interactive content needs to be included, the set of users with permissions to create and change events should be minimized.
