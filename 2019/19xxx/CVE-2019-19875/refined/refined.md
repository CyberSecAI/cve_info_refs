  "CVE-2019-19875": {
    "relevance": "UNRELATED",
    "reason": "The provided document is a release note for APROL R4.2 and its updates. It contains no information on a specific vulnerability with a CVE ID. It primarily details new features, security improvements (like disabling FTP, finger services, SSH access restrictions, VNC encryption, LDAP restrictions etc) and fixes implemented in the APROL system. While the document does list several security improvements and vulnerability fixes (memory access errors, SQL injection possibility, remote command execution etc.), it does not tie those fixes to a CVE ID like CVE-2019-19875. Therefore this document is not relevant for CVE-2019-19875"
