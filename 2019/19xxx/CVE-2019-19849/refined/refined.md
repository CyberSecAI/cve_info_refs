      "Insecure deserialization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution possible, leading to complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploitation through the 'ext:lowlevel' extension (DB Check backend module) requiring admin privileges.",
      "Exploitation through the 'ext:sys_action' extension with limited backend user privileges."

    "required_capabilities": [
      "Valid backend user account with administrator privileges if 'ext:lowlevel' is installed.",
       "Valid backend user account with limited privileges if 'ext:sys_action' is installed."
    ],
    "more_information": "The vulnerability resides in the QueryGenerator and QueryView classes within the TYPO3 CMS core. Exploitation requires one of two extensions, 'ext:lowlevel' or 'ext:sys_action', to be installed. The 'ext:lowlevel' attack vector requires a backend user with administrator privileges, while 'ext:sys_action' can be exploited with a user with limited privileges."
