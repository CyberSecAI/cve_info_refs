Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-19043:

*   **Vulnerability:** Memory leak in the `i40e_setup_macvlans()` function within the `drivers/net/ethernet/intel/i40e/i40e_main.c` file of the Linux kernel.
*   **Root Cause:** If `i40e_setup_channel()` fails in `i40e_setup_macvlans()`, the allocated memory for `ch` (channel) is not released, leading to a memory leak.
*   **Attack Vector:** A local attacker can trigger `i40e_setup_channel()` failures to cause a denial of service by exhausting memory resources.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, potentially crashing the system.
*   **Affected Products:** Linux Kernel, NetApp Products that incorporate the affected Linux Kernel version.
*   **Affected versions:** Linux kernel through 5.3.11

The GitHub commit fixes the issue by adding `kfree(ch)` to release the allocated memory when `i40e_setup_channel` fails.
