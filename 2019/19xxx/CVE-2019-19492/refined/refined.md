```
{
  "Root cause": "The FreeSWITCH event socket interface allows execution of system commands using the 'system' API command.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "The event socket service is enabled by default and listens on TCP port 8021 on the local network interface.",
     "The default password for the event socket is 'ClueCon', which is configurable in event_socket.conf.xml but may not always be changed."
  ],
  "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the target system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed remotely via the FreeSWITCH event socket interface on TCP port 8021.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to connect to the FreeSWITCH event socket interface (port 8021) and needs the password (default is 'ClueCon')."
