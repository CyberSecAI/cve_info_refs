Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19312:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that GitLab did not detach the fork relationship when a public project was made private. This allowed users who had forked the project when it was public to continue accessing certain information about the private project via the API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inadequate access control: Even after a project's visibility was changed to private, the API still exposed the "fork_from_project" information. This indicates that the system was not properly checking and enforcing access permissions based on the current privacy settings.
- Information disclosure: The `fork_from_project` attribute revealed details about the private project, violating the intended privacy settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized information disclosure: Users who forked a project while it was public could still "spy" on the private project's information through the API, even though they were not supposed to have access. This could include metadata and project details.

**Attack vectors:**
- API access: The vulnerability was exploited by accessing the GitLab API endpoint (`https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/ID_OF_BAR_PROJECT`) and retrieving the `fork_from_project` data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User needs to have forked a project before it was made private.
- The user needs to have the project ID of their fork.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by `ngalog` through HackerOne.
*   The vulnerability was mitigated in GitLab versions 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7
*   The vulnerability affects GitLab EE versions 8.14 and later.
