The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19636.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the `sixel_encode_body` function within the `tosixel.c` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow occurs in the line `map[pix * width + x] |= (1 << i);` within the `sixel_encode_body` function when processing image pixel data.
- The vulnerability leads to a heap buffer overflow, causing a segmentation fault (SEGV).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The integer overflow leads to a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a crash (segmentation fault) of the application.
- This can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the `img2sixel` utility.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted image file to the `img2sixel` utility.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious image file to the `img2sixel` utility.
