Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19069:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

   - The provided content includes a CVE description from usn.ubuntu.com which explicitly mentions **CVE-2019-19069** as relating to a memory deallocation issue in the Qualcomm FastRPC Driver for the Linux kernel.
   - The commit log from cdn.kernel.org includes a commit titled "misc: fastrpc: prevent memory leak in fastrpc_dma_buf_attach", which directly addresses the vulnerability described in the Ubuntu Security Notice for CVE-2019-19069. This confirms that the commit is indeed a patch for this CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The Qualcomm FastRPC driver in the Linux kernel had a flaw in `fastrpc_dma_buf_attach`, where it failed to deallocate memory assigned to `a` if `dma_get_sgtable` failed.
    *   The issue is triggered when the `dma_get_sgtable` call in the `fastrpc_dma_buf_attach` function fails. In such a scenario the code would return an error but would not free the allocated memory, leading to a leak.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Improper Resource Management:**  The driver allocated memory via `kzalloc` for use in a DMA operation, but failed to free it when an intermediate step failed, resulting in a memory leak.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As described in the Ubuntu Security Notice, a local attacker could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).  Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path could lead to exhaustion of available memory.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** A local attacker would need the ability to trigger operations within the FastRPC driver that results in memory allocation, specifically in `fastrpc_dma_buf_attach`.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to run code on the affected system as a user with the permissions necessary to interact with the fastrpc driver, which could lead to allocating memory through the vulnerable code path. This can be achieved by a local user.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The provided commit log offers a concise technical description of the fix, showing the use of `kfree(a);` in the error path as the mitigation.

*   The Ubuntu Security Notice provides a high-level overview of the vulnerability and its impact.
*  The NetApp advisory indicates a potential for Denial of Service (DoS), and does not list specifics on exploitation beyond "successful exploitation".

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-19069 is caused by a memory leak in the Qualcomm FastRPC driver in the Linux kernel. This occurs when the driver fails to free allocated memory after a failed `dma_get_sgtable` call. A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by exhausting system memory. The fix is to ensure that memory is properly freed when the `dma_get_sgtable` operation fails by adding a `kfree(a)` call to the error path.
