# OpenShift Containers - Modification of /etc/passwd

Updated 2020-04-02T05:48:58+00:00 -
English

* No translations currently exist.

## Background

When OpenShift starts a container, it uses an arbitrarily assigned user ID. This feature helps to ensure that if an application from within a container manages to break out to the host, it won’t be able to interact with other processes and containers owned by other users, in other projects.

If the process has requirements to alter file permissions or retrieve user information, then this security feature will cause problems for the container. For example, the container process needs to perform a whoami or look up it’s `$HOME` directory.

The solution is group permissions. Even though OpenShift runs the container processes as a random UID, the user belongs to the root group.

```
[lab@master-0 ~]$ ps -o pid,group,gid,cmd -C "sleep 10m"
    PID  UID  USER         GID CMD
3840163  1001 quicklab       0 sleep 10m

```

Hence, typically the advice has been to allow the root group to read/write files and directories, by changing the group ownership of those files to root.

**However, it has been found that this advice has also been applied to the `/etc/passwd` file, allowing the random user information to be added to it.**

## The Vulnerability

Product Security were recently notified of a vulnerability in the form of a container privilege escalation. The vulnerability details that when a Dockerfile alters the permissions of it’s own `/etc/passwd` file, it allows for any user (within that container) to escalate to root.

For example, take the following Dockerfile from the Jenkins image:

```
RUN /usr/local/bin/install-jenkins-core-plugins.sh /opt/openshift/base-plugins.txt && \
    rmdir /var/log/jenkins && \
    chmod 664 /etc/passwd && \
    chmod -R 775 /etc/alternatives && \
    chmod -R 775 /var/lib/alternatives && \
    chmod -R 775 /usr/lib/jvm && \
    chmod 775 /usr/bin && \
    chmod 775 /usr/lib/jvm-exports && \
    chmod 775 /usr/share/man/man1 && \
    mkdir -p /var/lib/origin && \
    chmod 775 /var/lib/origin && \
    chown -R 1001:0 /opt/openshift && \

```

As discussed previously, `chmod 664 /etc/passwd` not only allows the random user’s data to be added to the `/etc/passwd` file, but also allows any process from within that container to modify `/etc/passwd`.

For example, if using a container in which the Dockerfile includes the above snippet, altering `/etc/passwd`'s file permissions, it’s possible to conduct the following:

Login to the container:

```
$ oc rsh test_container

```

Add a new root user (UID 0) to `/etc/passwd`:

```
$ echo test::0:0:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd

```

Switch to the new root user:

```
$ su test

```

Confirm UID is 0 and we are now root:

```
sh-4.2# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

If user namespaces were used within OpenShift the impact of this would be reduced as the user would only be root in a namespace separate from the host. However, in current OpenShift versions, we can confirm that the container process is in fact running as root (UID 0) both within the container *and* on the host.

If the `sleep` command is run within a container, on the node (or host) the process will look something similar to:

```
$ ps -o uid,uname,gid,cmd -C "sleep 10m"
UID        USER     GID   CMD
1000590000 1000590+ 0     sleep 1d

```

However, if the above technique is used and the same `sleep` is called, it can now be seen that the process is in fact running as root:

```
$ ps -o uid,uname,gid,cmd -C "sleep 10m"
 UID USER    GID   CMD
   0 root      0   sleep 10m

```
## Impact/Analysis

*When working with containers an important question to always ask is; Would you do this if you were installing the application on the host? If the answer is no, then it shouldn’t be done in a container either.*

Additionally, OpenShift (and likewise Kubernetes) does not currently support [user namespaces](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fcoreos.com%2Frkt%2Fdocs%2Flatest%2Fdevel%2Fuser-namespaces.html). What this means is that if a process is run as root from within a container, they have the equivalent permissions of root on the host.

**It’s not as bad as its sounds.**

By default OpenShift runs containers in a restricted [SCC profile](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.openshift.com%2Fcontainer-platform%2F4.3%2Fauthentication%2Fmanaging-security-context-constraints.html). Specifically this means that `SETUID` and `SETGID` are two systemcalls which are blocked in the container. This means that containers running with the restricted SCC cannot use these systemcalls to change their UID or GID and escalate their privileges. Furthermore, due to OpenShift employing a multi-layered approach to security (cgroups, SELinux, seccomp etc) it also restricts any attempts to access other containers or host resources (aka a full container escape).

However, it’s still not desirable as it unnecessarily increases the attack surface.

## Moving forward: How we are fixing it this:

The two main solutions for containers which require to get user information include:

1. Rely on CRI-O or
2. Use nss\_wrapper

The OpenShift run-time [CRI-O](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fcri-o%2Fcri-o%2Fpull%2F2022%2Fcommits%2F77408ef1490002e62c88baacc5c994e97aa793c6) (starting from OpenShift 4.2 onward) now inserts the random user for the container into `/etc/passwd`. Removing the requirement to insert the random user manually into `/etc/passwd` completely. Additionally in future versions of CRI-O, the `$HOME` or `$WORKDIR` of the container user will also be assigned, helping Java based images (thanks Akram - see [below](#Thanks)).

Given that support for versions before OpenShift 4.2 may also be required, nss\_wrapper can be utilized. This provides for a local, unprivileged passwd file to be specified, allowing the container to map the required user information to an random UID without having to modify the containers `/etc/passwd` file directly. A great example of this fix can be found in this [pull-request](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fopenshift%2Fjenkins%2Fpull%2F1024%2Ffiles%23).

Further container guidelines can also be found [here](https://access.redhat.com/bounce/?externalURL=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.openshift.com%2Fcontainer-platform%2F4.3%2Fopenshift_images%2Fcreate-images.html%23images-create-guide-openshift_create-images)

Product Security are working to fix the problem with our own containers and continuing to work with our engineers so that simple bugs like this don’t creep up in future. There are still a lot of containers to fix, but don’t worry we’re almost there:

## Thanks

To the original reporter: **Joseph LaMagna-Reiter (SPR Inc.)** and to **Akram Ben Aissi** from Red Hat for researching alternative methods.

Akram has also pointed out that for Java based processes, (until CRI-O is updated), -Duser.home is still required to be specified for compatibility.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534#c0)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-16 04:58:59 UTC  ``` A possible privilege escalation has been found in containers which modify the permissions of their local /etc/passwd.  Within a container by default a user is assigned to the root group:     sh-4.2$ id     uid=1001(default) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)  When this is combined with a loosening of permissions on /etc/passwd, it is possible for any user in the container to modify the passwd file and assume root.   For example: <https://github.com/operator-framework/presto/blob/master/Dockerfile.rhel#L75>     chmod -R 774 /etc/passwd $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts &&   To then add a new root user (in a contrived example):     oc rsh presto     echo test::0:0:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd     su test   Additionally, as a result of OpenShift not implementing user namespaces as of yet, if root is achieved in the container - root is technically achieved on the host.  It is our understanding that this chmod of /etc/passwd has have become necessary to support arbitrary user ids as per this document: <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images>  The document does state, "that there are no security concerns with this arrangement", however from the above example we can see that this is not true.   It should also be noted however, that containers in OpenShift do run under a restricted SCC context by default, with CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID both dropped. This increases the difficulty significantly to achieve access to the host directly. Even with protections like this (including SELinux), this technique provides a relatively easy first step in achieving a container escape and is still considered an escalation in privileges.   The following containers so far have been identified to modify /etc/passwd:  - hadoop  - hive  - jenkins-slave-base-rhel7  - openshift-enterprise-apb-base  - openshift-enterprise-apb  - openshift-enterprise-mediawiki  - openshift-enterprise-tests  - openshift-jenkins-2  - ose-metering-ansible-operator  - presto  - sso73-openshift   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534#c2)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-20 04:32:39 UTC  ``` Overall the following 17 OpenShift containers contain the incorrect /etc/passwd permissions (some are built from the same repo):  * hadoop-container * hive-container * jenkins-slave-base-rhel7-container * openshift-enterprise-ansible-operator-container * openshift-enterprise-ansible-service-broker-operator-container * openshift-enterprise-apb-base-container * openshift-enterprise-apb-tools-container * openshift-enterprise-mariadb-apb * openshift-enterprise-mediawiki-apb * openshift-enterprise-mediawiki-container * openshift-enterprise-mysql-apb * openshift-enterprise-postgresql-apb * openshift-enterprise-template-service-broker-operator-container * openshift-enterprise-tests-container * ose-metering-ansible-operator-container * presto-container  * openshift-istio-kiali-rhel7-operator-container   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534#c7)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 06:45:23 UTC  ``` Unembargoed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1793279#c0)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 04:21:51 UTC  ``` It has been found that multiple containers modify the permissions of /etc/passwd to make them modifiable by users other than root. An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this to modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges. This CVE is specific to the openshift/hive-container.  Original bug: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791534](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534 "CLOSED ERRATA - OpenShift: containers modify /etc/passwd group writable")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1793279#c1)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 04:21:53 UTC  ``` Statement:  By default this vulnerability is not exploitable in un-privilieged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform. This is because the system call SETUID and SETGID is blocked by the default seccomp policy.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1793279#c4)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-22 03:18:02 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joseph LaMagna-Reiter (SPR Inc.)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1793279#c6)  Mark Cooper    2020-02-28 02:27:35 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/articles/4859371>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1793282#c0)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 04:32:23 UTC  ``` It has been found that multiple containers modify the permissions of /etc/passwd to make them modifiable by users other than root. An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this to modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges. This CVE is specific to the openshift/jenkins-slave-base-rhel7-container  Original bug: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791534](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534 "CLOSED ERRATA - OpenShift: containers modify /etc/passwd group writable")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1793282#c1)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 04:32:25 UTC  ``` Statement:  By default this vulnerability is not exploitable in un-privilieged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform. This is because the system call SETUID and SETGID is blocked by the default seccomp policy.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1793282#c4)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-22 03:18:51 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joseph LaMagna-Reiter (SPR Inc.)   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1793282#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-02-25 05:54:21 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.3  Via RHSA-2020:0562 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:0562](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A0562)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1793282#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-02-25 09:49:39 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
