{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow leading to heap-buffer-overflow in the `sixel_decode_raw_impl` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-buffer-overflow due to an integer overflow when calculating the size for memory allocation, which leads to out-of-bounds write.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service if an attacker can control the size of the buffer to overwrite other memory regions. In this case, the process crashes due to the ASan detection of the overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted sixel image. The `img2sixel` command line tool is used to process the image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to supply a specially crafted sixel image file as input to the vulnerable program (`img2sixel`)."
