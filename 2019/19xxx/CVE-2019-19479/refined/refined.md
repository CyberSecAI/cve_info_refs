Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-19479:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect read operation in `libopensc/card-setcos.c` during the parsing of a SETCOS file attribute. Specifically, the code incorrectly calculates the index used to access data, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Incorrect Read Operation:** The code attempts to read data from a buffer using a flawed index calculation. The fix changes `iPinCount = iACLen - 1;` to `iPinCount = iACLen > 0 ? iACLen - 1 : 0;`, thus preventing a read of an out-of-bounds index when iACLen is 0.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially cause a crash or read sensitive information due to the incorrect read operation, which could potentially lead to a denial-of-service or data exposure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered when processing a specially crafted SETCOS file attribute. An attacker would need to provide a malicious smart card or a manipulated file with such data to exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be parsed by the vulnerable code. This could be through a malicious smart card, a manipulated SETCOS file or through another method that can inject the malformed input to the affected code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in OpenSC versions up to and including 0.19.0 and 0.20.x up to 0.20.0-rc3.
*   The fix is included in OpenSC version 0.20.0.
*   The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz.
*   The Red Hat Bugzilla entries also provide dependency information regarding affected and blocking bugs.
*   The Debian LTS entries confirm that this vulnerability was fixed in Debian 8 and 9.
