Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-19837:

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-19837 is related to a lack of access control on the web server of Ruckus access points, specifically within the `/web` directory. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to fetch any file within the `/web` directory, including symbolic links. This lack of access control is a crucial component in a chain of vulnerabilities that leads to remote code execution.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The web server configuration lacks access control for files within the `/web` directory. This means that any file, regardless of its extension, type or location pointed to by symlinks, can be fetched.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of access control mechanisms on the web server, allowing unauthenticated access to the `/web` directory and its contents.
- **Exposure of Symbolic Links:** The webserver follows symbolic links within `/web`, leading to exposure of sensitive files located outside the webroot.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files, such as configuration files, log files (including rpm.log), and files in /tmp such as rpmkey which contains the device's administrator credentials in plaintext.
- **Foundation for Further Attacks:** The ability to read arbitrary files is a crucial step in multiple attack chains, enabling command injection and stack overflow exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending unauthenticated HTTP GET requests to the web server, requesting the desired files from the `/web` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Ruckus access point's web interface.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without any prior authentication or authorization on the web interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It clearly outlines the vulnerability's root cause, the impact it has, and how it enables other attacks.
- The `/web` directory contained symbolic links to sensitive locations like `/tmp`, which contained files with cleartext administrative credentials, as well as configuration files.
- This vulnerability was a key component of a larger attack chain leading to remote code execution, highlighting its importance.
- The content also mentions that this vulnerability affects not only access points but also ZoneDirector 1200.
