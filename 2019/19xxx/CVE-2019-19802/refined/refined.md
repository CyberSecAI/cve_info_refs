Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the lack of privilege checks when an authenticated user connects to the Command Centre Server via the OPCUA protocol.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system fails to properly enforce privilege checks for OPCUA connections, allowing authenticated users to access all replicated data, regardless of their assigned privileges. This bypasses intended access restrictions.
- **Data Exposure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data replicated in a multi-server setup.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** An attacker with valid authentication credentials can gain access to a broad range of data that should be restricted based on their privileges.
- **Potential Data Breach:** The exposed data could include sensitive information, potentially leading to a data breach.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to connect to the Command Centre Server on port 4840 using the OPCUA protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the Command Centre system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network connectivity to the Command Centre Server to establish an OPCUA connection.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor has released maintenance releases to address this vulnerability in versions 8.10, 8.00, 7.90, and 7.80, with v7.70 and earlier also affected.
- Mitigation steps include limiting connections on port 4840 to authorized workstations and ensuring only trusted users have active operator accounts.
- This vulnerability impacts systems with multi-server setups.
