- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The plugin uses `is_admin()` to check for admin access but this function only checks if the admin panel is being displayed, not if the user has permission to access it. This, combined with a lack of capability checks on AJAX actions, allows any authenticated user (including subscribers) to access and modify redirect rules.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Authenticated Arbitrary Redirect Injection and Modification:** Any authenticated user can modify, delete, and inject redirect rules due to the lack of proper capability checks on AJAX actions.
    - **Reflected XSS:** The ID parameter used for creating and identifying rules lacks input validation and sanitization, resulting in a reflected XSS vulnerability.
    - **CSRF:**  The plugin does not use a nonce for AJAX actions modifying or creating rules, leading to CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers can redirect site traffic to malicious sites.
    - Phishing pages and malware distribution through redirection.
    - Complete loss of site availability if redirects are set improperly.
    - XSS can be used to further compromise the site
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Network access via HTTP requests on the vulnerable WordPress site.
    - Exploiting unprotected AJAX actions.
    - CSRF via social engineering (if subscriber access is not available to the attacker)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WordPress site (at least a subscriber).
    - If subscriber access is not available, CSRF can be exploited, requiring the attacker to trick an authenticated user into performing malicious actions.
