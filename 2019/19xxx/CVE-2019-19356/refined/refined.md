{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the 'tracert' command implementation within the NETIS router's web management interface. Specifically, the lack of proper input sanitization allows for OS command injection via the '|' operator.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection",
      "Insufficient Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) as root on the vulnerable NETIS router.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by sending a specially crafted 'tracert' request to the router's web management page.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be authenticated to the router's web management interface. This may involve bypassing authentication mechanisms or using default/weak passwords."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The exploit is demonstrated in a python script. The vulnerability is present in at least firmware versions V1.2.31805 and V2.2.36123, and possibly other versions or models. The vulnerability is triggered when an authenticated user is able to perform OS commands such as `ping` or `tracert`. While the `ping` command is sanitized, the `tracert` command isn't. By injecting `|`, the attacker can use `tracert` to execute commands, including `ls`, which is shown in the github writeup.",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2019-19356"
