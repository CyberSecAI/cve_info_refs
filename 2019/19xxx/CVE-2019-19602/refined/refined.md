Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19602:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an incorrect caching mechanism for the `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx` variable within the Linux kernel's FPU (Floating Point Unit) management. This variable tracks the current owner of the FPU. The kernel used `this_cpu_read_stable` to access `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx`.  However, after the implementation of deferred FPU register loading, `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx` can change during preemption and caching the value becomes problematic.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect caching:** The use of `this_cpu_read_stable` resulted in the value of `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx` being cached, and this cached value might become stale due to task preemption. This stale value could lead to incorrect FPU state validation.
- **Race condition:** The vulnerability arises because the FPU owner context can change during preemption. The cached value of `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx` might be from a different task than the current one, resulting in incorrect FPU state usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **FPU register corruption:** The primary impact is corruption of FPU registers. When the stale owner context is used, the FPU state might be loaded from the wrong task. This leads to unpredictable behavior and data corruption when the FPU state is copied into a signal frame. The vulnerability can cause application crashes, data corruption, and potentially allow for privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Signal handling:** The vulnerability is triggered during signal delivery and the saving/restoring of the FPU state. When a signal is delivered to a process, the kernel might fault in user stack pages in order to XSAVE the signal context. The corruption occurs during the FPU state save/restore within the `copy_fpstate_to_sigframe()` function, after deferred FPU register loading was implemented.
- **Preemption:** Task preemption is also a critical condition for this to be exploitable. The vulnerability manifests when another task uses the FPU, changes the `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx`, and then the original task resumes and attempts to use the cached, stale FPU context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Local user access:** A local attacker, meaning a user capable of executing code on the system, is required. 
- **Ability to trigger signals and preemption:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger signals to the target process (e.g. through multiple threads or by sending signals directly) in combination with heavy FPU usage and possibly memory pressure in order to cause a context switch and preemption that could lead to race condition.

**Additional notes:**
- **Compiler optimization dependency:** The vulnerability is more likely to manifest when the kernel is compiled with GCC 9. This compiler version aggressively caches the value of `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx`, exacerbating the issue. GCC 8 and earlier do not exhibit this caching, so the issue might not manifest with those compilers.
- **Patch:** The fix involves changing `this_cpu_read_stable` to `this_cpu_read` in the `fpregs_state_valid` function within `arch/x86/include/asm/fpu/internal.h`. The change forces the FPU owner to be read again every time, preventing the race condition due to stale cached value of `fpu_fpregs_owner_ctx`
- **Go programming language:** The issue was initially discovered as memory corruption in the Go programming language and then narrowed down to this kernel bug.

The provided content gives more technical details than the official CVE description which simply states:

> It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel on x86 platforms when keeping track of which process was assigned control of the FPU. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain administrative privileges.
