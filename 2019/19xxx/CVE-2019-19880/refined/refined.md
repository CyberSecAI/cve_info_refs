{
  "CVE-2019-19880": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to mishandling of constant integer values in ORDER BY clauses of window definitions in SQLite's `exprListAppendList` function, leading to an invalid pointer dereference if the expression is duplicated.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Invalid pointer dereference"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation could cause a denial of service by crashing the application using the vulnerable version of SQLite, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specifically crafted SQL queries that include `SELECT DISTINCT` with `LEFT JOIN`, where the right-hand side is a view.",
       "Mishandling of certain queries."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to be able to supply the specifically crafted SQL queries and/or archive to trigger the vulnerability."
  }
