- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `stbi__load_main` function within the `stb_image.h` library. Specifically, it occurs when processing a crafted TGA image.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to insufficient bounds checking when processing the crafted TGA image, specifically when copying image data using `memcpy`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could lead to a denial-of-service (application crash) and potentially arbitrary code execution, depending on the platform, memory layout and exploitation techniques employed.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted TGA image file to the `img2sixel` tool.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious image file, which then gets processed by the vulnerable `img2sixel` utility.
