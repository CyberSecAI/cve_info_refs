**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

   * **Root Cause:**
        - The vulnerability stems from the fact that sudo through 1.8.29 does not validate if a provided numeric user ID (UID) exists. It allows an attacker with a `Runas ALL` sudoer account to impersonate a nonexistent user by specifying such a UID.
        - In addition, the vulnerability stems from the fact that sudo versions before 1.8.30 did not prevent access to blocked users who can login using methods other than a password.
       - Specifically, using a numeric UID that has no associated user.

   * **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
        - Lack of proper validation of user IDs when a numeric UID is passed to sudo.
        - Failure to consider account blocking when determining if impersonation via sudo should be allowed.
        - The ability to impersonate a non-existent user.

   * **Impact of Exploitation:**
        - An attacker with `Runas ALL` sudoer privileges could impersonate a non-existent user, potentially gaining unauthorized access or modifying data.
        - The attacker can bypass the restrictions put in place for a user via the shadow file by specifying a non-existent user.

   * **Attack Vectors:**
        - Local attack, specifically via the command line interface.

   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        - The attacker needs to have access to a sudoer account configured with `Runas ALL` to be able to specify any user as target for a command.

**3. Additional Details Beyond CVE Description**

   - Several sources note that the software maintainers consider this *not a vulnerability* because running as a user not in the local password database or as a user who is blocked, is by design. However, the behavior was changed in sudo 1.8.30 to disable this functionality by default as some users found the behavior unexpected.
   - Fixes involve:
        - Updating sudo to version 1.8.30 or later to have a configuration option.
        - Updating sudo to a version which properly validates UIDs and user existence..
   - Some sources mention the vulnerability affects other products, which also need to be patched to prevent exploitation.
        - NetApp Cloud Backup, NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node.
        - Oracle Solaris.
        - Wind River Linux.
        - macOS

**4. Summary**

The extracted information indicates that CVE-2019-19232 is a flaw in sudo's user impersonation handling, where an attacker with `Runas ALL` privileges could run commands as non-existent or blocked users by supplying a non-existing numeric UID. While not considered a flaw by the maintainers, it's been treated as a vulnerability due to unexpected behavior and has been addressed in newer versions of sudo via added restrictions and additional configuration.
