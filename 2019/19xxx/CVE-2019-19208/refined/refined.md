{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization during the installation process. Specifically, the 'timezone' parameter in the POST request to '/components/install/process.php' is not sanitized before being written to a PHP configuration file. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "PHP Code Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code, leading to remote code execution (RCE) on the server. This can result in complete compromise of the affected system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker sends a crafted POST request to the '/components/install/process.php' endpoint, injecting malicious PHP code into the 'timezone' parameter." ,
       "After the initial payload is sent, subsequent GET requests to config.php with a 'cmd' parameter allow for persistent command execution."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Codiad server. No authentication is required for the initial exploit."
