## Reflected XSS in Hero Maps Premium WordPress Plugin (<= v.2.2.1)

2020-02-25

### Background

The Hero Maps Premium plugin for WordPress was prone to multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities because it did not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. An attacker may leverage this issue
to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site. This may allow the attacker to steal cookie-based authentication credentials or launch other attacks.
The issues were corrected and a patch was made available (v.2.2.3).

Download Link: [Hero Maps Premium](https://heroplugins.com/product/maps/)

Vulnerable versions: v.2.2.1 and prior.

Googledork: 'inurl:/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem'

#### Vulnerability - Unauthenticated Reflected XSS (CVE-2019-19134)

Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities were identified in publicly-exposed endpoints of WordPress sites loaded with the Hero Maps Premium plugin. In each case, the application accepted input as
HTTP parameters, which it later returned within the page as HTML or JavaScript. Multiple pages and parameters were susceptible to this attack.

#### Steps:

1. Locate a WordPress instance with Hero Maps Premium (v.2.2.1 or prior) installed (hxxp://wordpress.example.com).
2. Within a browser, navigate to the following URL: hxxp://wordpress.example.com/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/views/dashboard/index.php?p=/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/foo%22%3E%3Csvg//onload=%22alert(%27XSS%20in%20Hero%20Maps%20Premium%202.1.6%27)%22%3E
3. Observe that the "p" parameter from the URL was passed directly into the page without sanitization - "><svg//onload="alert('XSS in Hero Maps Premium').
   Observe that the SVG element is interpreted as a HTML element and that the associated JavaScript event handler executes within the context of the victimâ€™s browser.

#### Testing Conditions:

* Firefox v73.0.1
* WordPress 5.2.1

The Hero Maps developer's professionalism and willingness to fix the issues were second to none. Upon notification, they worked to fully resolve the XSS issues and protect the Hero Maps users.

### Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

Hooper Labs takes security issues seriously. We believe in working with relevant stakeholders to achieve coordinated disclosure within a reasonable period of time.
We also adhere to the industry-standard 90-day disclosure deadline, where vendors are notified of vulnerabilities immediately, with details shared to the public after
90 days (or sooner if the issues are resolved earlier).

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) are an industry standard for identifying vulnerabilities [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures). This system is a method for reference and tracking of publicly-known exposures. A CVE is a way to uniquely reference vulnerabilities across systems and Mitre
Corporation is the primary CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) for the program. We believe that users have a right to know their exposures in order to make informed risk decisions.

Hooper Labs does not participate in bug bounty programs, but instead relies on responsible disclosure [(link)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure).
Effectively communicating vulnerabilities and risks to the vendor, users, and public ensure that risk can be documented, calculated, and mitigated. We hope that through this
process the Information Domain may be marginally safer.
