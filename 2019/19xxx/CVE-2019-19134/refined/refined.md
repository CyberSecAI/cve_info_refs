Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19134:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The Hero Maps Premium WordPress plugin did not sufficiently sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the plugin was vulnerable to reflected XSS due to the lack of sanitization of HTTP parameters, which were directly rendered in the HTML or Javascript of the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Multiple reflected XSS vulnerabilities were present in publicly accessible endpoints. The application accepted user-controlled input via HTTP parameters and displayed this input directly in the HTML or JavaScript of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a user visiting the affected site.
*   **Cookie Theft:** This can be leveraged to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Further Attacks:** The attacker could perform other malicious actions on behalf of the victim, depending on the access rights of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Parameters:** The primary attack vector was through crafted HTTP GET parameters.  Specifically, the `p` parameter in `wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/views/dashboard/index.php` was vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Publicly Accessible WordPress Instance:** The attacker needs to target a WordPress site that is publicly accessible and has the vulnerable version of the Hero Maps Premium plugin installed.
*   **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL, including the XSS payload, and induce a victim to visit the crafted link.
*  **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability is unauthenticated.

**Additional Details:**
*   The specific vulnerable versions were v2.2.1 and prior.
*   The patch for this vulnerability was released in version 2.2.3.
*   The exploit example provided in the content shows how the "p" parameter is used to inject a payload of `"><svg//onload="alert('XSS in Hero Maps Premium').` which executes Javascript code.
*   The vulnerability exists in the file path:  `/wp-content/plugins/hmapsprem/views/dashboard/index.php`
