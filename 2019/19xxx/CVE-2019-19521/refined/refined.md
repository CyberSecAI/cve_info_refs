{
  "CVE-2019-19521": {
    "Root cause": "Insufficient input validation in the libc authentication layer.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The `login_style` program, used for various authentication styles, accepts usernames in the form of `-option`, allowing attackers to influence its behavior.",
      "The `login_passwd` program interprets usernames starting with `-s` as options, specifically, `-schallenge` causes it to automatically report a successful authentication, bypassing password checks."
    ],
    "Impact": "Authentication bypass. An attacker can gain unauthorized access to vulnerable services without valid credentials.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation in smtpd, ldapd, and radiusd by providing a crafted username.",
       "Local exploitation via `su` to bypass authentication (although this leads to a crash due to NULL pointer dereference)."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Ability to connect to the vulnerable service (e.g., smtpd, ldapd, radiusd) and provide a crafted username in the authentication process."
    ]
  }
