Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19791:

*   **Vulnerability:** Improper input validation. Specifically, when using Apache access rules to protect SOAP/REST endpoints in LemonLDAP::NG, the rules are not fully effective due to a rewrite rule.

*   **Root Cause:** The rewrite rule `RewriteRule "^/(.+)$" "/index.fcgi/$1" [PT]`  allows bypassing of the intended access restrictions.  While a rule might block `/sessions`, an attacker could still access the endpoint via `/index.fcgi/sessions` or `/index.fcgi/index.fcgi/sessions`, etc. because the rewrite rule is applied before the access control.

*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a URL with repeated `/index.fcgi` prefixes before the target endpoint (e.g., `/index.fcgi/index.fcgi/sessions`), an attacker can bypass the intended Apache access rules.

*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to SOAP/REST endpoints, potentially leading to information disclosure or other security breaches, depending on the function of the accessed endpoints.

*   **Affected Component:** Apache access rules in LemonLDAP::NG when used to protect SOAP/REST endpoints.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LemonLDAP::NG protected resource and understand the URL structure.

*   **Severity:** Medium
