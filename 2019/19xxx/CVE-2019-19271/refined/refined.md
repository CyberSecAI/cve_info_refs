Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `tls_verify_crl()` function within the `mod_tls` module of ProFTPD. Specifically, it uses an incorrect iteration variable `i` instead of `j` when accessing revoked certificate entries within a Certificate Revocation List (CRL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Iteration Variable:** The code iterates through the revoked certificates in a CRL using a `for` loop with the variable `j`. However, it incorrectly uses the variable `i` (which is not defined in the scope of the loop and refers to the outer loop) to access the revoked certificate entries using `sk_X509_REVOKED_value()`. This results in accessing incorrect or out-of-bounds memory locations.
- **CRL Entry Ignored:** Due to the incorrect index, the function potentially fails to check all revoked certificates within the CRL. This means some revoked certificates may be missed, and thus, the server might incorrectly accept connections using a revoked certificate.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass Certificate Revocation:** A client using a revoked certificate could potentially connect to the ProFTPD server, bypassing the intended security measure of certificate revocation.
- **Security Breach:** This could allow unauthorized access and potentially lead to a security breach if the revoked certificate was compromised.
- **Loss of trust:** Clients connecting to the server might not be warned about the revoked status of the certificates, leading to a loss of trust and a false sense of security.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:**  An attacker could use a revoked certificate obtained from a compromised source, and connect to the server without any warnings or checks, which is how a man-in-the-middle can perform a successful attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Compromised/Revoked Certificate:** The attacker needs to possess a certificate that has been revoked by the Certificate Authority (CA) and included in the CRL.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the ProFTPD server to establish a connection.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability exists in ProFTPD versions prior to 1.3.6.
- The issue was identified when comparing the code differences between version 1.3.5 and 1.3.6.
- The fix involves correcting the usage of the iteration variable, using `j` instead of `i` within the `sk_X509_REVOKED_value()` function call.
- The reporter mentions that the issue was not apparent in their 2018 testing because the CRLs they used only revoked a single certificate, and the incorrect index was not relevant in those cases.
- The reporter also highlights that stunnel switched to relying on OpenSSL's built-in CRL handling to avoid these types of issues.
- This issue is the third of four bugs in the same function, indicating a recurring problem with the custom CRL handling code in ProFTPD.
- The lack of fixes in ProFTPD highlights a lack of attention to security issues related to TLS CRL handling in this product.
