Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-19985:

**Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated File Download w/ Information Disclosure

*   **Root Cause:** The plugin allowed unauthenticated users to trigger the export of subscriber lists. The plugin did not implement proper access controls to verify if the user had the authorization to perform this export.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of access control: No check was made to verify user authorization before exporting subscriber data.
    *   Direct access to export functionality: The export functionality could be triggered using specific query variables without authentication.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive user data, including first names, last names, email addresses, and mailing list memberships.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a request with specific query variables (`status` and `report`) to initiate the export function without authentication.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:** No special capabilities or position needed, an unauthenticated user could exploit the vulnerability.
