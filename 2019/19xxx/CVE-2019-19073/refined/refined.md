Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-19073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a memory leak within the `ath9k/htc_hst.c` driver. Specifically, the `htc_config_pipe_credits()`, `htc_setup_complete()`, and `htc_connect_service()` functions fail to properly release allocated memory (sk\_buff) when a timeout occurs while waiting for a completion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leak:**  The vulnerability is a classic memory leak. When specific functions in the `ath9k/htc_hst.c` driver time out, allocated memory isn't freed, causing memory to accumulate over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service due to memory exhaustion. By repeatedly triggering the timeout condition, an attacker can cause the system to consume memory until it becomes unresponsive or crashes due to lack of available memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local:** The attacker must have local access to the system, often with capabilities to load modules.
*   **Triggering Timeouts:** The vulnerability is triggered by a timeout condition in the `htc_config_pipe_credits()`, `htc_setup_complete()`, and `htc_connect_service()` functions.  These timeouts are related to device initialization and USB probing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system and the ability to load kernel modules.
*   **Module Loading:**  The attacker needs to be able to load and unload the ath9k module to continuously exploit the leak. The vulnerability can be triggered by unloading/loading the module, it isn't triggered by just re-attaching the device with an existing module.
*   **Device interaction**: The vulnerability involves issues related to device probing and connection. The attacker would need to interact with the wireless device to trigger the timeout conditions.
*  **Note**: Some sources dispute the practical implications of this vulnerability due to the need for administrative level privileges and the limited scope of the memory leak. However, an accumulation of small memory leaks can lead to a denial of service, especially when combined with methods of repeatedly triggering module loading and connection attempts.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content from `github.com` confirms that the fix involves releasing the allocated buffer (skb) when a timeout occurs.
*   The Suse advisory indicates that they rated this as moderate and that the attacker would require high privileges on the machine.
*   The Red Hat bugzilla entry confirms the vulnerability is a memory leak in the atheros wireless module and that the fix was released in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 errata.
*   The Netapp advisory lists CVE-2019-19073 as one of many vulnerabilities affecting their products that use Linux Kernel.
*   The Ubuntu advisory lists CVE-2019-19073 and CVE-2019-19074 as denial of service issues caused by improper memory deallocation in the Atheros HTC based wireless driver.
*   The Debian LTS advisory describes the vulnerability as potential memory leaks in the ath9k and ath9k_htc drivers.
*   The opensuse mailing list notes the vulnerability and links to the SUSE advisories, noting it is related to the `ath9k/htc_hst.c` driver, and that the fixed kernel version is `4.12.14-lp151.28.36.1`

In summary, CVE-2019-19073 describes a memory leak in the ath9k driver that could allow a local privileged attacker to cause a denial of service.
