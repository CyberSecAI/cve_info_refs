Based on the provided content, here's information related to CVE-2019-19890:

*   **Vulnerability:** The Humax HGB10R-2 router transmits admin credentials in cleartext using HTTP Basic Authentication.
*   **Root Cause:** The router's web interface uses HTTP Basic Authentication over an unencrypted HTTP connection. This results in the credentials being Base64 encoded, but not encrypted, during transmission.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker on the same network as the router can capture HTTP traffic using a tool like Wireshark. By examining the captured packets, the attacker can extract the Base64-encoded credentials from the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request. The attacker can then decode the Base64 string to obtain the plaintext username and password.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to gain administrative access to the router. This access could be used to change router settings, monitor network traffic, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the router or be able to intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the router. They also need to be able to use a packet capture tool like Wireshark and have a basic understanding of HTTP and Base64 encoding.
