- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a result of insufficient named pipe client verification, bypassable named pipe communication obfuscation, and incomplete mitigations in the CreateDirectory component of the EA Origin client.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insufficient named pipe client verification: The service verifies the client's executable file instead of its in-memory process, which can be different due to DLL injection.
    - Bypassable named pipe communication obfuscation: Data transmitted over the named pipe is encrypted with a static key, which can be bypassed by hooking the EVP_EncryptUpdate function of libeay32.dll.
    - Incomplete mitigations in CreateDirectory: The service has a blacklist to prevent DACL changes on protected files/directories, but this can be bypassed using hardlinks or different path separators.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Local privilege escalation by manipulating DACLs of arbitrary files and directories, leading to the ability to execute code with SYSTEM privileges.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - DLL injection into the Origin.exe process to bypass the named pipe client verification.
    - Hooking the EVP_EncryptUpdate function to modify commands transmitted over the named pipe.
    - Using the CreateDirectory command to manipulate DACLs, potentially bypassing the blacklist using hardlinks or different path separators to modify DACLs of arbitrary files and directories.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the system.
    - Ability to inject DLLs into running processes.
    - Ability to hook function calls within a process.
    - Ability to use the Origin client (specifically triggering a `CreateDirectory` command) or craft a custom client.
