Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-19335:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The `openshift-install` command-line tool, used during the installation of an OpenShift 4 cluster, creates an `auth` directory containing `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin-password` files. These files contain credentials for authenticating to the OpenShift API server.
- The tool incorrectly assigns world-readable permissions (specifically `-rw-r--r--`) to these sensitive files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the world-readable permission assigned to `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin-password` files. This allows any user on the system to read these files.
- **Exposure of Credentials:** The files contain sensitive credentials, allowing unauthorized access to the OpenShift API server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized API Access:** A local attacker who gains access to the machine could read the `kubeconfig` and `kubeadmin-password` files to access the OpenShift API, potentially leading to control over the cluster.
- **Compromise of Cluster:** Access to the API would allow the attacker to manipulate resources within the cluster, potentially causing data breaches, service disruptions, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the system where the `openshift-install` command was executed and has generated the vulnerable files.
- **File System Access:** The attacker gains access by reading the vulnerable files from the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User:** The attacker must have local access to the system on which the `openshift-install` command was run and have the ability to read files from the file system.
- **No Root Required:** The attacker does not require root privileges to read the files, as the files are world-readable.

**Additional Details from Content:**

- The `oc` command-line tool, in contrast, creates configuration files with secure permissions, only readable by the current user (`-rw-------`).
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.2 via errata RHSA-2020:0463 and RHSA-2020:0476.
- The bug report indicates this vulnerability was assigned a "low" priority and "low" severity rating.
