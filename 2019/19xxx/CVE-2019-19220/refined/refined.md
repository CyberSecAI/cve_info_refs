**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-19220
**Advisory ID:** usd-2019-0064
**Affected Product:** Control-M/Agent
**Affected Version:** 7.0.00.000
**Vulnerability Type:** OS Command Injection
**Security Risk:** High (conditional)

**Vulnerability Details:**
- An OS Command Injection vulnerability exists in the communication between Control-M/Agent and Control-M/Server when using the TCP protocol.
- The vulnerability is triggered when handling output with an unsupported action.
- Exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution with the privileges of the Control-M/Agent.
- The advisory highlights that in real-life configurations, the agent was sometimes configured to run with root privileges, despite the vendor's recommendation to run it as a non-root user.
- The vulnerability is less severe when TLS is enabled, but the advisory notes encountering configurations where TLS was disabled, increasing the criticality of the vulnerability in such cases.

**Attack Vector:**
- The attack occurs during communication between Control-M/Agent and Control-M/Server using the TCP protocol.
- It involves handling output with an unsupported action, leading to OS Command Injection.

**Impact:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution.
- The attacker gains the privileges of the Control-M/Agent, which in some cases might be root.

**Mitigation:**
- The vendor's fix involves filtering and validating user-supplied data.
