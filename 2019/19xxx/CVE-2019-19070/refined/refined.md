```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A memory leak occurs in the `spi_gpio_probe()` function within `drivers/spi/spi-gpio.c` of the Linux kernel.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak due to a failure path not properly releasing allocated resources."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by consuming memory through repeated triggering of the vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by causing failures within the `devm_add_action_or_reset()` function during the driver probe process.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to cause a `devm_add_action_or_reset()` failure, likely by manipulating device configuration or triggering resource allocation issues.",
     "additional_details": "The `spi_gpio_probe()` function allocates an SPI master using `spi_alloc_master`. If `devm_add_action_or_reset` fails after this allocation, the allocated `master` is not released, resulting in a memory leak. The fix ensures that `spi_master_put(master)` is called in case of failure to prevent the leak."
