- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in several search fields, leading to a reflected XSS vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites when a user interacts with the manipulated application.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through the search functionality of the application. An attacker would need to craft a malicious input string containing JavaScript and then have a user submit it to the vulnerable search field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious string that will be reflected in the search results. The user needs to be tricked into submitting the malicious input or visiting a URL that triggers the injection.
