{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The comment field for special orders in Matrix42 Workspace Management is vulnerable to stored XSS.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the comment field, which will be executed when a privileged user (e.g., manager or admin) views the order. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves intercepting and modifying the HTTP request made by the web application when placing a special order to include malicious JavaScript code in the comment field.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the web application's requests. The attacker would need a valid user account with the ability to place special orders."
