Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19460:

**CVE-2019-19460:**

*   **Root Cause:** The SALTO ProAccess SPACE web server runs as a Windows service with SYSTEM privileges by default. This violates the principle of least privilege.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is the webserver running with SYSTEM privileges, which amplifies the impact of other vulnerabilities like path traversal and arbitrary file write.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker exploiting path traversal or arbitrary file write vulnerabilities gains the ability to write to any location on the filesystem, due to the SYSTEM privileges of the web server.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server by writing malicious files (e.g. batch files in autostart).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploitation of path traversal vulnerability.
    *   Exploitation of arbitrary file write vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to authenticate to the SALTO ProAccess SPACE web application.
    *   The attacker needs to exploit other vulnerabilities (path traversal or arbitrary file write) to gain full control.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided document also details other vulnerabilities within the same software (CVE-2019-19457, CVE-2019-19458, CVE-2019-19459), as well as authorization issues and cleartext transmission of data.
*   It provides specific proof of concept examples for exploiting the file write and traversal issues.
