The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in Centreon 19.04, specifically mentioning CVE-2019-19487 along with CVE-2019-19484 and CVE-2019-19486. It focuses on a URL redirect vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application uses a parameter "p" in the login process that persists after successful login, allowing an attacker to manipulate the redirect.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unvalidated URL parameter in the login process.
- The "p" parameter is not cleared after login and remains in the URL, potentially allowing for redirection to an attacker-controlled site.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the URL redirect can be leveraged in phishing attacks, where a user might be redirected to a malicious website disguised as the legitimate login page.
- The attacker can potentially steal user credentials, install malware, or perform other malicious actions on the user's browser/machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with the "p" parameter set to a different domain, an attacker can redirect a user after a legitimate login, tricking them into accessing malicious content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to trick the user to click on a specially crafted link containing the malicious URL redirect in the "p" parameter.
- No prior authentication is needed, the user only need to login.
