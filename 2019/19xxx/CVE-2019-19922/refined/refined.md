{
  "CVE-2019-19922": {
    "description": "In some situations, the fair scheduler in the Linux kernel did not permit a process to use its full quota time slice. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service.",
    "root_cause": "A change in Linux 3.16.61, 'sched/fair: Fix bandwidth timer clock drift condition', could lead to tasks being throttled before using their full quota of CPU time due to expiration of cpu-local slices.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect calculation of CPU time quota",
      "Unnecessary throttling of tasks",
    ],
     "impact": "Local attacker can cause denial of service by preventing processes from using their full allocated CPU quota, leading to reduced performance.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Local attacker with the ability to schedule processes."
