{
  "CVE-2019-19064": {
    "Description": "A memory leak in the fsl_lpspi_probe() function in drivers/spi/spi-fsl-lpspi.c in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering pm_runtime_get_sync() failures.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `fsl_lpspi_probe()` function in the Linux kernel's SPI subsystem fails to properly handle errors during runtime power management initialization, specifically when `pm_runtime_get_sync()` fails. When this function fails, the allocated SPI controller is not released, leading to a memory leak.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Memory leak"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial of service due to memory exhaustion. Repeated failures of `pm_runtime_get_sync()` could lead to the system running out of memory and potentially crashing.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves triggering the `fsl_lpspi_probe()` function in such a way that `pm_runtime_get_sync()` fails, for example, by causing an error in clock enablement at runtime resume.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the capability to load the affected driver or trigger the specific code path. The vulnerability is triggered during device probe, implying the attacker needs a position or capabilities to influence loading the driver."
