Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19059:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple memory leaks within the `iwl_pcie_ctxt_info_gen3_init()` function located in `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/pcie/ctxt-info-gen3.c` of the Linux kernel. Specifically, allocated DMA memory for `prph_scratch`, `prph_info`, and `ctxt_info_gen3` is not properly released in certain error cases during initialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Leaks:** The core issue is the failure to free allocated memory when errors occur during the initialization process. This leads to memory leaks over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path, an attacker can exhaust system memory, leading to a denial of service. The system may become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is local. This means an attacker would need to have a position on the system to trigger the vulnerability, potentially via a user interacting with a vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable Intel Wi-Fi driver to trigger the memory leaks. This likely requires the capability to load the relevant kernel module, or to interact with the affected WiFi device.

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Patch:** The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring that the allocated memory for `prph_scratch`, `prph_info` and `ctxt_info_gen3` is freed in all error cases within `iwl_pcie_ctxt_info_gen3_init`. The fix adds a `goto` and corresponding error handling blocks to release the memory.
*   **Affected Devices:** The vulnerability specifically affects Intel Wi-Fi devices using the `iwlwifi` driver.
*   **Specific Commit:** The commit fixing this vulnerability is [0f4f199443faca715523b0659aa536251d8b978f](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/0f4f199443faca715523b0659aa536251d8b978f) in the Linux kernel.
*   **Severity:** While some sources mark this as high, RedHat considers this a low severity issue due to the need to have physical access to trigger the error and the low impact it has on confidentiality or integrity.
*   **Mitigation:** One mitigation involves blacklisting the `rtl8192cu` module, preventing the vulnerable code from being loaded.
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affected various products incorporating the Linux kernel, including Fedora, Ubuntu, and NetApp products. Specific affected versions are listed in the provided content.
