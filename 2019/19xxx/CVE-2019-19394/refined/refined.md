Root cause of vulnerability: The Mission Portal web interface was vulnerable to Javascript injection.
Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when displaying information related to hosts in the Mission Portal web interface, which leads to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
Impact of exploitation: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the web interface, which could then be executed in the browsers of other users who accessed the affected pages. This could lead to the attacker gaining control of other users' sessions or performing actions on their behalf.
Attack vectors: An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code into the system via a host which then is rendered in the Mission Portal web interface.
Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker would need to have the ability to affect the state of a host, and have a user view the affected page on the Mission Portal.
