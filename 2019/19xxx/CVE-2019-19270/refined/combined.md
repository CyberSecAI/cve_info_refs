An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for proftpd fixes the following issues:
\* GeoIP has been discontinued by Maxmind (boo#1156210) This update removes
module build for geoip see
<https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-legacy-discontinuation-notice/>
- CVE-2019-19269: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference may occur when
validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server
(boo#1157803)
- CVE-2019-19270: Fixed a Failure to check for the appropriate field of a
CRL entry prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account
(boo#1157798)
- CVE-2019-18217: Fixed remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to
incorrect handling of overly long commands (boo#1154600 gh#846)
Update to 1.3.6b
\* Fixed pre-authentication remote denial-of-service issue (Issue #846).
\* Backported fix for building mod\_sql\_mysql using MySQL 8 (Issue #824).
Update to 1.3.6a:
\* Fixed symlink navigation (Bug#4332).
\* Fixed building of mod\_sftp using OpenSSL 1.1.x releases (Issue#674).
\* Fixed SITE COPY honoring of <Limit> restrictions (Bug#4372).
\* Fixed segfault on login when using mod\_sftp + mod\_sftp\_pam (Issue#656).
\* Fixed restarts when using mod\_facl as a static module
\* Add missing Requires(pre): group(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Add missing Requires(pre): user(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Use pam\_keyinit.so (boo#1144056)
- Reduce hard dependency on systemd to only that which is necessary for
building and installation.
update to 1.3.6:
\* Support for using Redis for caching, logging; see the
doc/howto/Redis.html documentation.
\* Fixed mod\_sql\_postgres SSL support (Issue #415).
\* Support building against LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL (Issue #361).
\* Better support on AIX for login restraictions (Bug #4285).
\* TimeoutLogin (and other timeouts) were not working properly for SFTP
connections (Bug#4299).
\* Handling of the SIGILL and SIGINT signals, by the daemon process, now
causes the child processes to be terminated as well (Issue #461).
\* RPM .spec file naming changed to conform to Fedora guidelines.
\* Fix for "AllowChrootSymlinks off" checking each component for symlinks
(CVE-2017-7418).
New Modules:
\* mod\_redis, mod\_tls\_redis, mod\_wrap2\_redis With Redis now supported as a
caching mechanism, similar to Memcache, there are now Redis-using
modules: mod\_redis (for configuring the Redis connection information),
mod\_tls\_redis (for caching SSL sessions and OCSP information using
Redis), and mod\_wrap2\_redis (for using ACLs stored in Redis).
Changed Modules:
\* mod\_ban: The mod\_ban module's BanCache directive can now use Redis-based
caching; see doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanCache.
-New Configuration Directives
\* SQLPasswordArgon2, SQLPasswordScrypt
The key lengths for Argon2 and Scrypt-based passwords are now
configurable via these new directives; previously, the key length had been
hardcoded to be 32 bytes, which is not interoperable with all other
implementations (Issue #454).
Changed Configuration Directives
\* AllowChrootSymlinks When "AllowChrootSymlinks off" was used, only the
last portion of the DefaultRoot path would be checked to see if it was a
symlink. Now, each component of the DefaultRoot path will be checked to
see if it is a symlink when "AllowChrootSymlinks off" is used.
\* Include The Include directive can now be used within a <Limit> section,
e.g.: <Limit LOGIN> Include /path/to/allowed.txt DenyAll </Limit> API
Changes
\* A new JSON API has been added, for use by third-party modules.

## Description

![@debrouxl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8375?v=4&size=48)[debrouxl](https://github.com/debrouxl)opened [on Nov 4, 2019](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/859#issue-517251790)

This is the 2nd of 4 bugs in the tls\_verify\_crl() function. The code fails to perform a CRL lookup by issuer (as the comment right above the block states), it instead performs a second lookup by subject. As a result, in our tests, after crash bugs 1 and 4 (issue [#858](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/858) and issue [#861](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/861)) were fixed, ProFTPD still failed to take into account a valid CRL and break a connection.

The patch is as follows:

```
@@ -5982,11 +5990,11 @@
   /* Try to retrieve a CRL corresponding to the _issuer_ of
    * the current certificate in order to check for revocation.
    */

 #if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10100000L
-  crls = X509_STORE_CTX_get1_crls(store_ctx, subject);
+  crls = X509_STORE_CTX_get1_crls(store_ctx, issuer);
 #elif OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10000000L
-  crls = X509_STORE_get1_crls(store_ctx, subject);
+  crls = X509_STORE_get1_crls(store_ctx, issuer);
 #else
   /* Your OpenSSL is before 1.0.0.  You really need to upgrade. */
   crls = NULL;

```

At least two other pieces of similar code, which contain the same comment as this one, are getting it right:

<https://github.com/CESNET/libnetconf2/blob/master/src/session_server_tls.c>

<https://github.com/copiousfreetime/stunnel/blob/master/src/verify.c> (outdated stunnel < 5.24)

FWIW, 4 years ago, stunnel got rid of custom CRL handling code and started relying on OpenSSL's built-in handling instead. That was between 5.23 and 5.24, compare src/verify.c from <https://www.usenix.org.uk/mirrors/stunnel/archive/5.x/stunnel-5.23.tar.gz> and <https://www.usenix.org.uk/mirrors/stunnel/archive/5.x/stunnel-5.24.tar.gz> .

I hit this issue in the summer of 2018, after fixing the two crashes (issue [#858](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/858) and issue [#861](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/861)) when dealing with TLS CRLs using CentOS 7's ProFTPD 1.3.5e package against OpenSSL 1.0.2\*.

I quickly reported the issues privately, but ProFTPD's TLS CRL handling remains broken on all branches more than a year later... I'm aware that TLS CRLs are highly unpopular, and that only system administrators are supposed to define them, but clearly, low-profile responsible disclosure didn't work here :)

Public reports, and CVE ID assignments (for which I'll use this issue as reference), piling onto the recent higher risk issue [#846](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/846) ([CVE-2019-18217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5446-jrwr-x7c6 "CVE-2019-18217")) and older vulnerabilities should help the downstream propagation of all fixes, at least if any downstream provides security support for ProFTPD.

# CVE-2019-19270

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19269.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19271.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19270 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19270)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in tls\_verify\_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-bfacf1e958
2019-12-08 01:16:01.293717
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update addresses a number of bugs affecting processing of CRLs in mod\_tls,
including possible null pointer dereferences and missing some checks. Thanks to
Lionel Debroux for reporting them.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1777975#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2019-11-28 20:49:30 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. A dereference of a NULL pointer may occur. This pointer is returned by the OpenSSL sk_X509_REVOKED_value() function when encountering an empty CRL installed by a system administrator. The dereference occurs when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server in a TLS client/server mutual-authentication setup.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1777975#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2019-11-28 20:49:46 UTC  ``` Created proftpd tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: epel-6 [[bug 1777977](show_bug.cgi?id=1777977 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-19269 proftpd: NULL pointer dereference when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server [epel-6]")] Affects: epel-7 [[bug 1777978](show_bug.cgi?id=1777978 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-19269 proftpd: NULL pointer dereference when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server [epel-7]")] Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1777976](show_bug.cgi?id=1777976 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-19269 proftpd: NULL pointer dereference when validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1777975#c2)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-11-29 01:04:49 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-65a983b8b6
2019-12-08 01:02:51.298843
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 2.fc30
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update addresses a number of bugs affecting processing of CRLs in mod\_tls,
including possible null pointer dereferences and missing some checks. Thanks to
Lionel Debroux for reporting them.
