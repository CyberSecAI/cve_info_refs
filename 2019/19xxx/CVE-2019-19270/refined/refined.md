{
  "CVE-2019-19270": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in tls_verify_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.",
    "Root cause": "The code in `tls_verify_crl` function incorrectly performs a CRL lookup by subject instead of issuer, which prevents some valid CRLs from being used.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Handling",
       "Incorrect field lookup"
    ],
    "Impact": "Clients with revoked certificates can bypass the revocation check and connect to the server, potentially leading to unauthorized access.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a revoked certificate and the ability to connect to the ProFTPD server."
