Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-19119:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from the fact that local users have read access to the registry path used by PRTG, specifically the path where the PRTG passhash of the PRTG System Administrator user account is stored.
* The mechanism used for password hash calculation is not cryptographically secure and is vulnerable to collisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Insecure Storage of Passhashes:** The PRTG passhash, which is used for authentication, is stored in a way that is accessible to local users.
* **Cryptographically Weak Hashing:** The passhash is not created using a strong one-way cryptographic algorithm, making it vulnerable to brute-force and collision attacks.
* **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local user with low privileges can obtain the admin passhash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can use the stolen passhash to access the PRTG Network Monitor software with the PRTG System Administrator user's privileges.
* **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can extract detailed information on network hosts and their configuration. This provides a wide range of opportunities for an attack, for instance, gaining access to an IT or ICS infrastructure if the software is used on boundary hosts.
* **Data Integrity:** Although not explicitly stated, with admin privileges, attackers could modify data within the PRTG system as well.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by a user with local access to the system where the PRTG software is installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to have a local user account on the system with read access to the registry path.
* No specific network access is needed for this attack beyond having a valid local user.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided blog content mentions that the vulnerability was discovered by Aleksandr Melkikh from Positive Technologies.
* The content also notes that Positive Technologies has identified other high-risk vulnerabilities in PRTG software before, specifically related to its web interface ([CVE-2018-19203](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19203), [CVE-2018-19204](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19204), [CVE-2018-19410](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19410), [CVE-2018-19411](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-19411)).
* The official Paessler blog post also mentions this vulnerability and states they released version 19.4.54 to address the issue. They also mention that they no longer display the PRTG version in HTTP headers, and the version is only shown in the page footer for authenticated users.
*  The provided content from *www.paessler.com* does not mention the specific vulnerability of CVE-2019-19119, but it does highlight other security fixes in subsequent release notes.

In summary, CVE-2019-19119 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability that allows a local attacker to potentially obtain administrative access to the PRTG software by exploiting a weak passhash storage and generation mechanism.
