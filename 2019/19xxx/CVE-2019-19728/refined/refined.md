Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2019-19728:

*   **Relates to:** Slurm (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management)
*   **Vulnerability:** A race condition exists in the `srun` client command, specifically when using the `--uid` option. This race condition can lead to `srun` not dropping into the correct user account and instead launching tasks as root, despite printing a warning message.
*   **Attack vector:** Exploitation requires the root user to execute `srun` with the `--uid` option. The vulnerability is triggered by a race condition during successive lookup calls within the `srun` client.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, where tasks are unintentionally executed with root privileges instead of the intended user.
*   **Affected versions:** The SchedMD announcement indicates this affects Slurm. The SUSE bug tracker indicates it affects slurm versions before the fixes.
*   **Fix:** The Suse bug tracker indicates the issue was resolved. Debian DSA-4841-1 addresses this vulnerability in the stable distribution (buster) by upgrading to version 18.08.5.2-1+deb10u2.
*   **Mitigation:** SchedMD recommends against using the `srun --uid` option and may remove it in a future release.
