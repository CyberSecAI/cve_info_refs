{
  "CVE-2019-19882": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors in the shadow package: the introduction of setuid binaries for account management tools when compiled with PAM support, a fix to install hooks that had previously been failing silently due to directory mismatches, and a default PAM configuration that was too permissive, allowing any user to run these binaries without authentication.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The main vulnerability lies in the installation of several account management tools (chgpasswd, chpasswd, groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, newusers, useradd, userdel, usermod) as setuid-root without proper PAM configuration. Specifically, the PAM configuration included `pam_permit` which effectively bypasses authentication and allows any user to create, modify, or delete other users or groups.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "The impact of this vulnerability is that any local user could exploit the setuid-root binaries to escalate their privileges to root, allowing them to fully control the system through unauthorized user/group management. This includes creating new admin accounts, modifying existing users, deleting users, and more.",
      "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is local, meaning that the attacker must have access to a shell on the vulnerable system.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be a local user on the affected system. No prior elevated privileges are required to exploit this flaw."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A fix in the shadow package's build system caused setuid bits to be correctly applied to account management tools, which was not happening before due to install hook errors. The default configuration when building with PAM enabled setuid bits on these tools and included a permissive PAM configuration that did not require authentication.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The vulnerability lies in the setuid bit being enabled by default on several account management tools (chgpasswd, chpasswd, groupadd, groupdel, groupmod, newusers, useradd, userdel, usermod) when built with PAM. Additionally, the default PAM configuration included 'pam_permit', which allowed any user to use these tools without authentication.",
       "Impact of exploitation":"An unprivileged local user could exploit these setuid-root tools with a permissive PAM configuration to perform actions that require root privileges, such as adding, modifying, or deleting users and groups. This leads to privilege escalation.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is locally exploitable.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position":"The attacker must be a local user on the vulnerable system."
