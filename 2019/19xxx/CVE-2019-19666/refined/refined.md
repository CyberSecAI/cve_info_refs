Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-19666

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the "Event Notices Settings" of the Rumpus FTP Web File Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can create or update event notices for Email, Batch Scripts, and Data File on behalf of a victim user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A crafted request sent to `RAPR/EventNoticesSet.html`. The attacker can trick a logged-in user into triggering this request, usually by embedding it in a malicious website or email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint (`RAPR/EventNoticesSet.html`) and the required parameters.
- The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting a malicious page or clicking a malicious link, thus making the victim's browser send the crafted request to the vulnerable server.
- No special privileges are needed on the FTP server itself; the attacker exploits the user's active session.
