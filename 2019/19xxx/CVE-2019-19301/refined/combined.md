SSA-102233: SegmentSmack in VxWorks-based Industrial Devices

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2020-04-14
2023-04-11
V2.1

SUMMARY

The products listed below contain a vulnerability that could allow remote attackers to affect the availability
of the devices under certain conditions. The underlying TCP stack can be forced to make very computation
expensive calls for every incoming packet which can lead to a Denial-of-Service.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• In all other cases please follow the General Security Recommendations
• For SIMATIC RF180C and RF182C: migrate to a successor product within the SIMATIC RF18xC/CI

family, V1.3 or later version. For details refer to the phase-out announcement.

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIMATIC CP 343-1 and CP 443-1 are communication processors (CP) designed to enable Ethernet
communication for SIMATIC S7-300/S7-400 CPUs.

SIMATIC RF180C is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identiﬁcation
systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet. SIMATIC RF180C is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices
(RF185C, RF186C, RF188C).

SIMATIC RF182C is an RFID communication module for direct connection of SIMATIC identiﬁcation
systems to Ethernet/IP. SIMATIC RF182C is superseded by the SIMATIC RF18xC devices (RF185C,
RF186C, RF188C).

SIMATIC RF185C, RF186C/CI, and RF188C/CI are communication modules for direct connection of
SIMATIC identiﬁcation systems to PROFINET IO/Ethernet and OPC UA.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19301

The VxWorks-based Proﬁnet TCP Stack can be forced to make very expensive calls for every incoming
packet which can lead to a denial of service.
