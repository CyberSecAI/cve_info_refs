- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The VxWorks-based Profinet TCP stack can be forced to make very computation-expensive calls for every incoming packet.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Uncontrolled resource consumption (CWE-400). The TCP stack does not properly handle incoming packets, leading to excessive resource usage.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability can cause the affected devices to become unavailable due to resource exhaustion.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted network packets to the vulnerable devices.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the vulnerable devices. No special privileges or user interaction is needed.
