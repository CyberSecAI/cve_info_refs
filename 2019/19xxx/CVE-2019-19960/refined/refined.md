{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is related to a side-channel cache attack on the `wc_ecc_mulmod_ex` function, which is used in ECDSA signing operations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability due to cache timing differences when processing different key bits during scalar multiplication in ECC operations."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with the ability to monitor the cache could potentially deduce information about the private key by observing the timing of the `wc_ecc_mulmod_ex` function.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Side-channel cache timing attacks on the `wc_ecc_mulmod_ex` function."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to monitor the cache of the target system where ECDSA signing operations are performed. This may require physical access or other means of accessing the system's cache."
  },
  "fixes": [
   "The fix involves modifying the `wc_ecc_mulmod_ex` function to include cache-resistant techniques when not using the `WC_NO_CACHE_RESISTANT` option. This includes constant-time memory access patterns to prevent cache timing differences that could leak information about key bits."
