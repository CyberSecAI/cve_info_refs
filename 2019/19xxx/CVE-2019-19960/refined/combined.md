# wolfSSL Release 4.3.0 (12/20/2019)

If you have questions about this release, then feel free to contact us on our info@ address.

Release 4.3.0 of wolfSSL embedded TLS has bug fixes and new features including:

##### New Feature Additions

* Add --enable-libwebsockets option for support of libwebsockets build
* Updated support for NGINX 1.15.0 and added support for 1.16.1
* Add wc\_scrypt\_ex API which can take in iterations rather than cost
* Updates to RSA-PSS salt lengths. Macro WOLFSSL\_PSS\_SALT\_LEN\_DISCOVER allows for discovering the salt length. Passing RSA\_PSS\_SALT\_LEN\_DISCOVER value into wc\_RsaPSS\_Verify\_ex attempts to discover salt length and can use larger salt lengths
* Additional OpenSSL compatibility API wolfSSL\_CertManagerGetCerts and wolfSSL\_X509\_STORE\_GetCerts for retrieving certificates
* Add support for 4096-bit RSA/DH operations to SP (single precision) build
* Update support for Google WebRTC to branch m79
* Adds new FREESCALE\_MQX\_5\_0 macro for MQX 5.0 support

* Fix for vasprintf with Solaris and AIX builds
* Fix for missing variable declaration with --enable-scep --with-libz build
* Fix for certificate date check with async build
* Sanity check on “out” length with Base64\_Decode added
* Decode X.509 name - check input length for jurisdiction
* Additional sanity check on variable out index with DecodePolicyOID
* Fix for PKCS#12 PBKDF buffer size for buffer overflow
* TLS supported curve extension check curve name is in range before checking for disabled
* Sanity check for non TLS 1.3 cipher suite with TLS 1.3 connection
* Poly1305 AVX2 assembly optimization fix for carry with large input values
* Fixes for coverity report including null termination of test case strings and initialization of PKCS7 variables
* Fix for API visibility of wc\_ed25519\_check\_key which resolves a wolfcrypt-py install issue
* Sanity check on max ALPN length accepted
* Additional sanity check when parsing CRL’s for copying the structure, fix for bounds checking
* Additional checks on error string length for debug mode and check for null termination
* ProcessPeerCerts allocating memory for exts with OPENSSL\_EXTRA properly
* Clear the top bit when generating a serial number
* Sanity check that ASN date characters are valid ASCII characters
* Fix to add deterministic ECDSA and fix corner cases for add point.
* When getting the DH public key, initialize the P, G, and Pub pointers to NULL, then set that we own the DH parameters flag. This allows FreeSSL to correctly clean up the DH key.

##### This release of wolfSSL includes a fix for 6 security vulnerabilities.

A fix for having an additional sanity check when parsing certificate domain names was added. This fix checks that the domain name location index is not past the maximum value before setting it. The reported issue affects users that are parsing certificates and have --enable-opensslextra (macro OPENSSL\_EXTRA), or build options that turn this on such as --enable-all, when building wolfSSL. The CVE associated with the fix is [CVE-2019-18840](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-42mp-7xj4-8whx "CVE-2019-18840").

Fix to set a limit on the maximum size of DTLS handshake messages. By default the RFC allows for handshake message sizes of up to 2^24-1 bytes long but in typical field use cases the handshake messages are not this large. Setting a maximum size limit on the handshake message helps avoid a potential DoS attack due to memory being malloc’d. The new default max size is set to handle a certificate chain length of approximately 9, 2048 bit RSA certificates. This only effects builds that have DTLS turned on and have applications that are using DTLS.

Fix for a potential hang when ECC caching is enabled (off by default) and --enable-fastmath is used. ECC caching is off by default and is turned on in builds that are using --enable-all or --enable-fpecc. This issue does not affect builds that are using the macro WOLFSSL\_VALIDATE\_ECC\_IMPORT which turns on validating all ECC keys that are imported. To fix this potential hang case a sanity check on the input values to the internal invmod function was added.

To fix a potential fault injection attack on a wrapper function for wolfCrypt RSA signature generations an additional sanity check verifying the signature after it’s creation was added. This check is already done automatically in current versions of wolfSSL with TLS connections (internal function call of VerifyRsaSign during TLS state machine). The report only affects users making calls to the wolfCrypt function wc\_SignatureGenerateHash and does not affect current TLS use cases. Thanks to Daniel Moghimi (@danielmgmi) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.

Blinding was added for DSA signing operations. The DSA signing uses the BEEA algorithm during modular inversion of the nonce which can potentially leak the nonce through side channels such as cache and power fluctuations. The fix of adding in blinding makes the DSA signing operation more resistant to side channel attacks. Users who have turned on DSA (disabled by default) and are performing signing operations should update. Note that DSA is not used in any TLS connections. Thanks to Daniel Moghimi (@danielmgmi) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.

Fix to add additional side channel cache attack resistance to the internal ECC function wc\_ecc\_mulmod\_ex. This function by default is used with ECDSA signing operations. Users should update if performing ECDSA singing operations (server side ECC TLS connections, mutual authentication on client side) or calling wolfCrypt ECC sign functions and have the potential for outside users to perform sophisticated monitoring of the cache.Thanks to Daniel Moghimi (@danielmgmi) from Worcester Polytechnic Institute for the report.
