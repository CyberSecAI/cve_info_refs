The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19341.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- During a Tower backup, intermediate files within `/var/backup/tower` are created with world-readable permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The world-readable permissions on backup files including the `SECRET_KEY` and database backup.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Any user with access to the Tower server could retrieve every credential stored in Tower by accessing these backup files. This is a high severity issue, as it provides access to highly sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the Tower server's file system.
- They need knowledge of when a backup runs so they can access the backup files during the backup process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires local access to the Tower server.
- Requires knowledge of when backups occur.

**Affected versions:**
- Ansible Tower 3.6.1 and 3.5.3 are specifically mentioned as affected.
- Fixed in Ansible Tower 3.6.2

**Additional notes:**
- Red Hat CloudForms 4.7 (5.10) is not affected, as it does not perform Ansible Tower backups.
- The vulnerability was addressed via errata RHSA-2019:4242 for Ansible Tower 3.5 and RHSA-2019:4243 for Ansible Tower 3.6.
