# GitLab Security Release: 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7

Learn more about GitLab Security Release: 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE)

Today we are releasing versions 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately. If you are unable to upgrade, consider [disabling Elasticsearch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#disabling-elasticsearch).

**Update** Two fixes for GitLab Omnibus inadvertently did not make it into this release, so we are releasing new minor versions in order to include those changes in all versions of GitLab. We **strongly recommend** that all installations be updated to the new versions (12.5.2, 12.4.5, 12.3.8) once they are available.

The vulnerability details will be made public on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=security&scope=all&state=opened) in approximately 30 days.

Please read on for more information regarding this release.
