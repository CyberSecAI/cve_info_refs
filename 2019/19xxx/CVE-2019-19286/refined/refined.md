- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection (CWE-89)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of data, or disruption of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The web interface is the attack vector. An attacker needs to be able to modify the content of specific web pages to inject malicious SQL commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) to modify the content of particular web pages to inject the SQL commands.
