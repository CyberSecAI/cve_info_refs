{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer over-read in the `ReadJpegSections` and `process_SOFn` functions within `jpgfile.c`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service. The application crashes due to memory access violation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Opening a specially crafted JPEG file"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious JPEG file.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs when processing specific JPEG sections, where the code reads beyond allocated memory, leading to the crash. The provided proof-of-concept files (`jhead_poc1`, `jhead_poc2`, `jhead_poc3`) demonstrate the issue."
