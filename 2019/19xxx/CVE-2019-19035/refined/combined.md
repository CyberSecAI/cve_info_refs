| [Description](#c0)  caspar-gentoo-bugs    2004-11-05 11:39:48 UTC  ``` installed packages x11-base/xorg-x11: 6.7.0 kde-base/kdelibs: 3.3.1 kde-base/kdebase: 3.3.1  I didn't upgrade my xorg-x11 yet.  So I use 6.7.0-r2 instead of 6.8.0-r1, which shows up on `emerge -Dup world` since a couple of days.  On Nov 04 I upgraded kdelibs and kdebase from 3.3.0 to 3.3.1 and directly afterwards got this from `emerge -Dup world`:  [ebuild     U ] x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.0-r1 [6.7.0-r2] [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.0 [3.3.1] [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.0 [3.3.1]  How could portage tell me to update packages which it calls me to downgrade directly afterwards?  I thought it to be a short-time thing resolved by the next sync. So I waited for this next sync, which was today.  For today I got the same result and I decided to downgrade these two packages, kdelibs and kdebase.  I first did an `emerge -Dup kdelibs kdebase` to show what would happen and I got this:  [ebuild     U ] x11-base/xorg-x11-6.8.0-r1 [6.7.0-r2]  Why didn't portage tell me about any dependency the day before?   And I thought it to be a problem with the -Du options and tried `emerge -p kdelibs kdebase` and got this:  [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.1 [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.1  How should this resolve the issue?  I am not delighted by this situation: - If kdelibs and kdebase really depend on the new version of xorg-x11 there should have been anything telling me about this.  But this didn't happen.  And I don't see why it should, 3.3.1 works fine with 6.7.0. - I can't understand how I was able to upgrade two packages without any complaint and directly afterwards to get the information to downgrade again, because of some dependency problem not being resolved before. - If I try to downgrade these packages then I don't want to upgrade another package or re-emerge these packages again, both results not being able to resolve what `emerge -Dup world` told about the status of these packages.  My main concern about all this is not anything with these three packages but with portage not resolving this issue properly and leaving one in a situation I don't see stable (in it's messages, not it's installation).   bye  caspar   Reproducible: Didn't try Steps to Reproduce: 1. get a system with xorg-x11 6.7.0.r2 and kdelibs/kdebase 3.3.0 2. emerge -Dup world 3. emerge -v kdelibs kdebase 4. emerge -Dup world   Actual Results:   Step 2 tells one to upgrade the packages. Step 4 tells one to downgrade these very same packages.   Expected Results:   Option 1: not telling to downgrade these packages kdelibs and kdebase. Option 2: telling about dependency upon xorg-x11 version 6.8.0. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  caspar-gentoo-bugs    2004-11-05 12:03:09 UTC  ``` It's even more weird:  I installed xorg-x11-6.8.0-r1 now and get this:  emerge -Dup world [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.0 [3.3.1] [ebuild     UD] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.0 [3.3.1]  emerge -p kdelibs kdebase [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdelibs-3.3.1 [ebuild   R   ] kde-base/kdebase-3.3.1  emerge -Dup kdelibs kdebase <empty>  It's all on the same machine, executed directly after each other.  I will not downgrade kdelibs nor kdebase.  It only annoys me for I don't like my package management system not properly resolving things.  bye  caspar ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Caleb Tennis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-11-05 14:36:21 UTC  ``` emerge sync  then tell me if you still have the problem ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  caspar-gentoo-bugs    2004-11-05 16:41:39 UTC  ``` Yes, it's gone.  But is there an explanation for the behaviour of portage on this issue? ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Caleb Tennis (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2004-12-01 10:36:58 UTC  ``` Yeah, was a ebuild version typo.  Fixed now. ``` |  |
