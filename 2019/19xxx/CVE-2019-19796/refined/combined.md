## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Dec 13, 2019](https://github.com/marcIhm/yabasic/issues/37#issue-537739601)

Hi,

While fuzzing yabasic 2.86.2 with Honggfuzz, I found a heap-based buffer overflow in the myformat() function, in function.c.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it): [test02.yab.gz](https://github.com/marcIhm/yabasic/files/3962433/test02.yab.gz)

Issue can be reproduced by running:

```
yabasic test02.yab

```

```
