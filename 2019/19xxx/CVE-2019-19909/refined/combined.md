# Use json\_encode/json\_decode instead of serialize/unserialize in report generator #5302

## Description

![@asmecher](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/200411?v=4&size=48)[asmecher](https://github.com/asmecher)opened [on Nov 26, 2019](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/5302#issue-528960368)

JSON is limited to simple constructs like arrays, strings, and numbers. `serialize`/`unserialize` can be used to describe more complex objects, which may not be trustworthy.

Use `json_encode`/`json_decode` instead of `serialize`/`unserialize` in the report generator. Review elsewhere for similar usage.

This is a potential security issue -- PHP `unserialize` can be used for code injections. Abuse of this issue requires Journal Manager access; social engineering is possible, if a logged-in Journal Manager can be tricked into visiting a specially-crafted (albeit long) URL.

This is corrected in OJS/OMP 3.1.2-2 or newer. See [#5302 (comment)](https://github.com/pkp/pkp-lib/issues/5302#issuecomment-558828633) for patching instructions for older versions.

Affects OJS 3.x and OMP installations 3.1.2-1 and older.

Thanks to Franek Kalinowski, Isec.pl Research Team for discovering and reporting the issue! This has been assigned [CVE ID CVE-2019-19909](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19909).

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff 3_1_2-1...3_1_2-2`
