CVE-2019-19909
```

- **Root Cause:** The application uses `serialize`/`unserialize` in the report generator, while `json_encode`/`json_decode` should be used instead. `serialize`/`unserialize` can describe more complex objects, which may not be trustworthy.
- **Vulnerability:** PHP `unserialize` can be used for code injections.
- **Impact:** Abuse of this issue requires Journal Manager access; social engineering is possible if a logged-in Journal Manager can be tricked into visiting a specially-crafted URL, potentially leading to code injection.
- **Affected versions:** OJS 3.x and OMP installations 3.1.2-1 and older.
- **Mitigation:** This is corrected in OJS/OMP 3.1.2-2 or newer.
