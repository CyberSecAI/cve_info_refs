- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of block descriptions when displayed, specifically those created by administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the necessary permissions could inject malicious scripts into block descriptions. When an administrator configures a layout containing this block, the injected script would be executed.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - An attacker crafts a malicious block description containing JavaScript.
    - An administrator configures a layout and includes the crafted block, triggering the XSS.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have permission to create custom blocks, which is typically an administrative task.
