Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2019-19254:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an insufficient access control check in the Cycle Analytics feature. Specifically, the commit count was being exposed to guest users, even in private projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the unauthorized disclosure of the number of commits within a project to users who should not have access to this information (guests).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A guest user, who is intended to have limited visibility within a private project, could view the number of commits made in the last 90 days via the Cycle Analytics page.
*   In public projects where the repository is configured to be visible only to project members, any logged-in user could still view the number of commits.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves a guest user navigating to the Cycle Analytics page of a private project. Alternatively, any logged-in user could do the same on a public project regardless of the repository visibility settings.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a guest member of a private project or a logged-in user accessing a public project. No special privileges or prior knowledge are required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported via HackerOne by `ashish_r_padelkar`.
*   The issue affects GitLab CE/EE versions 9.6 and later.
*   The fix was implemented in GitLab versions 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7.
