SSA-844761: Multiple Vulnerabilities in SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

2020-03-10

V1.3

SUMMARY

The Video Server application in SiNVR/SiVMS solutions contains five vulnerabilities involving information
disclosure (CVE-2019-19291, CVE-2019-19299), path traversal (CVE-2019-19296, CVE-2019-19297),
and denial-of-service (CVE-2019-19298).

PKE has released updates of the application that fixes the reported vulnerabilities, except for CVE-2019-
19299. This update is not available under the former Siemens OEM brand name SiNVR. For details
contact PKE (https://pke.at/).

and Mitigations

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply ACL/firewall configuration on the Video Servers to ensure that only legitimate systems are
able to access the configured server ports. Harden all systems accordingly to prevent unauthorized
access Consider to apply encryption and authentication on the network (e.g., via TLS on application
level or via IPSec on host level)

• CVE-2019-19291, CVE-2019-19296: Disable the two FTP services of the Video Server
• CVE-2019-19298: The update to V5.0.2 also provides an additional authentication feature that
allows to protect the access to the streaming service via individual account names and passwords
for every stream recorder. It is recommended to configure this feature accordingly. For details see
the release notes of V5.0.2

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Control Center Server (CCS) is the optional central server component of PKE management solutions
(e.g., SiNVR/SiVMS). The CCS combines all centralized tasks within a server, such as database access
or user management.

SiNVR is the Siemens OEM version of SiVMS, a video management solution acquired by PKE Deutsch-
land GmbH and formerly distributed by Schille Informationssysteme GmbH. SiNVR/SiVMS is not to be
confused with the product Siveillance VMS. Note that SiNVR is no longer distributed or supported by
Siemens beyond version 3.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classification has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.first.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is specific to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually defined by the customer to accomplish final scoring.

An additional classification has been performed using the CWE classification, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19291

The FTP services of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server and the Control Center Server (CCS) maintain
log files that store login credentials in cleartext. In configurations where the FTP service is enabled,
authenticated remote attackers could extract login credentials of other users of the service.

CWE-313: Cleartext Storage in a File or on Disk

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19296

The two FTP services (default ports 21/tcp and 5411/tcp) of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server contain a
path traversal vulnerability that could allow an authenticated remote attacker to access and download
arbitrary files from the server, if the FTP services are enabled.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19297

The streaming service (default port 5410/tcp) of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server contains a path
traversal vulnerability, that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to access and download
arbitrary files from the server.

(’Path Traversal’)

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19298

The streaming service (default port 5410/tcp) of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server contains a input
validation vulnerability, that could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a Denial-of-
Service condition by sending malformed HTTP requests.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19299

The streaming service (default port 5410/tcp) of the SiVMS/SiNVR Video Server applies weak
cryptography when exposing device (camera) passwords. This could allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to read and decrypt the passwords and conduct further attacks.
