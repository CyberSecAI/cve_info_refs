- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The two FTP services (default ports 21/tcp and 5411/tcp) of the SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server do not properly validate pathnames.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Traversal (CWE-22) vulnerability exists in the FTP services of the SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to access and download arbitrary files from the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker interacts with the vulnerable FTP services using their default ports.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system, and must be able to access the FTP ports.
