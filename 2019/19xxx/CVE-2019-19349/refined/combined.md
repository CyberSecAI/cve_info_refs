| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1793281#c0)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 04:28:09 UTC  ``` It has been found that multiple containers modify the permissions of /etc/passwd to make them modifiable by users other than root. An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this to modify /etc/passwd to add a user and escalate their privileges. This CVE is specific to the openshift/presto-container.  Original bug: [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1791534](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534 "CLOSED ERRATA - OpenShift: containers modify /etc/passwd group writable")   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1793281#c1)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 04:28:12 UTC  ``` Statement:  By default this vulnerability is not exploitable in un-privilieged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform. This is because the system call SETUID and SETGID is blocked by the default seccomp policy.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1793281#c4)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-22 03:18:29 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Joseph LaMagna-Reiter (SPR Inc.)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1793281#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2020-05-04 10:52:02 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.4  Via RHSA-2020:1942 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020:1942](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2020%3A1942)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1793281#c8)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-05-04 16:31:50 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-19352>   ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534#c0)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-16 04:58:59 UTC  ``` A possible privilege escalation has been found in containers which modify the permissions of their local /etc/passwd.  Within a container by default a user is assigned to the root group:     sh-4.2$ id     uid=1001(default) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)  When this is combined with a loosening of permissions on /etc/passwd, it is possible for any user in the container to modify the passwd file and assume root.   For example: <https://github.com/operator-framework/presto/blob/master/Dockerfile.rhel#L75>     chmod -R 774 /etc/passwd $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts &&   To then add a new root user (in a contrived example):     oc rsh presto     echo test::0:0:/root:/bin/bash >> /etc/passwd     su test   Additionally, as a result of OpenShift not implementing user namespaces as of yet, if root is achieved in the container - root is technically achieved on the host.  It is our understanding that this chmod of /etc/passwd has have become necessary to support arbitrary user ids as per this document: <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.2/openshift_images/create-images.html#images-create-guide-openshift_create-images>  The document does state, "that there are no security concerns with this arrangement", however from the above example we can see that this is not true.   It should also be noted however, that containers in OpenShift do run under a restricted SCC context by default, with CAP_SETUID and CAP_SETGID both dropped. This increases the difficulty significantly to achieve access to the host directly. Even with protections like this (including SELinux), this technique provides a relatively easy first step in achieving a container escape and is still considered an escalation in privileges.   The following containers so far have been identified to modify /etc/passwd:  - hadoop  - hive  - jenkins-slave-base-rhel7  - openshift-enterprise-apb-base  - openshift-enterprise-apb  - openshift-enterprise-mediawiki  - openshift-enterprise-tests  - openshift-jenkins-2  - ose-metering-ansible-operator  - presto  - sso73-openshift   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534#c2)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-20 04:32:39 UTC  ``` Overall the following 17 OpenShift containers contain the incorrect /etc/passwd permissions (some are built from the same repo):  * hadoop-container * hive-container * jenkins-slave-base-rhel7-container * openshift-enterprise-ansible-operator-container * openshift-enterprise-ansible-service-broker-operator-container * openshift-enterprise-apb-base-container * openshift-enterprise-apb-tools-container * openshift-enterprise-mariadb-apb * openshift-enterprise-mediawiki-apb * openshift-enterprise-mediawiki-container * openshift-enterprise-mysql-apb * openshift-enterprise-postgresql-apb * openshift-enterprise-template-service-broker-operator-container * openshift-enterprise-tests-container * ose-metering-ansible-operator-container * presto-container  * openshift-istio-kiali-rhel7-operator-container   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1791534#c7)  Mark Cooper    2020-01-21 06:45:23 UTC  ``` Unembargoed.
