- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The WP Maintenance WordPress plugin lacked nonce protection and input/output sanitization, leading to a combination of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **CSRF:** Settings across multiple tabs in the plugin could be modified without proper nonce verification, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
    - **Stored XSS:** The "Enable Newsletter" feature allowed injection of malicious code in the newsletter title, which was then displayed on the maintenance page without output sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - An attacker could enable maintenance mode on a site, causing a loss of availability.
    - By injecting malicious code via XSS, the attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in visitors' browsers when the site was in maintenance mode, potentially redirecting them to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attacker would need to craft a malicious HTML form targeting the vulnerable plugin's settings update endpoints.
    - This form would then need to be triggered by an authenticated administrator, for example by tricking them into clicking a link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability besides the ability to entice an authenticated administrator to click on the crafted request.
    - The attacker must entice a logged-in admin to click a link or similar.
