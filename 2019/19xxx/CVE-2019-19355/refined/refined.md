Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19355:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple containers within the `openshift/ocp-release-operator-sdk` improperly modifying the permissions of the `/etc/passwd` file. Specifically, the permissions are changed to allow modification by users other than root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core vulnerability is that the `/etc/passwd` file, which should only be modifiable by the root user, is made writable by other users due to a configuration issue in the containers. This violates the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who gains access to the affected container can modify the `/etc/passwd` file. By adding a new user with root privileges, or modifying the existing users, the attacker can achieve privilege escalation to gain root access on the container. This could potentially allow further exploitation and compromise of the host system depending on the container's configuration and any shared resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Container:** The primary attack vector is through a compromised container. An attacker needs to gain some level of access to a container that has the vulnerable configuration.
*   **File Modification:** Once inside the container, the attacker leverages the insecure permissions to modify the `/etc/passwd` file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Container Access:** The attacker must have some form of access to a running container instance with the vulnerable configuration. This could be achieved through other vulnerabilities, compromised applications, or misconfigured container deployments.
*   **Basic Linux Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of Linux file permissions and the structure of the `/etc/passwd` file to successfully carry out the exploit.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text indicates that this vulnerability is not exploitable by default in unprivileged containers on OpenShift due to the default `seccomp` policy blocking `SETUID` and `SETGID` system calls. This policy would need to be modified to enable this exploit.
* The specific affected container is the `openshift/ansible-operator-container` and is part of the `openshift/ocp-release-operator-sdk`.
* The issue has been addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 via errata RHSA-2020:0683, RHSA-2020:1280, and RHSA-2020:1545, respectively.
