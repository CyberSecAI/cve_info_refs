{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in the calculation of bytes per row when processing a BMP image, specifically within the `input-bmp.c` file. The multiplication of `biWidth` (image width) and `biBitCnt` (bits per pixel) can result in a value that exceeds the maximum representable value for the data type used, leading to a smaller-than-expected value being used for memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-190"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a malformed bitmap image that triggers the integer overflow. This results in a too small memory allocation. Subsequent operations can cause a crash due to heap overflow or dereferencing NULL pointer.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by loading a specially crafted BMP image with specific `biWidth` and `biBitCnt` values. The crafted image can be provided as input to the `autotrace` utility.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted BMP image as input to the `autotrace` utility. This could be a local file or through a service that processes user-provided files."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "fix_commit": "The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check for overflow in the calculation of row bytes, as shown in commit `64c5833e55d7672d6136a3fbfeae24bd012d36a5`.",
    "related_cves": "The provided content also mentions CVE-2019-19005, which is a related double-free vulnerability in `main.c`. This content indicates that CVE-2019-19004 is related to integer overflows.",
    "fedora_update": "The vulnerability was addressed in Fedora 34 with an update to autotrace (version 0.31.1-60.fc34) which was released on 2021-05-10. This update is linked to `FEDORA-2021-cb871c9e6c`.",
    "redhat_errata": "Red Hat also addressed this vulnerability in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via RHSA-2021:4519.",
        "malloc_issue": "The vulnerability can cause the `malloc` function to return NULL pointer due to the overflowed size calculation and a later assert will be triggered. This can cause a DoS for applications using the `autotrace` library."
