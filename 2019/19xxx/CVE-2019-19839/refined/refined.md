Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-19839:

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-19839 is one of a series of vulnerabilities discovered in Ruckus access points. This particular CVE relates to a command injection vulnerability exploitable through a specific function call within the web interface. This vulnerability is part of a larger attack chain that includes arbitrary file write and authentication bypass.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the `uploadFile` attribute is directly inserted into a system command in the `cmdImportCatagory()` function without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The `cmdImportCatagory()` function in `emfd` does not sanitize the `uploadFile` parameter before using it in a `system()` call, leading to command injection.
*   **Authentication bypass:**  An arbitrary file write vulnerability in the `zap` command can be combined with the command injection vulnerability in `cmdImportCatagory()` function to achieve pre-authentication remote code execution. The file write is used to create a new jsp page that does not perform authentication checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the Ruckus access point with root privileges by injecting malicious commands.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to take full control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited via specially crafted HTTP requests to the web interface.
*   **Chained exploit:** The command injection vulnerability is exploited by creating a custom jsp page with arbitrary file write and bypassing authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the vulnerable Ruckus access point.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `cmdImportCatagory()` function endpoint.
*   **Ability to craft a command injection payload:** Knowledge of the system is needed to create a valid command injection payload.

**Additional details from the content:**
*   This vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities found by Aleph Security.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by using a crafted XML payload within a POST request.
*   The command injection is possible through the `uploadFile` attribute when calling the `import-avpport` command
*   The specific function `cmdImportCatagory()` is called by `AjaxCmdStat()` which is called from the jsp page `/admin/_cmdstat.jsp`.
*   The authentication check on this jsp page can be bypassed by writing an arbitrary page using another vulnerability in the `zap` binary.
*   The fix involves proper input sanitization.
*   Ruckus Unleashed AP 200.7.10.202.92 and later versions include fixes for this vulnerability.
