Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Humax HGB10R-2 router transmits admin credentials using HTTP Basic Authentication, which only employs Base64 encoding. This encoding is easily reversible, exposing the credentials to anyone who can intercept the traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Transmission of Credentials:** The router sends credentials over HTTP, which is not encrypted, and uses only Base64 encoding which is not a strong form of security.
- **Lack of HTTPS:** The absence of HTTPS encryption allows attackers to intercept credentials transmitted over the network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Router Control:** An attacker who obtains the admin credentials can gain complete control over the router, allowing them to:
    - Change configurations
    - Access network data
    - Potentially pivot to other devices on the network

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Sniffing:** An attacker on the same local network as the router, or one who can intercept the network traffic, can capture the HTTP requests using tools like Wireshark to obtain the encoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the targeted router or be able to intercept network traffic between the router and the user.
- **Packet Capture Tools:** The attacker requires tools capable of capturing network traffic, such as Wireshark.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content also mentions another vulnerability in the backup file of the router, which exposes both admin and WiFi credentials. This vulnerability is related to CVE-2017-7317 and not CVE-2019-19889,
- The content provides a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) video demonstrating the attack using Wireshark to capture the credentials.
