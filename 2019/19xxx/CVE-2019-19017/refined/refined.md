Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-19017:

**CVE-2019-19017: Hard-coded root password**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: During the installation process, a `sed` script (`/tmp/wtinstall.sed`) sets a hard-coded hash as the root password.
    *   The script snippet from the provided document shows the following being added to the `/etc/passwd` file, specifically the second line:
    ```
    root:$1$QmzXNacZ$7IEefuHZZNMg72oko7u9q0:0:0::0:0:Charlie &:/root:/bin/csh
    ```
    This second line shows the hardcoded password hash for the root user.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A static, easily discoverable password hash is set for the root user during installation.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker gaining local access to the system can easily obtain root access using the hardcoded credentials, bypassing standard authentication mechanisms.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   Physical access to the machine or virtual console access.
    *   Compromise of another user account through other means which permits local login.
    *   Exploitation of a vulnerability that grants remote access to a shell.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Must be able to log in locally.
    *   If the attacker has a remote shell, they need to be able to log in locally.
