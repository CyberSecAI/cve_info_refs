Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the DLL hijacking vulnerability in AdwCleaner:

**Root Cause:**

*   The AdwCleaner application, prior to version 8.0.1, did not enforce the loading paths for DLL files. This means that when the application tried to load a DLL, it would first look in the current directory from where it was executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The primary vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue. The application loads DLLs without specifying the full path, making it susceptible to loading malicious DLLs if placed in the same directory as the executable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Since AdwCleaner requires administrative privileges to run, a malicious DLL loaded through this vulnerability would also execute with administrative rights. This allows attackers to gain elevated privileges on the system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code by using a maliciously crafted DLL file with the same name as a legitimate DLL that the application attempts to load.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local File System:** The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in the same directory where the AdwCleaner executable resides before the application is executed. This would usually be the Downloads directory, if the user had downloaded the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have write access to the directory where the user saves the AdwCleaner executable (e.g., the Downloads folder) to place the malicious DLL.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker relies on the user running the AdwCleaner application, thereby triggering the loading of the malicious DLL.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by GÃ¼nter Born and reported to Malwarebytes on December 10, 2019.
*   The issue was fixed in AdwCleaner version 8.0.1 by enforcing the loading paths to the DLLs, meaning that the application will now load the DLLs only from the correct Windows folders.
*   The vulnerability affected AdwCleaner versions 7.0 up to 8.0.0

This is more detail than the official CVE description provides, as it explains the mechanism of DLL hijacking and its impact on AdwCleaner, including details about the fix.
