## Issue

The CBC Gem Android & iOS applications (Android version 9.24.0 and below, iOS version 9.24.0 and below) sends potentially sensitive information such as device model & resolution,
mobile carrier, days since first use, days since last use, total number of app launches, number of app launches since upgrade, and previous app session length, unencrypted to both first and third
party sites (Adobe Marketing Cloud, ScorecardResearch).
## Impact

An attacker who can monitor network traffic could capture potentially sensitive information about the user's device and viewing habits without their knowledge.
