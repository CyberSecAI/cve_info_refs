- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CBC Gem Android and iOS applications were sending potentially sensitive user information unencrypted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unencrypted transmission of user data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker monitoring network traffic can capture sensitive user information such as device model, resolution, mobile carrier, usage habits (days since first/last use, app launches, session length).
- **Attack vectors:** Network traffic interception.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to monitor network traffic.
