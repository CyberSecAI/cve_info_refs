The content is related to CVE-2019-19703.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ktor HTTP client, when configured to follow redirects, improperly resends authorization headers to the redirect location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `HttpRedirect` feature in Ktor client does not clear the `Authorization` header before making a redirect request.
- Leaking of `Authorization` header to an unintended host.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Sensitive authorization data, like basic auth credentials, can be exposed to unintended servers during HTTP redirects.
- This could lead to unauthorized access to resources on the redirected server, especially if the redirect target is controlled by a malicious actor.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can set up a server that redirects to another server.
- The victim client, configured to follow redirects, will send authorization data to the attacker's server during redirection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to set up a server that the victim's client might be redirected to. This might be possible by setting up a server that mimics the desired endpoint or through exploiting vulnerabilities in the system that performs redirects.
- The victim's client application must have `followRedirects` enabled.
