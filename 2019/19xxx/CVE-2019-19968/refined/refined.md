Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-19968

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in multiple areas of the Pandora FMS web application. Specifically, the application does not adequately filter user-supplied data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary weakness is the presence of stored XSS vulnerabilities in various modules of Pandora FMS.
  - Specifically, the Reporting Builder, Graph Builder, and Agent Management modules are affected.
  - Malicious JavaScript can be injected into fields within these modules.
  - The injected scripts are then stored in the application's database and executed when other users view the affected pages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with low-level user access could leverage these XSS vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the browsers of other users, potentially including administrators.
- **Account Compromise:** By stealing session cookies or performing other malicious actions via JavaScript, an attacker could gain control of other users' accounts, including administrator accounts.
- **System Compromise:** Chaining this vulnerability with other vulnerabilities, such as the remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2019-19681) as demonstrated in the provided video, could lead to full system compromise.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could use XSS to steal sensitive information, including user credentials, configuration data, and other information displayed in the application.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker can manipulate the application UI, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The vulnerabilities are exploited through the web interface of Pandora FMS.
- **Injected Malicious Code:** The attack involves injecting malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the vulnerable input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Level User Access:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account with low-level privileges on the Pandora FMS application to inject the malicious code.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Areas:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable modules and input fields.
- **Ability to Inject Code:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code into the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The content mentions that the vendor accepted these as valid findings and fixed them in version 743 of Pandora FMS.
- The provided content also references a video demonstrating a chained attack using these XSS vulnerabilities with CVE-2019-19681 (Remote Code Execution), indicating the potential for severe impact.
- The attacker is able to inject javascript code into these fields: Report Builder-> Create report, Graph Builder -> Create Graph, Resources-> Manage Agents -> Create.
