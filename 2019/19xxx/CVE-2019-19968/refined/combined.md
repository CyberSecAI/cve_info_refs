## Support My Love Projects

Your contribution means a lot to me. These research projects are my passion, and I have invested a lot of time and resources into them. Unfortunately, I do not have any external supporters, and I cover all the expenses myself.

Dealing with vendors, especially in the field of cybersecurity, can be challenging, and it's even more difficult in my country (Hungary). Your support helps me continue these projects and bring valuable results to the community.

If you appreciate my work, you can contribute in the following ways:

# Pandora FMS 7.xx Stored XSS vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-19968)

#pandorafms#hacking#rce#cve#xss

Last Modified: 2024.01.19.

If you find it valuable, you can support me by making a donation. [Donate now](https://k4m1ll0.com/donations.html).

 The vendor accepted it as a valid finding and they fixed them in Pandora FMS 743.

In December I found a "Remote Code Execution vulnerability" in Pandora FMS 7.xx (CVE-2019â19681).
According to the Vendor, it is not a vulnerability, but NVD/MITRE accepted it as a vulnerability. This CVE is in the DISPUTED state.

Since my purpose is helpful, I tried to find vulnerabilities that are "useful" for them.
So I changed my focus and this time my goal was to elevate my privileges from a low-level user to an admin user.

# Stored XSS vulnerabilities

I was sure there are other cases, but it was enough to demonstrate the problem. This was around Christmas and I got immediate positive feedback from the vendor. They accepted them as valid findings and they already fixed it in the v743 release.

Note: I used an older software version for demonstration, because I used the vendor provided VMWare Image.
