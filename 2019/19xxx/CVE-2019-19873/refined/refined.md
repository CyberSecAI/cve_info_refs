The provided document is a release note for APROL R4.2, which includes descriptions of new features, security enhancements, and bug fixes. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2019-19873, it does detail several security improvements that were implemented, many of which were independently found by Positive Technologies. These improvements address various vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown of the security-related information:

**Vulnerabilities Addressed:**
*   **FTP Service:** The FTP service, considered unsafe, was disabled by default in AutoYaST V4.2-030 and later. If enabled, anonymous access is disabled, and local users are restricted to their home directories. B&R recommends using SFTP or SCP instead.
*   **Finger Service:** The finger service, also deemed unsafe, was removed from AutoYaST V4.2-030 onward. The associated TCP port was also closed.
*   **SSH Access:** SSH access via password for the Linux superuser "root" is blocked. SSH access via certificates is still permitted. Unsuccessful SSH connection attempts are logged, and multiple failed attempts from the same IP address result in temporary blocking.
*   **VNC Access:** VNC access is now only possible in encrypted form using X.509 certificates, and only through the "TigerVNC" client, making connections with other VNC clients impossible.
*   **TbaseServer Memory Access Errors:** Multiple memory access issues in the TbaseServer were fixed by implementing additional pointer checks.
*   **LDAP Server Anonymous Access:** Anonymous access to the LDAP server, which previously allowed reading data (except passwords), is blocked.
*   **SQL Injection in EnMon:** A PHP script vulnerable to SQL injections was fixed to prevent arbitrary SQL command execution.
*   **Web Script Remote Execution:** Web scripts that allowed execution of arbitrary commands on the web server were secured.
*   **IosHttp Unencrypted Modification:** The ability to change PVs unencrypted via the IosHttp service and JSON interface was removed, requiring encrypted connections.
*   **AprolLoader Remote Execution:** The AprolLoader was secured against arbitrary command execution via a specific attack scenario.
*   **AprolSqlServer Vulnerabilities:** Several security issues were addressed in the AprolSqlServer, including:
    *   Arbitrary command execution
    *   Access to directories outside the working directory
    *   Authentication bypass
    *   Insufficient authentication options and memory leaks in the SimbaEngine SDK (used by AprolSqlServer).
*   **AprolCluster Command Injection:** The "AprolCluster" Python script vulnerability to arbitrary command injection using `sudo` was removed.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
*   The root causes are varied, including insecure services (FTP, finger), weak access controls (SSH, VNC, LDAP), coding errors leading to memory access issues, injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command), and insecure interfaces (IosHttp).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Insecure services (FTP, finger)
*   Unencrypted communication (VNC, IosHttp)
*   Lack of access controls (SSH, LDAP)
*   Memory access errors
*   Injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command)
*   Insufficient authentication

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Arbitrary command execution on the server
*   Unauthorized access to system data
*   Remote control of the system
*   Denial of service
*   Data breaches

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network access via insecure protocols (FTP, finger, unencrypted VNC)
*   Network access via SSH with compromised credentials
*   Malicious requests to web scripts
*   SQL injection through a vulnerable web interface
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities in system components (TbaseServer, AprolLoader, AprolSqlServer)
*   Command injection via scripts

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network access to the target system
*   Knowledge of vulnerable services and interfaces
*   Ability to craft malicious requests and commands
*   In some cases, valid user credentials (for example, to exploit SSH password authentication before it was disabled).

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document credits Positive Technologies for independently finding these vulnerabilities, indicating a collaborative approach to security.
*   B&R recommends disabling FTP service and using secure alternatives (SFTP, SCP).
*   The release notes emphasize the importance of using only the B&R recommended VNC client (TigerVNC) for secure connections.
*   The use of the utility "AprolSetSecurity" is suggested to enable or disable services.
*   The current status of these services is displayed in APROL SDM / area "Security information."
*   The document provides a good overview of the security enhancements made but does not contain specifics of CVE-2019-19873.

**Conclusion:**
The provided content does not specifically address CVE-2019-19873, but rather details a variety of security improvements made in APROL R4.2-05 and earlier versions that address multiple security issues, many of which are attributed to being found by Positive Technologies. These include disabling unsafe services, enforcing encryption, improving authentication, fixing memory access errors, and removing injection vulnerabilities. The document provides good technical information on the vulnerabilities and their fixes.
