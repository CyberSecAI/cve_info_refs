Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-19052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability**

*   **Memory Leak:** The root cause is a memory leak in the `gs_can_open()` function within the Linux kernel's `drivers/net/can/usb/gs_usb.c` file. This memory leak is triggered when the `usb_submit_urb()` function fails during the opening of a GS USB CAN interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**

*   **Insufficient Resource Management:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly release allocated resources (specifically, a USB Request Block - URB) when a USB transfer operation, initiated by  `usb_submit_urb()`, fails. This leads to an accumulation of allocated memory over time, as the resources are not freed on failure.
*  **Lack of Error Handling:** Specifically, if the URB submission fails, the allocated URB should be released and this step was missing resulting in the memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service attack. By repeatedly triggering the memory leak, an attacker can exhaust the available system memory, eventually leading to a system crash or instability due to memory exhaustion.
*   **Kernel Memory Exhaustion:** Continuous triggering of memory leaks can result in kernel memory exhaustion, leading to DoS.

**Attack Vectors**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a physically proximate attacker. This means the attacker must have some level of access to the system to interact with the USB subsystem.
*   **Triggering usb\_submit\_urb() failure:** Attackers can induce the memory leak by repeatedly calling usb_submit_urb() to create a high volume of memory allocation while ensuring that these allocations result in failures within the driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**

*   **Physical Proximity:** Attackers need to have physical access to the target system to manipulate USB devices.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker does not require root/admin level of access and this can be trigger by a user with low privileges.
*   **USB Interaction:**  Attackers need the ability to interact with USB devices/subsystem in order to expose the vulnerability by repeatedly opening the gs USB device causing the function `gs_can_open` to be called.
*   **Understanding of the CAN protocol**: The attacker needs some understanding of CAN protocols, at least to send specific inputs to the drivers to produce a failure state.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content shows that SUSE and Ubuntu addressed this issue in their respective Linux kernel packages. Suse indicates that the fix is 'Resolved' and the issue is rated as having a moderate severity.  Ubuntu indicates that the issue was addressed with the release of a security patch.
*  The vulnerability is present in the Linux kernel through version 5.3.11.
* Some resources discuss that the vulnerability is disputed because of the difficulty in controlling the failure at probe time.
*   The information from usn.ubuntu.com provides context that this vulnerability is included in a larger security update for several kernel vulnerabilities related to various network device drivers.

Based on the analysis, the content provides sufficient information about the root cause, vulnerability details, impact, attack vectors, and required attacker capabilities for CVE-2019-19052.
