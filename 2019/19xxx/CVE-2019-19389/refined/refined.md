  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2019-19389",
      "description": "The Ktor Coroutine based I/O Server implementation `io.ktor.client.engine.cio.CIO` is vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when constructing HTTP headers. Specifically, the Ktor library allows CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) characters to be inserted into header values. This could lead to an attacker injecting arbitrary HTTP headers and even a response body into the response.",
        "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-113: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting')"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform HTTP Response Splitting attacks, which can lead to various malicious activities, including:\n  * Cross-User Defacement\n  * Cache Poisoning\n  * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)\n  * Page Hijacking\n  * Leaking potentially sensitive header values.",
      "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves injecting malicious CRLF sequences into HTTP header values via user-provided input or when using the `call.respondRedirect` method with untrusted data.  Specifically, injecting \\r and \\n characters into a header value.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control or influence the data that is used to create the header values or redirect locations. This can include query parameters, form data, or any other input that is used by the vulnerable application to construct HTTP headers.",
      "poc": "The provided POC demonstrates how an attacker can insert arbitrary headers into the server's response by injecting CR/LF sequences into a header value. This can be used to inject XSS payloads and other malicious content."
    }
  ],
  "fixes": [
    {
      "version": "1.2.6",
      "details": "This vulnerability is fixed in Ktor version `1.2.6` by restricting the CIO HTTP parser so illegal names and values causing the request to be aborted, and by restricting API to not allow setting illegal headers via `HeadersBuilder` and server's `ResponseHeaders`."
