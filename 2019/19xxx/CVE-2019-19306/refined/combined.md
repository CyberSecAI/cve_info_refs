## CVE-2019-19306 – Reflected Cross-Site Scripting in ZOHO CRM Lead Magnet

![](/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/high.png)

Severity:High

#### Vendor

##### Zoho

#### Affected Product

##### Lead Magnet

#### CVE

##### CVE-2019-19306

#### Securin ID

##### 2019-CSW-03-1026

#### Status

##### Fixed

#### Date

##### October 14, 2019

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered on WordPress plugin ZOHO CRM Lead Magnet 1.6.9.1. An input variable vulnerable to XSS are âModule,â âEditShortcode,â and âLayoutNameâ in the Zoho CRM form creation page. A vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the WordPress plugin ZOHO CRM Lead magnet by providing XSS payload as a value for vulnerable variables.

### Proof of Concept **(POC)**:

Issue 1: By exploiting Cross-site scripting vulnerability, an attacker can quickly access the userâs session by stealing cookies and exploiting the user browser.

1. Log in to the application.
2. Install the [Zoho CRM Lead Magnet Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zoho-crm-forms/).

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-1(18).png)**Figure 01:* *Zoho CRM Lead Magnet.***

1. Configure the **client ID** and **secret key.**

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-2(17).png)***Figure 02:* *Client key and secret id are filled in Authenticating Zoho CRM Plugin.***

2. Click on the Create **New Form** button and fill the values and click on the **Next** button.

![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-3(16).png)

***Figure 03:* *New form in Zoho CRM Plugin.***

3. Add the payload <img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)> to the vulnerable parameters by intercepting the request in a proxy tool.

***Figure 04:* *Request with XSS payload sent to the server.***

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-5(10).png)***

***Figure 05**: Request and response captured in the proxy.***

3. Injected XSS payload is successfully executed when the user visits or reloads the page.

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-6(7).png)**Figure 06:* *The JavaScript is successfully executed in the victim browser context.***

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-7(4).png)**Figure 07:* *The WordPress application runs on version 5.2.3.***

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-8(1).png)**Figure 08:* *The WordPress Zoho CRM Lead Magnet Plugin Version: 1.6.9.1.***

***![](https://cybersecurityworks.com/howdymanage/uploads/image/zero-days/figures/fig-9(1).png)**Figure 09:* *The default cross-site scripting mitigation setting in wp.config file to prevent Cross-Site Scripting attacks.***

### Impact

An attacker can injectÂ malicious codes into a request andÂ the server returns the script to the client in the response using a crafted URL to reflect cross-site scripting (XSS) in a lead magnet of WordPress plugin CRM lead magnet pages.

### Remediations

Download the latest version and apply relevant patches advised as per vendor.

### Timeline

**Oct 13, 2019:** Discovered in WordPress (Zoho CRM Lead Magnet Plugin) Product.

**Oct 14, 2019:** Reported to WordPress plugin team.

I encountered a significant issue when using the Zoho CRM Lead Magnet plugin (version 1.7.8.4) in conjunction with ContactForm7 5.8.6 on WordPress. Upon activating the Zoho CRM Lead Magnet plugin without even configuring form field mappings, the email sending functionality becomes disabled, resulting in a 503 error response upon submission.This problem specifically arises in environments with PHP version 8.0.30.

There is no way to remove a field from a form. (According to their support person) So, once you add a field, the only way to remove it is to start over.
There is no hidden field support – like every other major form plugin. Upon asking support, was told that this would require modifying the wordpress code(?) and to talk to wordpress. (according to their support)
Good concept – a form plugin that directly integrates to the CRM. It fails in the fact that it was developed by people who do not know how to write plugins and a support team that doesn’t understand them. At best this could be considered a beta version, but given the lack of ability to remove fields and the clunky interface, it is probably closer to alpha. What is worse is that if you ask for support, there is a 50% chance that you are told that Zoho is not the producer of the plugin and you have to get to someone who knows better.
Avoid. Run away. Do not use.

I discourage anyone from using this plugin. When it works, it does what it should. When it breaks, don’t rely on Zoho for support. During two years of using the plugin, I’ve repeatedly been told by Zoho that it is simply not a Zoho product. Of course, it is managed and produced by the Zoho extensions team. And of course, occasionally I find someone at the Zoho Extensions team with time to investigate issues with this plugin, obviating the false claim from Zoho support teams that this is not a Zoho product.
Three years after launch the plugin only has 3000 documented installations, which falls well below the threshold for user interest that would encourage reliable developer support.
Zoho CRM email parsers not quite as efficient to set up, but if they break, they do not break functionality of live Webforms. I’ll probably work with Zoho to fix whatever is broken in this, but more likely I’ll be moving all my forms to an email parser for CRM integration.

# Details

ZOHO CRM Lead Magnet version 1.6.9.1

Bug Name: Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in WordPress Plugin

Product: ZOHO CRM Lead Magnet version 1.6.9.1

Version: 1.6.9.1

Last Updated: 14-10-2019

Homepage: <http://localhost/wordpress/>

Severity: High

Status: Fixed

Exploitation Requires Authentication?: yes

Vulnerable URL: <http://localhost/wordpress/wp-admin/admin.php?page=create-leadform-builder&__module=ManageShortcodes&__action=zcfCrmManageFieldsLists&onAction=onCreate&crmtype=crmformswpbuilder&module=Leads&EditShortcode=58H3N&LayoutName=Standard&formName=Unititled>

Vulnerable Variable: **Module & EditShortcode & LayoutName**

# Description:

A cross site scripting (XSS) attack can cause arbitrary code (java script) to run in a user’s browser while the browser is connected to a trusted web site. The application targets your application’s users and not the application itself, but it uses your application as the vehicle for the attack. XSS payload is executing when the user loads an create lead form page created in  **Zoho CRM Lead Magnet Version 1.6.9.1**

# Proof of concept: (POC)

**Issue 1:**

By exploiting a Cross-site scripting vulnerability an attacker easily gain access to user’s session by stealing cookies and also exploit the user browser.

1. Login to the application
2. Install [Zoho CRM Lead Magnet Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/zoho-crm-forms/)

[![Figure01_Zoho CRM Lead Magnet](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/66914484-81504d80-f034-11e9-97d9-7e5faa2fc32f.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13975575/66914484-81504d80-f034-11e9-97d9-7e5faa2fc32f.png)

**Figure 02:** client key and secret id are filled in Authenticating Zoho CRM Plugin

**Figure 03:** new form in Zoho CRM Plugin

5. Add the payload `<img src=x onerror=alert(document.cookie)>` to the vulnerable parameters by intercepting the request in a proxy tool.

6. Injected XSS payload is successfully executed when the user visits or reloads the page
