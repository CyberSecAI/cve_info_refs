{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure Password Storage vulnerability in the communication between Control-M/Agent and Control-M/Server when using the TCP protocol and handling output with an unsupported action.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure storage of sensitive information (passwords) in files.",
      "Use of TCP protocol without TLS which exposes credentials."
    ],
    "impact": "Compromise of sensitive information, such as passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over the system.",
    "attack_vectors": "Attacker would need to intercept the communication between Control-M/Agent and Control-M/Server when using TCP protocol and an unsupported action is triggered.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept the network traffic between the Control-M/Agent and Control-M/Server or have access to the file system where sensitive information is stored."
  },
    "affected_product": "Control-M/Agent",
  "affected_version": "7.0.00.000",
  "advisory_id": "usd-2019-0066",
  "vendor_status": "Fixed (according to vendor)",
   "security_risk": "Conditional. The risk is considered conditional because the vulnerability is more easily exploited if TLS is disabled. However, since real-world configurations can exist without TLS, the criticality increases when TLS is disabled."
