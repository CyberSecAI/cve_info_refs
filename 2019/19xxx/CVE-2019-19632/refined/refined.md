The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19632.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `/login` endpoint in the Big Monitoring Fabric application is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the `/login` endpoint.
- The application does not sanitize user-supplied input (specifically, usernames) when logging failed login attempts to the `/login_history` endpoint.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the login history.
- When an administrator accesses the `/login_history` page, the malicious JavaScript code executes, potentially leading to:
  - Creation of a backdoor administrative user.
  - Complete compromise of the Big Monitoring Fabric application.
  - SSH console access to the affected system through the creation of an administrative user with a known password that can be used to change the default admin password.

**Attack vectors:**
- An unauthenticated attacker sends a crafted login request with an XSS payload embedded in the username.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application's `/login` endpoint.
- No prior authentication or privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability.
