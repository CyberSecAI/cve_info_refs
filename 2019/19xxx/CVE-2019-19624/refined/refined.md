Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an incorrect calculation of pyramid scales within the `DISOpticalFlow` algorithm in OpenCV. Specifically, the `coarsest_scale` variable could be less than the `finest_scale` variable, or even less than 0 for small images. This violates an assumption in the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds access:** When `coarsest_scale` is less than `finest_scale`, the loop that calculates optical flow doesn't execute and the code attempts to access `Ux` and `Uy` arrays out-of-bounds, leading to a crash.
*   **Incorrect Pyramid Level Calculation:** The logic for selecting pyramid scales was flawed, particularly when dealing with small images. The code did not account for cases where the calculated `coarsest_scale` would be less than the intended `finest_scale`, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Crash:** The primary impact is a segmentation fault (segfault) or crash of the application when processing small images. This could cause denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker could provide specially crafted small images as input to the `DISOpticalFlow` algorithm, triggering the vulnerability and causing the application to crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to have the ability to supply input images to an application that utilizes the vulnerable `DISOpticalFlow` implementation within OpenCV.

**Additional details:**

*   The issue was identified in OpenCV version 4.0.
*   The fix involves:
    *   Limiting the coarsest level to be greater than or equal to zero.
    *   Adjusting the finest level calculation based on the coarsest level, instead of using constant pre-sets.
    *   Adding a check for `coarsest_scale < 0` and throwing an error to prevent out-of-bounds access.
    *   A new `autoSelectPatchSizeAndScales` method was created to determine patch size and scales based on the image width.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `d1615ba11a93062b1429fce9f0f638d1572d3418`.
*   The issue was reported in issue #14554 and fixed by PR #14641.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when using images smaller than 12 pixels in either width or height.
