      "root_cause": "A Django model admin displayed a parent model with related model inlines where a user had view-only permissions for the parent model but edit permissions for the inline model. Submitting forms for the inline model would trigger the parent model's `save()` method, which could invoke pre- and post-save signal handlers.",
