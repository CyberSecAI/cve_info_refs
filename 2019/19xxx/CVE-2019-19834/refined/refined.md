### Summary:
The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in Ruckus Wireless access points, including CVE-2019-19834. This CVE relates to a CLI jailbreak vulnerability.

### CVE-2019-19834 - CLI Jailbreak:

*   **Vulnerability:** CLI Jailbreak
*   **Root Cause:** The `ruckus_cli2` binary, used as an alternative shell, has a hidden command `!v54!` that pops a `busybox` shell but requires the device's serial number. The `exec` command within `ruckus_cli2` is vulnerable to path traversal.
*   **Attack Vector:** By exploiting the path traversal vulnerability in the `exec` command, an attacker can bypass the intended shell and execute arbitrary commands, leading to a `busybox` shell.
*   **Impact:** Attacker gains a `busybox` shell, achieving code execution on the device.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires admin credentials to access the CLI.
