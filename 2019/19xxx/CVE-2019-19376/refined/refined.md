The content relates to CVE-2019-19376.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A malformed request submitted to the Team API, for either create or modify, bypasses input validation, leading to a null reference exception when the team data is read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper input validation in the Team API.
- The code that reads team data does not handle invalid data, resulting in a null reference exception.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application level denial of service condition. The server APIs cannot load permissions, causing an error for all incoming requests.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malformed request to the Team API. This can be done through the API, but not through the portal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An authenticated user with TeamEdit permission is required.
