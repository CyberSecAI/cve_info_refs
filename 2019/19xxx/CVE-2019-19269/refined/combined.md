Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-65a983b8b6
2019-12-08 01:02:51.298843
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 2.fc30
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This update addresses a number of bugs affecting processing of CRLs in mod\_tls,
including possible null pointer dereferences and missing some checks. Thanks to
Lionel Debroux for reporting them.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

# CVE-2019-19270

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-19269.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-19271.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-19270 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19270)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in tls\_verify\_crl in ProFTPD through 1.3.6b. Failure to check for the appropriate field of a CRL entry (checking twice for subject, rather than once for subject and once for issuer) prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account, and can allow clients whose certificates have been revoked to proceed with a connection to the server.

To fully support this feature, the proftpd package must include the pam_keyinit.so module in its /etc/pam.d/proftpd configuration file.

I lost track of this: I'd add "force" as ftp will cahnge from "root" to the user that wants to download files. That user might need access to his(her keys, so a new keyring MUST be built (possibly linking to existing keyrings of that user). ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1144056#c4)  Josef Möllers   2019-12-12 14:40:02 UTC  ``` See <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/734642> ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1144056#c5)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-12-29 23:40:42 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1144056) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/759945> 15.1+Backports:SLE-15+Backports:SLE-15-SP1 / proftpd ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1144056#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-01-13 20:12:01 UTC  ``` openSUSE-SU-2020:0031-1: An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes is now available.

## Description

![@msg7086](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/206155?v=4&size=48)[msg7086](https://github.com/msg7086)opened [on May 9, 2019](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/807#issue-442375790)
### What I Did

I configured TLS on ProFTPD using SSLv23, and FlashFXP (with only TLSv1.2 support) does not work with it. In fact, any client that does not use TLSv1.3 does not work with it.

### What I Expected/Wanted

Server accepts connections for both TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3 given that SSLv23 means "all versions".

*or*

Document the behavior that SSLv23 no longer works in this way.

## Description

![@debrouxl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8375?v=4&size=48)[debrouxl](https://github.com/debrouxl)opened [on Nov 4, 2019](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/861#issue-517252879)

This is the 4th of 4 bugs in the tls\_verify\_crl() function. The code fails to take into account an empty CRL, for which sk\_X509\_REVOKED\_value() returned NULL in my tests. It proceeds to dereferencing the NULL pointer, crashing the application.

My patch is as follows:

```
@@ -6005,7 +6014,8 @@
         ASN1_INTEGER *sn;

         revoked = sk_X509_REVOKED_value(X509_CRL_get_REVOKED(crl), j);
+        if (!revoked) continue;
 #if OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x10100000L
         sn = X509_REVOKED_get0_serialNumber(revoked);
 #else
         sn = revoked->serialNumber;

```

Both of the other code bases which I noticed were getting the issuer CRL lookup right (second bug, issue [#859](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/859)) fail to check the return value against NULL as well:

<https://github.com/CESNET/libnetconf2/blob/master/src/session_server_tls.c>

<https://github.com/copiousfreetime/stunnel/blob/master/src/verify.c> (outdated stunnel < 5.24)

FWIW, 4 years ago, stunnel got rid of custom CRL handling code and started relying on OpenSSL's built-in handling instead. That was between 5.23 and 5.24, compare src/verify.c from <https://www.usenix.org.uk/mirrors/stunnel/archive/5.x/stunnel-5.23.tar.gz> and <https://www.usenix.org.uk/mirrors/stunnel/archive/5.x/stunnel-5.24.tar.gz> .

I hit this crash in the summer of 2018, after fixing the first crash (issue [#858](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/858)) when dealing with TLS CRLs using CentOS 7's ProFTPD 1.3.5e package against OpenSSL 1.0.2\*.

I quickly reported the issues privately, but ProFTPD's TLS CRL handling remains broken on all branches more than a year later... I'm aware that TLS CRLs are highly unpopular, and that only system administrators are supposed to define them, but clearly, low-profile responsible disclosure didn't work here :)

Public reports, and CVE ID assignments (for which I'll use this issue as reference), piling onto the recent higher risk issue [#846](https://github.com/proftpd/proftpd/issues/846) ([CVE-2019-18217](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5446-jrwr-x7c6 "CVE-2019-18217")) and older vulnerabilities should help the downstream propagation of all fixes, at least if any downstream provides security support for ProFTPD.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for proftpd fixes the following issues:
\* GeoIP has been discontinued by Maxmind (boo#1156210) This update removes
module build for geoip see
<https://support.maxmind.com/geolite-legacy-discontinuation-notice/>
- CVE-2019-19269: Fixed a NULL pointer dereference may occur when
validating the certificate of a client connecting to the server
(boo#1157803)
- CVE-2019-19270: Fixed a Failure to check for the appropriate field of a
CRL entry prevents some valid CRLs from being taken into account
(boo#1157798)
- CVE-2019-18217: Fixed remote unauthenticated denial-of-service due to
incorrect handling of overly long commands (boo#1154600 gh#846)
Update to 1.3.6b
\* Fixed pre-authentication remote denial-of-service issue (Issue #846).
\* Backported fix for building mod\_sql\_mysql using MySQL 8 (Issue #824).
Update to 1.3.6a:
\* Fixed symlink navigation (Bug#4332).
\* Fixed building of mod\_sftp using OpenSSL 1.1.x releases (Issue#674).
\* Fixed SITE COPY honoring of <Limit> restrictions (Bug#4372).
\* Fixed segfault on login when using mod\_sftp + mod\_sftp\_pam (Issue#656).
\* Fixed restarts when using mod\_facl as a static module
\* Add missing Requires(pre): group(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Add missing Requires(pre): user(ftp) for Leap 15 and Tumbleweed
(boo#1155834)
\* Use pam\_keyinit.so (boo#1144056)
- Reduce hard dependency on systemd to only that which is necessary for
building and installation.
update to 1.3.6:
\* Support for using Redis for caching, logging; see the
doc/howto/Redis.html documentation.
\* Fixed mod\_sql\_postgres SSL support (Issue #415).
\* Support building against LibreSSL instead of OpenSSL (Issue #361).
\* Better support on AIX for login restraictions (Bug #4285).
\* TimeoutLogin (and other timeouts) were not working properly for SFTP
connections (Bug#4299).
\* Handling of the SIGILL and SIGINT signals, by the daemon process, now
causes the child processes to be terminated as well (Issue #461).
\* RPM .spec file naming changed to conform to Fedora guidelines.
\* Fix for "AllowChrootSymlinks off" checking each component for symlinks
(CVE-2017-7418).
New Modules:
\* mod\_redis, mod\_tls\_redis, mod\_wrap2\_redis With Redis now supported as a
caching mechanism, similar to Memcache, there are now Redis-using
modules: mod\_redis (for configuring the Redis connection information),
mod\_tls\_redis (for caching SSL sessions and OCSP information using
Redis), and mod\_wrap2\_redis (for using ACLs stored in Redis).
Changed Modules:
\* mod\_ban: The mod\_ban module's BanCache directive can now use Redis-based
caching; see doc/contrib/mod\_ban.html#BanCache.
-New Configuration Directives
\* SQLPasswordArgon2, SQLPasswordScrypt
The key lengths for Argon2 and Scrypt-based passwords are now
configurable via these new directives; previously, the key length had been
hardcoded to be 32 bytes, which is not interoperable with all other
implementations (Issue #454).
Changed Configuration Directives
\* AllowChrootSymlinks When "AllowChrootSymlinks off" was used, only the
last portion of the DefaultRoot path would be checked to see if it was a
symlink. Now, each component of the DefaultRoot path will be checked to
see if it is a symlink when "AllowChrootSymlinks off" is used.
\* Include The Include directive can now be used within a <Limit> section,
e.g.: <Limit LOGIN> Include /path/to/allowed.txt DenyAll </Limit> API
Changes
\* A new JSON API has been added, for use by third-party modules.

| [@computersalat](https://github.com/computersalat) Hopefully it does, but you may need to build from source from the 1.3.6 branch until a release happens. I don't think the fix has been backported to 1.3.5 yet. |

| If I installed 1.3.6 when it was released via RPM, would that version be vulnerable as well? From what I can read on NVD it's only up to 1.3.5b? |

| [@benlarsendk](https://github.com/benlarsendk) 1.3.6 is vulnerable as well. You will need to either build a new RPM from the 1.3.6 branch (you can refer to `contrib/dist/travis/docker-rpmbuild.sh` for how to do this) or wait for your package maintainer to do so. |

| [@Castaglia](https://github.com/Castaglia) Today I built a Debian package using source code of 1.3.5e and noticed that the issue is still reproducible. At least I can still create a malicious.php as described in Bug 4372. Please double check. Thanks! |

Today I built a Debian package using source code of 1.3.5e and noticed that the issue is still reproducible. At least I can still create a malicious.php as described in Bug 4372. Please double check. Thanks! Some additional information: There were other issues related to mod\_copy, but CVE-2019-12815 is specific to the issue reported in <http://bugs.proftpd.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4372> . The reporters (Tobias Mädel) blogpost about it is at <https://tbspace.de/cve201912815proftpd.html> . The CVE description should always be taken with a salt of grain. It might just reflect the information available at a given point in time or might reflect which versions were tested, but not mentioning further followup versions in a branch does not necessarly mean it was fixed after the mentioned version (unless it is clearly stated that the issue is fixed in version x.y). Sorry for the lengthly excurse, but I hope it is of benefit for all following this issue as there was some confusion on which are the fixed versions. At time of writing there is the fix commited but there is no upstream version which would contain already the fix. Hope this helps :) If the fix additionally to on top of the 1.3.6 series could be backported to the 1.3.5 series that would help downstreams shipping this version :) Actually for Debian stretch Hilmar Preusse did backport the changes, see <https://bugs.debian.org/932453> but in Debian we have not yet releases a so called DSA, because the version for 1.3.5 backport shows a strange behaviour. When trying to reproduce the issue, the connection just terminates (plugging effectively the issue, but for the 1.3.6 version it returns correctly a permission denied and connection remains intact). There might thus missed some prerequeisite commits for backports to the 1.3.5 series in e.g. the error handling or so. |

It wasn't a backport what I did. I simply adapted the patch we got in this pull request so it applies to the source tree and compilation runs OK. As said: I didn't even do functional testing. ;-( |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-bfacf1e958
2019-12-08 01:16:01.293717
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : proftpd
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.3.6b
Release : 2.fc31
URL : <http://www.proftpd.org/>
Summary : Flexible, stable and highly-configurable FTP server
Description :
ProFTPD is an enhanced FTP server with a focus toward simplicity, security,
and ease of configuration. It features a very Apache-like configuration
syntax, and a highly customizable server infrastructure, including support for
multiple 'virtual' FTP servers, anonymous FTP, and permission-based directory
visibility.

This package defaults to the standalone behavior of ProFTPD, but all the
needed scripts to have it run by systemd instead are included.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update addresses a number of bugs affecting processing of CRLs in mod\_tls,
including possible null pointer dereferences and missing some checks. Thanks to
Lionel Debroux for reporting them.
