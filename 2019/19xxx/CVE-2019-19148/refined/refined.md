Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of incoming authentication/authorization data on Tellabs Optical Line Terminal (OLT) devices. Specifically, the system fails to properly sanitize or validate input provided during login attempts. This allows for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands via the username field during Telnet and SSH login attempts. The injected commands are executed by the system, granting the attacker control over the device.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system lacks proper input validation or sanitization when processing the username during login, which is the root cause of the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the target device with root privileges, granting complete control over the system.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker can then install malware, modify configurations, steal data, or disrupt the device's normal operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Telnet:** The primary vector is through Telnet, where the attacker injects a malicious command into the username field during the login process.
*   **SSH:**  Similar to telnet, the vulnerability can be triggered through SSH logins with a malicious payload, after a few failed authentication attempts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Telnet or SSH interface of the vulnerable Tellabs OLT device.
*   **Basic Network Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of basic networking concepts, including how to initiate Telnet or SSH connections and set up a netcat listener for the reverse shell.
*   **Command Injection Techniques:** The attacker should know the techniques for command injection to execute malicious commands through the vulnerable input.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided github content also lists specific vulnerable versions and the patched versions of the Tellabs OLT software.
*   The content indicates this vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
*   The content also includes example command sequences to trigger this vulnerability.
*   The vendor has released patches (SR30.1 and SR31.1) to address the issue.

This vulnerability is similar to, and inspired by, the "ShellShock" vulnerability in Bash.
