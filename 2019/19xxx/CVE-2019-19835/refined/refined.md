Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19835:

**CVE-2019-19835:** The provided information describes multiple vulnerabilities in Ruckus access points, but the specific vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-19835 is the SSRF vulnerability in the `zap` executable.

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `zap` executable allows a user-controlled server IP address, without proper sanitization. This allows the `zap` tool to send network traffic to an arbitrary IP address which could be abused for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SSRF vulnerability in the `zap` executable.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially scan internal networks or interact with other services by abusing the vulnerable `zap` tool as a proxy.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending an unauthenticated HTTP request to the web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP request to the `/tools/_cmdstat.jsp` endpoint with a valid structure that uses the `zap` tool. The attacker does not require prior authentication to reach the vulnerable code.
