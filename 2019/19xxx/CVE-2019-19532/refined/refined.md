Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-19532:

**Relates to CVE:** Yes

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Out-of-bounds write bugs in the Linux kernel HID drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The HID drivers do not properly validate device metadata on attachment.
*   This leads to out-of-bounds writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of service (system crash)
*   Possible arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Malicious USB device.
*   A physically proximate attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   Physical proximity to the target system.
*   Ability to attach a malicious USB device to the target system.

**Affected Files:**

*   drivers/hid/hid-axff.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-dr.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-emsff.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-gaff.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-holtekff.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-lg2ff.c

*   drivers/hid/hid-sony.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-tmff.c
*   drivers/hid/hid-zpff.c

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug is triggered during device attachment.
*   The syzbot fuzzer discovered the bug.
*   The Suse information rates the severity as Moderate.
*   The Ubuntu USN indicates the attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code.
*   The commit log provides a potential fix for HID drivers to check if the list of hid\_inputs for the hid\_device is nonempty before allowing it to be used.
