Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-19211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient filtering of multiple parameters used by the `/dolibarr/htdocs/user/card.php` file within the Dolibarr ERP/CRM application. These parameters are reflected in the application's output without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The application takes user-supplied input via several parameters and echoes it back in the response without proper encoding. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that would execute in the context of a user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities:
  - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing cookies or session tokens to impersonate the victim.
  - **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information within the application.
  - **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to a website that downloads malware.
  - **Defacement:** Altering the look and feel of the application.
  - **Phishing:** Displaying a fake login form to steal credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in one of the vulnerable parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a victim into clicking the malicious URL, typically through phishing emails, malicious links on websites, or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External Attacker:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the application.
- **Ability to create or manipulate URLs:** The attacker must be able to create a URL containing the malicious payload.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker must convince a victim to access the crafted URL.

The following parameters were identified as vulnerable:
- lastname
- firstname
- office_phone
- user_mobile
