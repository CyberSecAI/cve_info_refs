### CVE-2019-19982
The content is related to the CVE.
- **Vulnerability:** Unauthenticated Option Creation
- **Root cause:** The Email Subscribers & Newsletters plugin had an onboarding process that, when skipped, created a new option in the database. There were no access controls in place for skipping this process.
- **Attack vector:** An unauthenticated user could send a request to `admin-post.php` or `admin-ajax.php` with the `es_skip` parameter set to `1` and the `option_name` parameter set to the desired value.
- **Impact:** This allowed any unauthenticated user to create a new option with the name `ig_es_ob_skip_[option_name]` with a default value of `yes`. This option could later be modified using a CSRF vulnerability.
- **Affected versions:** <= 4.2.2
- **Patched version:** 4.2.3
