Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19906:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   The provided content consistently confirms that CVE-2019-19906 is an off-by-one error in the `_sasl_add_string()` function within the Cyrus SASL library, which could be triggered by a maliciously crafted LDAP packet. This aligns with the basic descriptions found in the different sources.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Off-by-One Error:** The core issue is an off-by-one error in the `_sasl_add_string` function located in `lib/common.c` of the Cyrus SASL library. This function is responsible for adding strings to a buffer. The vulnerability arises because the code calculates the required buffer size incorrectly, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
*   **Incorrect String Length Calculation:** Specifically, the `strlen()` call used to compute the string length does not account for the null terminator, resulting in allocating one byte less than needed. This leads to an out-of-bounds write when adding the null terminator.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** This vulnerability allows writing data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
*   **Memory Corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can lead to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most commonly reported impact is a denial-of-service, as the out-of-bounds write can cause a crash in the application using the Cyrus SASL library. The reports show that `slapd` (OpenLDAP) crashes when this vulnerability is triggered.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution (Limited):** While not explicitly demonstrated or confirmed in the provided content, there is a potential for arbitrary code execution although this is said to be difficult due to the presence of assertions that generally lead to crashes rather than arbitrary code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability is triggered by a malformed LDAP packet, indicating a network-based attack vector.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication as per description on the openldap.org bug report.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely, implying they don't need local access to the affected system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires the ability to send a specially crafted LDAP packet to the target server using a network connection, typically on port 389.

**7. Technical Details:**

*   **Vulnerable Function:** `_sasl_add_string` function in `lib/common.c` of the cyrus-sasl library.
*  **Specific Code Change**: A fix has been developed by adding +1 to the strlen calculation, this way the null terminator is also written to memory and no OOB occurs.

**Summary of Findings:**

CVE-2019-19906 is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability caused by an off-by-one error in the `_sasl_add_string()` function in the Cyrus SASL library. It allows a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service, with limited potential for arbitrary code execution, by sending a malformed LDAP packet. Patches for this vulnerability were deployed by multiple vendors such as Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Red Hat and Apple, as described within the provided documents.
