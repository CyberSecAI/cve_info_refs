Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-19387:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the `app/fifo_list/fifo_interactive.php` file of FusionPBX.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input passed through the `c` parameter in the URL. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of the user's browser session when they access the vulnerable page. This could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Credential theft
    *   Other unauthorized actions within the application

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL. The attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript within the `c` parameter, and when a user clicks on the link, the malicious script executes in the browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and entice a user to visit the link. No authentication is explicitly required, so the attacker could be an unauthenticated, external attacker, though the exploitation of the vulnerability would require a victim user to click on the malicious link.
*   The attacker needs to be able to construct the malicious script payload.

**Additional Details**
* The vulnerable code is located at `/app/fifo_list/fifo_interactive.php`
* The vulnerable parameter is `c`
* The proof of concept URL is: `<https://172.16.19.160/app/fifo_list/fifo_interactive.php?c=123%27;alert(document.domain);//>`
* The fix can be found at: `<https://github.com/fusionpbx/fusionpbx/commit/44edbfe7a7e256d1b80448026617365a40c92c61>`
    * The fix is to use the `$fifo_name` variable instead of the `$_REQUEST['c']` variable in the `fifo_interactive.php` file.

The provided information offers details consistent with the description of CVE-2019-19387, specifically outlining the vulnerable file, parameter, and demonstrating a proof-of-concept.
