Based on the provided write-up, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-19014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `www` user, which has gained shell access after exploiting the backup restore function, is granted overly permissive `sudo` privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Overly Permissive Sudoers File:** The `sudoers` file allows the `www` user to execute a large number of commands as root without a password.  Specifically `chown`, `chmod`, which can be used for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker who has gained shell access as the `www` user can easily escalate their privileges to root. This allows complete control over the system.
    
**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromise `www` user:** This requires exploiting another vulnerability to gain initial access, specifically the backup restore vulnerability mentioned in the write-up.
*  **Sudo abuse**: Once the attacker has a shell as www, they can use the sudo commands listed in the `sudoers` file to escalate to root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have first gained access to the system with the privileges of `www` user, usually through exploiting a prior vulnerability like the backup restore vulnerability mentioned in the write-up to gain a web shell.
*   The attacker needs no special capabilities or credentials to escalate to root after achieving that initial access as `www` user.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The write-up notes that there are "hundreds of other ways probably" to escalate to root due to the numerous sudo commands allowed for the www user, which indicates a significant flaw in the system's security configuration.
