Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how the Ceph RADOS Gateway (RGW) daemon handles S3 requests, specifically a specially crafted HTTP `Content-Length` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Improper handling of the `Content-Length` header in HTTP requests.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered through S3 requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Remote Denial of Service (DoS) against the Ceph RADOS Gateway server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Sending a specially crafted HTTP request with a malicious `Content-Length` header to the Ceph RGW server.
*   This attack is performed remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated to send requests to the Ceph RGW server.
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Ceph RGW service.

**Additional Details:**

*   The bug report indicates that this flaw primarily affects Red Hat Ceph Storage 3. Upstream versions of Ceph and Ceph packages in RHEL 7 and 8 are not affected.
*   A mitigation strategy is described in comment 3, involving stopping the service, creating a systemd service, and adding firewall rules.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in RHSA-2019:4353 and RHSA-2019:4357.
*   The fix is included in `ceph-12.2.12-83.el7cp` and `ceph_12.2.12-76redhat1`.
