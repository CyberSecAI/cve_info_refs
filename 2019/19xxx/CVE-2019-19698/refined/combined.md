# SEGV in function wav\_content\_read in libwav.c

Tested in Ubuntu 14.04, 32bit

I use the [file](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang/security/blob/master/libwav/wav_gain_crash_SEGV_wav_content_read.wav) and the following command:

```
./wav_gain wav_gain_crash_SEGV_wav_content_read.wav test.wav
```

and get:

```
Segmentation fault (core dumped)

```

I use **valgrind** to analysis the bug and get the below information:

```

I use **gcc 4.8** and **AddressSanitizer** to build libwav, this [file](https://github.com/xiaoxiongwang/security/blob/master/libwav/wav_gain_crash_SEGV_wav_content_read.wav) can cause SEGV signal in function wav\_content\_read when running the wav\_gain in folder tools/wav\_gain with the following command:

```
./wav_gain wav_gain_crash_SEGV_wav_content_read.wav test.wav
```

This is the ASAN information:

```
