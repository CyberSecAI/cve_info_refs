The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19826.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `Views Dynamic Fields` Drupal module, specifically within the `views_handler_filter_dynamic_fields.inc` file. The module uses `unserialize()` on user-supplied input without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure deserialization: The module deserializes data received from the `field_names` and `combined` parameters in the exposed input using the `unserialize()` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP objects.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file deletion: By injecting a malicious object of type `Archive_Tar`, an attacker can trigger the deletion of arbitrary files on the server due to the destructor of the object calling `drupal_unlink` on the file path specified within the `_temp_tarname` field of the object.
- Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE): The report mentions that depending on the classes loaded, the vulnerability could potentially lead to RCE due to the nature of unserialization.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests, specifically by injecting a serialized object into the `field_names` or `combined` parameters. The specific request parameters are exposed via the Views module.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server where the vulnerable module is installed.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the structure of the serialized object to craft a payload that exploits the vulnerability.
