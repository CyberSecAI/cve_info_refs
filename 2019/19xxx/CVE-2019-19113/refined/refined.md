The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19113.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `NewBeeMallGoodsMapper.xml` file where the `${keyword}` parameter is used directly in the SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code uses string concatenation to build the SQL query with user-supplied input (`keyword`), making it vulnerable to SQL injection. The use of `${}` in MyBatis allows for direct string substitution, without any escaping or parameterization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `keyword` parameter. This could lead to:
- Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database)
- Data modification (altering or deleting data)
- Denial of service (potentially crashing the database or making it unavailable)
- Privilege escalation (if the database user has sufficient privileges)
- Other malicious activity allowed by the database server

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the `keyword` parameter in the search functionality. By crafting a malicious URL that includes SQL injection payload in the `keyword` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not need any special privileges, an unauthenticated user can exploit this vulnerability by sending the correct HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.
