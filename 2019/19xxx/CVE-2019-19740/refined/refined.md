*   **Data Modification/Deletion:** An attacker could also modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues and potential disruption of services.
*   **System Compromise:** In some cases, SQL injection could lead to further system compromise if the database server has insufficient security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the "CampaignID" parameter when interacting with the "Campaign.Get" function. This can be done through web requests or API calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Oempro application to send manipulated requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   **Basic Web/API knowledge:** The attacker should know how to craft HTTP requests or use API clients to send malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both Oempro 4.7 and 4.8.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Bruno de Barros Bulle, and the information was posted on GitHub.
