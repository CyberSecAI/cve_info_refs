# Dradis Pro Version 3.4.1

By:
[Florian Nivette, Senior Security Consultant](https://bishopfox.com/authors/florian-nivette)

![Gauge reading medium severity](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Images/channels/blog/featured-images/Medium-Risk-Advisory-Featured.jpg)

Share

## DRADIS PRO ADVISORY SUMMARY

This advisory describes an identified vulnerability in the Dradis Pro application Version 3.4.1. One medium-risk vulnerability was identified within the application.

### Impact

The API of Dradis Pro does not properly apply authorization control to project endpoints, which allows any user to access the content of a project, including the vulnerability description. This exposes sensitive information to users who are not part of the project team.

### Medium Risk Level

| Product Vendor | Product Name | Affected Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dradis | Dradis Pro application | 3.4.1 |

### Product Description

Dradis Pro is a collaborative reporting application. The projectâs official website is <https://dradis.com>. The latest version of the application is 3.5.0.

### Vulnerabilities List:

One vulnerability was identified within the Dradis Pro application:

INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE

### Solution

Update to version 3.5.0

### Credits

* Bastian Faure, Security Associate, Bishop Fox
* [Florian Nivette](https://bishopfox.com/authors/florian-nivette), Managing Security Associate, Bishop Fox

### Timeline

1. Initial Discovery: 12/03/2019
2. Contact with vendor: 12/04/2019
3. Vendor released patched version 3.5.0: 12/19/2019

## VULNERABILITY

### INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-19946 | Medium | Information Disclosure | Remote |

The Dradis Pro application was affected by one insecure direct object reference vulnerability (IDOR). These vulnerabilities allowed any user to extract project content through the API to and disclose sensitive information about vulnerabilities affecting Dradis clients.

The vulnerability was located on the `/prop/api/issues/`Â endpoint. This attack can be demonstrated with the following payload:

```
GET /pro/api/issues/ HTTP/1.1
Host: dradis.pro.domain
Connection: close
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Accept: */*
Dradis-Project-Id: PROJECT ID]
Authorization: Token token="[REDACTED]
```

FIGURE 1 - Payload used to access project content

This could lead to leaking sensitive information related to clients.
