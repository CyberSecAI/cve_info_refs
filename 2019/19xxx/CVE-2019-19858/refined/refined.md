Based on the provided content, which is a commit diff from a GitHub repository, the changes are related to escaping output in the `add_user.haml`, `add_user_report.haml`, and `list_user.haml` files. Specifically, the `:escaped` filter is being added to output user-controlled data in order to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The original code was displaying user-controlled data in HTML templates without proper escaping. This could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by manipulating user-controlled fields. This could result in session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement of the website, or other malicious activities on the user's browser.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript via fields like usernames, report names or authors

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to manipulate user-controlled data that is displayed in the vulnerable views. This could be achieved by creating a user with a malicious username, or crafting a report with a malicious name, and then have another user view the created/edited content.

**Specific changes in the diff:**
- `views/add_user.haml`: Added `#{env['rack.session'][:csrf]}` which will not be rendered to the user.
- `views/add_user_report.haml`:
  - Added `:escaped` filter to `#{user}` outputting user names
- `views/list_user.haml`:
  - Added `:escaped` filter to `#{user.username}` outputting usernames.
  - Added `:escaped` filter to `#{user.type} / #{user.auth_type}` outputting user type and authentication type.

These changes indicate that the commit is aimed at fixing XSS vulnerabilities by ensuring that all user-controlled data displayed in the mentioned views is properly escaped before rendering to the page.

The changes described in the content are likely to remediate the issue described in CVE-2019-19858.
