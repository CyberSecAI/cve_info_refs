{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The DSA signing process uses the BEEA algorithm for modular inversion of the nonce. This process is vulnerable to side-channel attacks such as cache and power fluctuations that could leak the nonce.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Side-channel vulnerability in DSA signing operations."
    ],
    "impact": "Potential leakage of the nonce through side channels, leading to potential compromise of the DSA signature.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Side-channel attacks such as cache and power fluctuations during DSA signing."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to perform sophisticated monitoring of cache and/or power fluctuations."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Blinding was added for DSA signing operations which makes the operation more resistant to side-channel attacks"
  ],
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2019-19963",
    "details": "This content provides more details regarding the fix of this vulnerability, which is related to adding blinding to the DSA signature process in order to mitigate side channel attacks."
