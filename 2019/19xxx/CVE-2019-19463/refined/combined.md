June 11, 2020The app is a total joke, does not record steps everyday. I can see 8000 steps in the band and an annoying "No activity" In the app. It doesn't track my sleep. Ever since I got it (4 days ago) it only tracked 2 random hours as I was awake for the rest of the night. Reading other reviews I understand this is just a faulty update that should be fixed, therefore I really hope it will be done soon as this is quite annoying. Another thing I don't like is that resting calories are not tracked26 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/EGemoI2NTXmTsBVtJqk8jxF9rh8ApRWfsIMQSt2uE4OcpQqbFu7f7NbTK05lx80nuSijCz7sc3a277R67g=s32-rw)A Google user*more\_vert*

May 9, 2019JHFC! Did the developers even glance at the new May update before shipping it? DISCONNECTS AND LOSES MI BAND 3 WORKOUT DATA (never happened before the update), dates are localised two different ways (m/d and d/m), a useless line graph for daily steps, text with no spaces, a missing weight value, mixed up colour schemes, swipe between tabs only works in some places, unable to select weight entries, slow and jerky UI, too many clicks to get at my data, .... This is not even alpha quality.81 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVVEVBmWxX_gWjzibg4EOPFCBPVpbfSmVF_12fh1nXgjgGBCXP2SQ=s32-rw)Ana Paula Albuquerque*more\_vert*

June 10, 2020There has been 5days that my band3 doesn't work. My sleep hasn't been updated the past nights, now my steps hasn't been uploaded too, yesterday I had almost 25k steps and on the app it shows just 400steps. I've factory reset the watch also reset the app, checked all settings but it's just not working. An entire year using it and I've lost all my data. Mercury retrograde affecting our technologies. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews
