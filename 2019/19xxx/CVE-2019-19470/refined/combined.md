Instead of describing how to work around it, I recommend you install [this](https://cloud.pados.hu/s/PAjGpLe73Wo3KZb) pre-release version.

This is true even if the program is in the exception list. (Before this update I was only checking Windows file shares, I didn't realise that was a separate problem to all these other connections - devices like security cameras, printers, routers and so on.)

I've also got a new clean Windows 10 1903 virtual machine build and it does not suffer from this problem, so there seems to be something in my other systems (both virtual machines and hosts) that causes this ... I haven't been able to work out what yet.

    > I've been trying to uninstall v2.99.10 from one machine but it keeps coming up: "There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.

The problem doesn't affect a clean Windows build so I've experimented with resetting and then disabling the Windows Firewall with no change. Now I wanted a completely clean TinyWall install - any help would be appreciated.

The controller has exited, but restarting it (or the machine) seems to have everything working as normal - but TinyWall was not removed.

The problem doesn't affect a clean Windows build so I've experimented with resetting and then disabling the Windows Firewall with no change. Now I wanted a completely clean TinyWall install - any help would be appreciated.Click to expand...

    > Not that it helped. After uninstall and resetting the Windows Firewall to defaults, I proved the network was all restoring properly after a reboot. (You start up an the file shares show red Xs but clicking on them immediately reestablishes the connection.) Then I installed v2.99.10 again and the old problems came back, this time with network shares not coming back either (red Xs but clicking on them delays and then reports failure).

    > When you cannot uninstall TinyWall, the only reason I am aware of is TinyWall.exe has been deleted/removed before running the uninstaller. This has happened recently due to false positives with Avast. If this happens in the future, I'd check if your antivirus has quarantined TinyWall.exe, and restore it. Then uninstalling should work to the best of my knowledge. No known problems at least.

    > TinyWall 2.1.13. released with a fix for CVE-2019-19470 discovered by security researchers at CODE WHITE GmbH. An attacker who has already compromised the local system could use TinyWall Controller to gain additional privileges by attaching a debugger to the running process and modifying the code in memory.
