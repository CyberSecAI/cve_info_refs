Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2019-19470:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the unsafe usage of .NET deserialization within TinyWall's Named Pipe message processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe .NET deserialization. This means that the application is deserializing data from an untrusted source without proper validation, allowing for the possibility to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain the highest level of privileges on the local machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attacker is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to have access to the local system.
- The attacker needs to attach a debugger to the running TinyWall process (TinyWall Controller) and modify the code in memory by exploiting the unsafe deserialization

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to attach a debugger to the TinyWall process.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify code in memory

**Additional Information:**
- The affected product is TinyWall, versions up to and including 2.1.12.
- The vulnerability is fixed in TinyWall version 2.1.13.
- The vulnerability was discovered by security researchers at CODE WHITE GmbH.
