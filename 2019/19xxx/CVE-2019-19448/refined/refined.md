  "CVE-2019-19448": {
    "description": "A bug was discovered in Btrfs that could lead to a use-after-free, and could be triggered by crafted filesystem images.",
    "root_cause": "The `try_merge_free_space` function in `fs/btrfs/free-space-cache.c` can have the local variables `right_info` and `left_info` pointing to the same memory address, leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A user permitted to mount and access arbitrary filesystems could use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted filesystem images"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to mount and access arbitrary filesystems"
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because `tree_search_offset` can return the same pointer for both `right_info` and `left_info`. Subsequently, `right_info` is freed, and then the freed memory is accessed via `left_info`. The issue is triggered by a crafted btrfs image during the `syncfs` syscall. The `try_merge_free_space` function attempts to merge free space regions and causes the use-after-free in the process."
