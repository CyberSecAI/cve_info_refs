- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of range checks on the `acfn_p` parameter within the `ACFN` command. This parameter is used as an array index.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds memory write due to missing range checks on user-supplied input used as an array index.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory corruption.
    - Arbitrary code execution if the memory corruption can be controlled to overwrite executable code.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted UDP network packets to port 49000 with a malformed `ACFN` command containing an out-of-bounds value for the `acfn_p` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send UDP packets to the machine running X-Plane on port 49000.
    - The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
