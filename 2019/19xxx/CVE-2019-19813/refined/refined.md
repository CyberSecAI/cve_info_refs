{
  "CVE-2019-19813": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the `mutex_can_spin_on_owner` function within the Linux kernel's btrfs filesystem.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability due to improper handling of task_struct pointers",
      "Race condition between freeing a task_struct and accessing it within mutex_can_spin_on_owner"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local user can trigger a denial of service by crashing the kernel. It may also lead to memory corruption or privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Mounting a crafted btrfs filesystem image",
      "Executing a crafted program on the mounted image",
        "Triggering the syncfs syscall after performing certain operations on the crafted image"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Local user access",
        "Ability to mount a crafted file system image",
        "Ability to execute a crafted program"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs when the `__mutex_owner(lock)` function returns a pointer to a freed `task_struct` which is then dereferenced in the `mutex_can_spin_on_owner` function while trying to access the `on_cpu` field. The issue occurs during operations within `btrfs_insert_delayed_items`, which subsequently trigger the mutex lock and the faulty code path."
