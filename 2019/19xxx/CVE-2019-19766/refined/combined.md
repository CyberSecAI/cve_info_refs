From [bitwarden/jslib#52](https://github.com/bitwarden/jslib/issues/52) :

> However, that workaround is specifically prohibited by Bitwarden, restricting it to 2M iterations. Modern SHA256 hardware can do 22,200,000,000 hashes per watt-second, so a single unit operating at 1000W can bruteforce 11,100,000 passwords per second with the maximum iteration count allowed. The default iteration count is much less, allowing for practical and efficient dictionary attacks with hardware.

# SHA256 is a terrible choice for a PBKDF in 2019.¬†#52

## Description

![@sneak](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/408977?v=4&size=48)[sneak](https://github.com/sneak)opened [on Oct 31, 2019](https://github.com/bitwarden/jslib/issues/52#issue-515480136)

<https://github.com/bitwarden/jslib/blob/cd46f64993545a1cb772e2f6a2137a675554f3c3/src/enums/kdfType.ts>

It looks like the only supported choice for a PBKDF is SHA256. This is possibly the worst choice available for a password-based KDF, as a PBKDF should be relatively slow, and SHA256 is perhaps practically the fastest hash function on earth due to optimizations made for Bitcoin (e.g. cheap ASICs and suchlike). Even iterated, it's way too fast, and only getting faster.

I was evaluating Bitwarden as a potential replacement for Dashlane (Dashlane sucks) but this is a real non-starter for me. Please up your KDF game. It's 2019.

TL;DR: Use Argon2. <https://www.npmjs.com/package/argon2>
