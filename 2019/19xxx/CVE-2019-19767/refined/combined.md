## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18811](/security/CVE-2019-18811))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19050](/security/CVE-2019-19050), [CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19077](/security/CVE-2019-19077))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

It was discovered that the IO uring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly perform credentials checks in certain situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges.

([CVE-2019-19241](/security/CVE-2019-19241))

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or have other unspecified impacts. ([CVE-2019-19252](/security/CVE-2019-19252))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel on x86

platforms when keeping track of which process was assigned control of the

FPU. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-19602](/security/CVE-2019-19602))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

It was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker

could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

                 CVE-2019-19966

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19052

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the gs_usb
    CAN driver if the open (interface-up) operation fails.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19056, CVE-2019-19057

    Navid Emamdoost discovered potential memory leaks in the mwifiex
    wifi driver if the probe operation fails.  The security impact of
    this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19062

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the AF_ALG
    subsystem if the CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG operation fails.  A local user
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

CVE-2019-19066

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the bfa SCSI
    driver if the get_fc_host_stats operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19227

    Dan Carpenter reported missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation that could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19332

    The syzkaller tool discovered a missing bounds check in the KVM
    implementation for x86, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to use KVM could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-19523

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free bug in the adutux
    USB driver.  An attacker able to add and remove USB devices could
    use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19524

    The syzkaller tool discovered a race condition in the ff-memless
    library used by input drivers.  An attacker able to add and remove
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19527

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the hiddev driver did not
    correctly handle races between a task opening the device and
    disconnection of the underlying hardware.  A local user permitted
    to access hiddev devices, and able to add and remove USB devices,
    could use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19530

    The syzkaller tool discovered a potential use-after-free in the
    cdc-acm network driver.  An attacker able to add USB devices could
    use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19531

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free bug in the yurex
    USB driver.  An attacker able to add and remove USB devices could
    use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19532

    The syzkaller tool discovered a potential heap buffer overflow in
    the hid-gaff input driver, which was also found to exist in many
    other input drivers.  An attacker able to add USB devices could
    use this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash)
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19533

If this is something that you find in the   The Syzbot run by Dmitry at Google has reported a number of these sorts of issues which I believe is fixed by:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/tytso/ext4.git/commit/?h=dev&id=4ea99936a1630f51fc3a2d61a58ec4a1c4b7d55a>  So it might be helpful if you could run your syzkaller against the dev branch of the ext4.git tree. ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=205609#c6)  Tristan Madani    2019-11-25 10:09:07 UTC  ``` Dear  Theodore,  - Looks like syzkaller bot have found the UAF too.   - The OOB write's path is different to be triggered (check the stack trace) but the root cause seems to be similar at the end  - I am running syzkaller by myself   - I will work on the dev branch of the ext4.git tree as suggested  - At this time, I think the commit "ext4: add more paranoia checking in ext4_expand_extra_isize handling" should have fixed both issues but I can verify  Thanks.  Kind regards,  Tristan ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=205609#c7)  Eric Sandeen    2020-04-08 15:05:55 UTC  ``` Tristan -  It would be hugely useful if you would provide /any/ reproducer details in these bugs.  Simply filing bugs w/ KASAN splat forces the reader to try to guess and reverse engineer your work, which is not a particularly efficient use of developer time. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=205609#c8)  Theodore Tso    2020-04-09 01:50:19 UTC  ``` Tristan hasn't updated this bug in the last 4+ months, so I propose that we close this bug.  Tristan, if you find a problems in the future, please include the C reproducer and file separate bugs for each syzkaller problem for which you have a clean reproducer.   For bonus points, please try to take Syzkaller's reproducer (which often has a lot of unnecessary crud), and streamline it to the smallest possible reliable repro case.  Many thanks!! ``` |  |

## Details

USN-4287-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18809](/security/CVE-2019-18809))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-19965](/security/CVE-2019-19965))

It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in

certain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-20096](/security/CVE-2019-20096))

Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel

when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations

before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-5108](/security/CVE-2019-5108))

It was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while

destroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-7053](/security/CVE-2020-7053))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1069-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.15.0-1069.74~14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.15.0-1069.74~14.04.1)
* [linux-image-azure](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure)
  -
  [4.15.0.1069.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-azure/4.15.0-1069.74~14.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [linux-aws-5.0](/security/cves?package=linux-aws-5.0) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-gcp](/security/cves?package=linux-gcp) - Linux kernel for Google Cloud Platform (GCP) systems
* [linux-gke-5.0](/security/cves?package=linux-gke-5.0) - Linux kernel for Google Container Engine (GKE) systems
* [linux-oracle-5.0](/security/cves?package=linux-oracle-5.0) - Linux kernel for Oracle Cloud systems

## Details

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19050](/security/CVE-2019-19050), [CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19077](/security/CVE-2019-19077))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router TUN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19079](/security/CVE-2019-19079))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or have other unspecified impacts. ([CVE-2019-19252](/security/CVE-2019-19252))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by passing 0 as input size
commit f3e4f3fc8ee9729c4b1b27a478c68b713df53c0c upstream.
The AML code implementing the WMI methods creates a variable length
field to hold the input data we pass like this:
CreateDWordField (Arg1, 0x0C, DSZI)
Local5 = DSZI /\* \HWMC.DSZI \*/
CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, (Local5 \* 0x08), DAIN)
If we pass 0 as bios\_args.datasize argument then (Local5 \* 0x08)
is 0 which results in these errors:
[ 71.973305] ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Attempt to CreateField of length zero (20190816/dsopcode-133)
[ 71.973332] ACPI Error: Aborting method \HWMC due to previous error (AE\_AML\_OPERAND\_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
[ 71.973413] ACPI Error: Aborting method \\_SB.WMID.WMAA due to previous error (AE\_AML\_OPERAND\_VALUE) (20190816/psparse-529)
And in our HPWMI\_WIRELESS2\_QUERY calls always failing. for read commands
like HPWMI\_WIRELESS2\_QUERY the DSZI value is not used / checked, except for
read commands where extra input is needed to specify exactly what to read.
So for HPWMI\_WIRELESS2\_QUERY we can safely pass the size of the expected
output as insize to hp\_wmi\_perform\_query(), as we are already doing for all
other HPWMI\_READ commands we send. Doing so fixes these errors.

platform/x86: hp-wmi: Fix ACPI errors caused by too small buffer
commit 16245db1489cd9aa579506f64afeeeb13d825a93 upstream.
The HP WMI calls may take up to 128 bytes of data as input, and
the AML methods implementing the WMI calls, declare a couple of fields for
accessing input in different sizes, specifycally the HWMC method contains:
CreateField (Arg1, 0x80, 0x0400, D128)
Even though we do not use any of the WMI command-types which need a buffer
of this size, the APCI interpreter still tries to create it as it is
declared in generoc code at the top of the HWMC method which runs before
the code looks at which command-type is requested.
This results in many of these errors on many different HP laptop models:
[ 14.459261] ACPI Error: Field [D128] at 1152 exceeds Buffer [NULL] size 160 (bits) (20170303/dsopcode-236)
[ 14.459268] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\HWMC] (Node ffff8edcc61507f8), AE\_AML\_BUFFER\_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
[ 14.459279] ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\\_SB.WMID.WMAA] (Node ffff8edcc61523c0), AE\_AML\_BUFFER\_LIMIT (20170303/psparse-543)
This commit increases the size of the data element of the bios\_args struct
to 128 bytes fixing these errors.

HID: core: check whether Usage Page item is after Usage ID items
commit 1cb0d2aee26335d0bccf29100c7bed00ebece851 upstream.
Upstream commit 58e75155009c ("HID: core: move Usage Page concatenation
to Main item") adds support for Usage Page item after Usage ID items
(such as keyboards manufactured by Primax).
Usage Page concatenation in Main item works well for following report
descriptor patterns:
USAGE\_PAGE (Keyboard) 05 07
USAGE\_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl) 19 E0
USAGE\_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI) 29 E7
LOGICAL\_MINIMUM (0) 15 00
LOGICAL\_MAXIMUM (1) 25 01
REPORT\_SIZE (1) 75 01
REPORT\_COUNT (8) 95 08
INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) 81 02
-------------
USAGE\_MINIMUM (Keyboard LeftControl) 19 E0
USAGE\_MAXIMUM (Keyboard Right GUI) 29 E7
LOGICAL\_MINIMUM (0) 15 00
LOGICAL\_MAXIMUM (1) 25 01
REPORT\_SIZE (1) 75 01
REPORT\_COUNT (8) 95 08
USAGE\_PAGE (Keyboard) 05 07
INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) 81 02
But it makes the parser act wrong for the following report
descriptor pattern(such as some Gamepads):
USAGE\_PAGE (Button) 05 09
USAGE (Button 1) 09 01
USAGE (Button 2) 09 02
USAGE (Button 4) 09 04
USAGE (Button 5) 09 05
USAGE (Button 7) 09 07
USAGE (Button 8) 09 08
USAGE (Button 14) 09 0E
USAGE (Button 15) 09 0F
USAGE (Button 13) 09 0D
USAGE\_PAGE (Consumer Devices) 05 0C
USAGE (Back) 0a 24 02
USAGE (HomePage) 0a 23 02
LOGICAL\_MINIMUM (0) 15 00
LOGICAL\_MAXIMUM (1) 25 01
REPORT\_SIZE (1) 75 01
REPORT\_COUNT (11) 95 0B
INPUT (Data,Var,Abs) 81 02
With Usage Page concatenation in Main item, parser recognizes all the
11 Usages as consumer keys, it is not the HID device's real intention.
This patch checks whether Usage Page is really defined after Usage ID
items by comparing usage page using status.
Usage Page concatenation on currently defined Usage Page will always
do in local parsing when Usage ID items encountered.
When Main item is parsing, concatenation will do again with last
defined Usage Page if this page has not been used in the previous
usages concatenation.

ext4: add more paranoia checking in ext4\_expand\_extra\_isize handling
commit 4ea99936a1630f51fc3a2d61a58ec4a1c4b7d55a upstream.
It's possible to specify a non-zero s\_want\_extra\_isize via debugging
option, and this can cause bad things(tm) to happen when using a file
system with an inode size of 128 bytes.
Add better checking when the file system is mounted, as well as when
we are actually doing the trying to do the inode expansion.

selftests: pmtu: use -oneline for ip route list cache
[ Upstream commit 2745aea6750ff0d2c48285d25bdb00e5b636ec8b ]
Some versions of iproute2 will output more than one line per entry, which
will cause the test to fail, like:
TEST: ipv6: list and flush cached exceptions [FAIL]
can't list cached exceptions
That happens, for example, with iproute2 4.15.0. When using the -oneline
option, this will work just fine:
TEST: ipv6: list and flush cached exceptions [ OK ]
This also works just fine with a more recent version of iproute2, like
5.4.0.
For some reason, two lines are printed for the IPv4 test no matter what
version of iproute2 is used. Use the same -oneline parameter there instead
of counting the lines twice.

net/tls: remove the dead inplace\_crypto code
[ Upstream commit 9e5ffed37df68d0ccfb2fdc528609e23a1e70ebe ]
Looks like when BPF support was added by commit d3b18ad31f93
("tls: add bpf support to sk\_msg handling") and
commit d829e9c4112b ("tls: convert to generic sk\_msg interface")
it broke/removed the support for in-place crypto as added by
commit 4e6d47206c32 ("tls: Add support for inplace records
encryption").
The inplace\_crypto member of struct tls\_rec is dead, inited
to zero, and sometimes set to zero again. It used to be
set to 1 when record was allocated, but the skmsg code doesn't
seem to have been written with the idea of in-place crypto
in mind.
Since non trivial effort is required to bring the feature back
and we don't really have the HW to measure the benefit just
remove the left over support for now to avoid confusing readers.

net: skmsg: fix TLS 1.3 crash with full sk\_msg
[ Upstream commit 031097d9e079e40dce401031d1012e83d80eaf01 ]
TLS 1.3 started using the entry at the end of the SG array
for chaining-in the single byte content type entry. This mostly
works:
[ E E E E E E . . ]
^ ^
start end
E < content type
/
[ E E E E E E C . ]
^ ^
start end
(Where E denotes a populated SG entry; C denotes a chaining entry.)
If the array is full, however, the end will point to the start:
[ E E E E E E E E ]
^
start
end
And we end up overwriting the start:
E < content type
/
[ C E E E E E E E ]
^
start
end
The sg array is supposed to be a circular buffer with start and
end markers pointing anywhere. In case where start > end
(i.e. the circular buffer has "wrapped") there is an extra entry
reserved at the end to chain the two halves together.
[ E E E E E E . . l ]
(Where l is the reserved entry for "looping" back to front.
As suggested by John, let's reserve another entry for chaining
SG entries after the main circular buffer. Note that this entry
has to be pointed to by the end entry so its position is not fixed.
Examples of full messages:
[ E E E E E E E E . l ]
^ ^
start end
<---------------.
[ E E . E E E E E E l ]
^ ^
end start
Now the end will always point to an unused entry, so TLS 1.3
can always use it.

It was caused by rhashtable access asoc->base.sk when sctp\_assoc\_migrate
is changing its value. However, what rhashtable wants is netns from asoc
base.sk, and for an asoc, its netns won't change once set. So we can
simply fix it by caching netns since created.

net: sched: fix `tc -s class show` no bstats on class with nolock subqueues
[ Upstream commit 14e54ab9143fa60794d13ea0a66c792a2046a8f3 ]
When a classful qdisc's child qdisc has set the flag
TCQ\_F\_CPUSTATS (pfifo\_fast for example), the child qdisc's
cpu\_bstats should be passed to gnet\_stats\_copy\_basic(),
but many classful qdisc didn't do that. As a result,
`tc -s class show dev DEV` always return 0 for bytes and
packets in this case.
Pass the child qdisc's cpu\_bstats to gnet\_stats\_copy\_basic()
to fix this issue.
The qstats also has this problem, but it has been fixed
in 5dd431b6b9 ("net: sched: introduce and use qstats read...")
and bstats still remains buggy.

net: psample: fix skb\_over\_panic
[ Upstream commit 7eb9d7675c08937cd11d32b0b40442d4d731c5ee ]
We need to calculate the skb size correctly otherwise we risk triggering
skb\_over\_panic[1]. The issue is that data\_len is added to the skb in a
nl attribute, but we don't account for its header size (nlattr 4 bytes)
and alignment. We account for it when calculating the total size in
the > PSAMPLE\_MAX\_PACKET\_SIZE comparison correctly, but not when
allocating after that. The fix is simple - use nla\_total\_size() for
data\_len when allocating.
To reproduce:
$ tc qdisc add dev eth1 clsact
$ tc filter add dev eth1 egress matchall action sample rate 1 group 1 trunc 129
$ mausezahn eth1 -b bcast -a rand -c 1 -p 129

macvlan: schedule bc\_work even if error
[ Upstream commit 1d7ea55668878bb350979c377fc72509dd6f5b21 ]
While enqueueing a broadcast skb to port->bc\_queue, schedule\_work()
is called to add port->bc\_work, which processes the skbs in
bc\_queue, to "events" work queue. If port->bc\_queue is full, the
skb will be discarded and schedule\_work(&port->bc\_work) won't be
called. However, if port->bc\_queue is full and port->bc\_work is not
running or pending, port->bc\_queue will keep full and schedule\_work()
won't be called any more, and all broadcast skbs to macvlan will be
discarded. This case can happen:
macvlan\_process\_broadcast() is the pending function of port->bc\_work,
it moves all the skbs in port->bc\_queue to the queue "list", and
processes the skbs in "list". During this, new skbs will keep being
added to port->bc\_queue in macvlan\_broadcast\_enqueue(), and
port->bc\_queue may already full when macvlan\_process\_broadcast()
return. This may happen, especially when there are a lot of real-time
threads and the process is preempted.
Fix this by calling schedule\_work(&port->bc\_work) even if
port->bc\_work is full in macvlan\_broadcast\_enqueue().

x86/fpu: Don't cache access to fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx
commit 59c4bd853abcea95eccc167a7d7fd5f1a5f47b98 upstream.
The state/owner of the FPU is saved to fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx by pointing
to the context that is currently loaded. It never changed during the
lifetime of a task - it remained stable/constant.
After deferred FPU registers loading until return to userland was
implemented, the content of fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx may change during
preemption and must not be cached.
This went unnoticed for some time and was now noticed, in particular
since gcc 9 is caching that load in copy\_fpstate\_to\_sigframe() and
reusing it in the retry loop:
copy\_fpstate\_to\_sigframe()
load fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx and save on stack
fpregs\_lock()
copy\_fpregs\_to\_sigframe() /\* failed \*/
fpregs\_unlock()
\*\*\* PREEMPTION, another uses FPU, changes fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx \*\*\*
fault\_in\_pages\_writeable() /\* succeed, retry \*/

Use this\_cpu\_read() instead this\_cpu\_read\_stable() to avoid caching of
fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx during preemption points.
The Fixes: tag points to the commit where deferred FPU loading was
added. Since this commit, the compiler is no longer allowed to move the
load of fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx somewhere else / outside of the locked
section. A task preemption will change its value and stale content will
be observed.

thunderbolt: Power cycle the router if NVM authentication fails
commit 7a7ebfa85f4fac349f3ab219538c44efe18b0cf6 upstream.
On zang's Dell XPS 13 9370 after Thunderbolt NVM firmware upgrade the
Thunderbolt controller did not come back as expected. Only after the
system was rebooted it became available again. It is not entirely clear
what happened but I suspect the new NVM firmware image authentication
failed for some reason. Regardless of this the router needs to be power
cycled if NVM authentication fails in order to get it fully functional
again.
This modifies the driver to issue a power cycle in case the NVM
authentication fails immediately when dma\_port\_flash\_update\_auth()
returns. We also need to call tb\_switch\_set\_uuid() earlier to be able to
fetch possible NVM authentication failure when DMA port is added.

Testing on different generations of Lantiq MIPS SoC based boards, showed
that it takes up to 1500 us until the core reset bit is cleared.
The driver from the vendor SDK (ifxhcd) uses a 1 second timeout. Use the
same timeout to fix wrong hang detections and make the driver work for
Lantiq MIPS SoCs.
At least till kernel 4.14 the hanging reset only caused a warning but
the driver was probed successful. With kernel 4.19 errors out with
EBUSY.

platform\_find\_device\_by\_driver calls bus\_find\_device and passes

mismatching type trips indirect call Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) checking.
This change adds a callback function with the correct type and instead
of casting the function, explicitly casts the second parameter to struct

crypto: inside-secure - Fix stability issue with Macchiatobin
commit b8c5d882c8334d05754b69dcdf1cfd6bc48a9e12 upstream.
This patch corrects an error in the Transform Record Cache initialization
code that was causing intermittent stability problems on the Macchiatobin
board.
Unfortunately, due to HW platform specifics, the problem could not happen
on the main development platform, being the VCU118 Xilinx development
board. And since it was a problem with hash table access, it was very
dependent on the actual physical context record DMA buffers being used,
i.e. with some (bad) luck it could seemingly work quit stable for a while.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

ext4: add more paranoia checking in ext4\_expand\_extra\_isize handling

```
It's possible to specify a non-zero s_want_extra_isize via debugging
option, and this can cause bad things(tm) to happen when using a file
system with an inode size of 128 bytes.

Add better checking when the file system is mounted, as well as when
we are actually doing the trying to do the inode expansion.

An update that solves 35 vulnerabilities and has 194 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-14615: Insufficient control flow in certain data structures for
some Intel(R) Processors with Intel(R) Processor Graphics may have
allowed an unauthenticated user to potentially enable information
disclosure via local access (bnc#1160195 bnc#1165881).
- CVE-2019-14896: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in
the Marvell WiFi chip driver. A remote attacker could cause a denial of
service (system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when the
lbs\_ibss\_join\_existing function is called after a STA connects to an AP
(bnc#1157157).
- CVE-2019-14897: A stack-based buffer overflow was found in the Marvell
WiFi chip driver. An attacker is able to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or, possibly execute arbitrary code, when a STA works in
IBSS mode (allows connecting stations together without the use of an AP)
and connects to another STA (bnc#1157155).
- CVE-2019-16746: An issue was discovered in net/wireless/nl80211.c. It
did not check the length of variable elements in a beacon head, leading
to a buffer overflow (bnc#1152107).
- CVE-2019-16994: In the Linux kernel before 5.0, a memory leak exists in
sit\_init\_net() in net/ipv6/sit.c when register\_netdev() fails to
register sitn->fb\_tunnel\_dev, which may cause denial of service, aka
CID-07f12b26e21a (bnc#1161523).
- CVE-2019-18808: A memory leak in the ccp\_run\_sha\_cmd() function in
drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption), aka CID-128c66429247 (bnc#1156259).
- CVE-2019-19036: btrfs\_root\_node in fs/btrfs/ctree.c allowed a NULL
pointer dereference because rcu\_dereference(root->node) can be zero
(bnc#1157692).
- CVE-2019-19045: A memory leak in the mlx5\_fpga\_conn\_create\_cq() function
in drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/fpga/conn.c allowed attackers
to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering
mlx5\_vector2eqn() failures, aka CID-c8c2a057fdc7 (bnc#1161522).
- CVE-2019-19051: A memory leak in the i2400m\_op\_rfkill\_sw\_toggle()
function in drivers/net/wimax/i2400m/op-rfkill.c allowed attackers to
cause a denial of service (memory consumption), aka CID-6f3ef5c25cc7
(bnc#1159024).
- CVE-2019-19054: A memory leak in the cx23888\_ir\_probe() function in

denial of service (memory consumption) by triggering kfifo\_alloc()
failures, aka CID-a7b2df76b42b (bnc#1161518).
- CVE-2019-19066: A memory leak in the bfad\_im\_get\_stats() function in
drivers/scsi/bfa/bfad\_attr.c allowed attackers to cause a denial of
service (memory consumption) by triggering bfa\_port\_get\_stats()
failures, aka CID-0e62395da2bd (bnc#1157303).
- CVE-2019-19318: Mounting a crafted btrfs image twice can cause an
rwsem\_down\_write\_slowpath use-after-free because (in
rwsem\_can\_spin\_on\_owner in kernel/locking/rwsem (bnc#1158026).
- CVE-2019-19319: A setxattr operation, after a mount of a crafted ext4
image, can cause a slab-out-of-bounds write access because of an
ext4\_xattr\_set\_entry use-after-free in fs/ext4/xattr.c when a large
old\_size value is used in a memset call (bnc#1158021).
- CVE-2019-19332: An out-of-bounds memory write issue was found in the way
the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled the 'KVM\_GET\_EMULATED\_CPUID'
ioctl(2) request to get CPUID features emulated by the KVM hypervisor. A
user or process able to access the '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw
to crash the system, resulting in a denial of service (bnc#1158827).
- CVE-2019-19338: There was an incomplete fix for Transaction Asynchronous
Abort (TAA) (bnc#1158954).
- CVE-2019-19447: Mounting a crafted ext4 filesystem image, performing
some operations, and unmounting can lead to a use-after-free in
ext4\_put\_super in fs/ext4/super.c, related to dump\_orphan\_list in
fs/ext4/super.c (bnc#1158819).
- CVE-2019-19526: There was a use-after-free bug that can be caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/nfc/pn533/usb.c driver, aka
CID-6af3aa57a098 (bnc#1158893).
- CVE-2019-19527: There was a use-after-free bug that can be caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/hid/usbhid/hiddev.c driver, aka
CID-9c09b214f30e (bnc#1158900).
- CVE-2019-19532: There were multiple out-of-bounds write bugs that can be
caused by a malicious USB device in the Linux kernel HID drivers, aka
CID-d9d4b1e46d95. This affects drivers/hid/hid-axff.c,
drivers/hid/hid-dr.c, drivers/hid/hid-emsff.c, drivers/hid/hid-gaff.c,
drivers/hid/hid-holtekff.c, drivers/hid/hid-lg2ff.c,
drivers/hid/hid-lg3ff.c, drivers/hid/hid-lg4ff.c,
drivers/hid/hid-lgff.c, drivers/hid/hid-logitech-hidpp.c,
drivers/hid/hid-microsoft.c, drivers/hid/hid-sony.c,
drivers/hid/hid-tmff.c, and drivers/hid/hid-zpff.c (bnc#1158824).

ext4: add more paranoia checking in ext4\_expand\_extra\_isize handlingIt's possible to specify a non-zero s\_want\_extra\_isize via debugging
option, and this can cause bad things(tm) to happen when using a file
system with an inode size of 128 bytes.
Add better checking when the file system is mounted, as well as when
we are actually doing the trying to do the inode expansion.

Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005
    media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19037

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not
    correctly handle directories with holes (unallocated regions) in
    them.  An attacker able to mount arbitrary ext4 volumes could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19052

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the gs_usb
    CAN driver if the open (interface-up) operation fails.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19056, CVE-2019-19057

    wifi driver if the probe operation fails.  The security impact of
    this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19062

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the AF_ALG
    subsystem if the CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG operation fails.  A local user
    could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    exhaustion).

CVE-2019-19066

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the bfa SCSI
    driver if the get_fc_host_stats operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19068

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the rtl8xxxu
    wifi driver, in case it fails to submit an interrupt buffer to the
    device.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19227

    Dan Carpenter reported missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation that could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19332

    The syzkaller tool discovered a missing bounds check in the KVM
    implementation for x86, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to use KVM could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
    handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
    already has a link count of 0.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19523

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free bug in the adutux
    USB driver.  An attacker able to add and remove USB devices could
