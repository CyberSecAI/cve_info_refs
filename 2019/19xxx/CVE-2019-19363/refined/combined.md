# CVE-2019-19363 - Local Privilege Escalation in many Ricoh Printer Drivers for Windows

Local Privilege Escalation in many Ricoh Printer Drivers for Windows
(CVE-2019-19363)
======================================================================

Summary
--------

Pentagrid has been asked to  manage the coordinated disclosure process
for a vulnerability that affects several Windows printer drivers for a
wide  range of  printers  by  the printer  manufacture  Ricoh. Due  to
improperly  set  file permissions  of  file  system entries  that  are
installed when a printer is added  to a Windows system, any local user
is able to overwrite program library files (DLLs) with own code.

Impact
-------

The improperly  protected library  files are  loaded by  the Windows
PrintIsolationHost.exe,  which  is  a privileged  process  running  as
SYSTEM. When an attacker overwrites library  files that are used in an
administrative   context,  the   library  code   gets  executed   with
administrative  privileges as  well.  Thus, the  attacker  is able  to
escalate privileges to SYSTEM.

As installing printer  drivers is not disallowed by  default on Domain
managed Windows computers,  this can be used as  a universal privilege
escalation as  long as  the vulnerable printer  drivers are  valid and
installable.

CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, 8.8 High

Timeline
---------

* 2019-10-17: Pentagrid has been asked to support the disclosure
              process, because the source was not successful in
              reporting this vulnerability to Ricoh.
* 2019-10-23: Asked @ricoheurope Twitter channel regarding a security
              contact. No response, yet.
* 2019-10-29: Successfully established a contact with a Ricoh employee
              via LinkedIn. Other contact attempts via LinkedIn failed
              so far.

Affected Components
--------------------

Printer  drivers  for  Ricoh,  Savin and  Lanier  printer  brands  are
affected.  The  following drivers  for  Windows  10  are known  to  be
affected:

* SP 8300DN - PCL6 Driver for Universal Print, Ver.4.23.0.0,
  release date 10/08/2019:
<http://support.ricoh.com/bb/pub_e/dr_ut_e/0001315/0001315878/V42300/z87179L19.exe>

  3ef2a1dc09e2dde71ed9db9f6c629ff0140d172fbe71c9e376d391e3162090f0)

Especially the Universal Print driver supports a wide range of printer
models. Furthermore, printers are also  marketed under the brand names
Savin and Lanier, which use  the same drivers.  Additional drivers and
driver versions are affected as well.  Ricoh's advisory lists affected
drivers and versions.

Technical Details
------------------

To reproduce  the vulnerability,  download an affected  printer driver
such  as  the  PCL6  Driver for  Universal  Print,  Version  4.23.0.0,
self-extract the executable file and install the driver.

In a standard Windows installation, adding  a printer does not need an
administrator account. Instead, the  printer driver could be installed
by adding a printer and selecting an installation media.

During  the  printer  setup,  the  process  of  PrintIsolationHost.exe
creates  a directory  c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\  and installs  several
files in this  location, including several DLL files.   Every user has
full control over the installed DLL files as show below, because these
files are writable:

C:\>icacls "c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\*.dll"
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\borderline.dll Everyone:(I)(F)
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\headerfooter.dll Everyone:(I)(F)
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\jobhook.dll Everyone:(I)(F)
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\overlaywatermark.dll Everyone:(I)(F)
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\popup.dll Everyone:(I)(F)
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV\RICOH PCL6 UniversalDriver
V4.23\_common\dlz\watermark.dll Everyone:(I)(F)

Successfully processed 6 files; Failed processing 0 files

The flag  F means  full access  and the flag  I means  permissions are
inherited  from  the parent  directory.  The  inherited writable  flag
origins  from  a  parent  directory. In  fact,  the  entire  directory
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV grants full control to everyone:

C:\>icacls "c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV"
c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV Everyone:(OI)(CI)(F)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files

Here OI means Object Inherit, CI  Container Inherit, and F full access
as above.

The printer  isolation feature  has been introduced  in Windows  7 and
Windows  Server 2008  to  not have  the printer  drivers  in the  same
process as the  spooler. The isolation should add  stability for other
user's print jobs.

Exploitation
-------------

When a  DLL file from  the c:\ProgramData\RICOH_DRV is  overwritten in
the  right  moment by  a  local  attacker, the  PrintIsolationHost.exe
process  loads  the  attacker-provided  DLL   file
 below.  Afterward, the  library  code  gets executed  with
SYSTEM  privileges,  because  the PrintIsolationHost.exe  uses  SYSTEM
privileges.  This attack  idea  has  been implemented  in  a proof  of
concept exploit that is given in a later section of this advisory.

Precondition
-------------

To exploit  the vulnerability, an  attacker needs access to  a Windows
host as a regular  user and must be able to  install an affected Ricoh
printer driver as  well as to add printers, which  is usually possible
without administrative access.

Patches and Workaround
-----------------------

Please  refer  to  Ricoh's   advisory  for  mitigations  and  security
patches. Pentagrid has not reviewed them, yet.

Windows  Group  policies  are  a  potential  workaround.   When  group
policies  are used,  there is  a  group policy  to control  installing
printer  drivers  (Windows  Settings  -> Security  Settings  ->  Local
Policies -> Security Options -> Devices: Prevent Users From Installing
Printer Drivers) and  another group policy to  control adding printers
(User Configuration  -> Administrative  Templates -> Control  Panel ->
Printers ->  Prevent addition of  printers). When used,  people cannot
install drivers, respectively adding printers.

Credits
--------

This  vulnerability has  been  found by  Alexander  Pudwill, who  also
provided  an initial  proof of  concept  exploit in  C#. Pentagrid  AG
independently  validated the  findings,  fully  automated the  exploit
process and handled the coordinated disclosure.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
