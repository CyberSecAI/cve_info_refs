Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-3c93790abe
2020-01-24 17:07:54.394539
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : opensc
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 0.20.0
Release : 3.fc31
URL : <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
Summary : Smart card library and applications
Description :
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too.

Subject: OpenSC 0.20.0 released

Hi all!

I'm happy to finally announce the new release 0.20.0 of OpenSC. You can
read a full summary of the changes and get the release binaries on GitHub
<<https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.20.0>>.

We've extended our continuous testing by fuzzing the code with OSS-Fuzz
<<https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz>>. It is running billions of tests each
weak and has found around 100 unique crashes, most notable the security
issues tracked as CVE-2019-6502, CVE-2019-15946, CVE-2019-15945,
CVE-2019-19480, CVE-2019-19481 and CVE-2019-19479. Getting our hands on all
the problems reported by the fuzzing was very challenging. Special thanks
to Jakub Jelen, who spend many hours on analyzing and fixing many of the
issues.

Regards,
Frank Morgner.
