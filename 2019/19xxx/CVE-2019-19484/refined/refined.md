The provided content discusses CVE-2019-19484, along with CVE-2019-19486 and CVE-2019-19487, which are vulnerabilities found in Centreon 19.04. The specific vulnerability discussed in this article relates to an open redirect issue, where a parameter 'p' is not properly handled during login, leading to a redirect to an attacker-controlled URL after successful authentication.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `p` parameter in the `login.php` script of Centreon. Specifically, this parameter is not sanitized and is reflected in the URL after successful login.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect. The application redirects users to a URL specified by the unsanitized `p` parameter.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** By crafting a malicious link containing a specially crafted `p` parameter, an attacker could redirect a user to an arbitrary URL after they log in. This could be used for phishing attacks, credential harvesting or other malicious activities, as the user is likely to trust the legitimate login process.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is a crafted URL with a malicious `p` parameter. An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking this link, which could be done through social engineering or other means.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send the crafted URL to a victim who has an account on the affected Centreon instance, using social engineering or a similar method.
