{
  "CVE-2019-19924": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "SQLite incorrectly handled parser tree rewriting.",
    "details": "The vulnerability is caused by incorrect error handling in the `sqlite3WindowRewrite()` function. When an error occurs during the parser tree rewriting process for window functions, the code fails to properly set the `pParse->nErr` flag. This omission prevents the system from shutting down subsequent code generation, which relies on the implemented transformations. This could lead to a crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue was discovered by the Yongheng and Rui fuzzer.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "SQLite 3.30.1",
      "Ubuntu 19.10",
      "NetApp Cloud Backup (formerly AltaVault)",
      "SINEC INS versions < V1.0.1.1"
    ],
    "vulnerability": {
      "root_cause": "Incorrect error handling in `sqlite3WindowRewrite()` during parser tree rewriting.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755)"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of Service (crash), possibly arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Crafted SQL queries using window functions.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send specific SQL queries to trigger the vulnerability. No special user privileges are needed."
    },
    "remediation": [
      "Upgrade to a patched version of SQLite (e.g. > 3.30.1)",
      "Upgrade to libsqlite3-0 3.29.0-2ubuntu0.2 or later on Ubuntu 19.10",
      "Upgrade SINEC INS to V1.0.1.1 or later."
