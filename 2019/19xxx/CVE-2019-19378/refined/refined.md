{
  "vulnerability": {
    "overview": "The vulnerability is a slab-out-of-bounds write in the `index_rbio_pages` function of the Linux Kernel btrfs file system, triggered when mounting a crafted image. This can occur both locally (mounting a btrfs image) and remotely (mounting a corrupted storage device with a crafted btrfs image).",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the incorrect calculation of the `page_index` variable in the `index_rbio_pages` function, specifically in `fs/btrfs/raid56.c:1163`, leading to an out-of-bounds write to the `rbio->bio_pages` array.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "slab-out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to a slab-out-of-bounds write, potentially causing a denial of service or allowing for arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Mounting a crafted btrfs image locally or remotely"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to mount a crafted btrfs image, either locally on the machine, or via a storage device (USB or other storage). This generally requires some level of system access or ability to supply the crafted image as a storage device.",
