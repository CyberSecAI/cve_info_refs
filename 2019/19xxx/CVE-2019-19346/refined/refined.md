Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `openshift/mariadb-apb` container modifying the permissions of `/etc/passwd`, making it writable by users other than root. This allows a user with access to the container to modify the file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The core issue is that the `/etc/passwd` file, which should only be modifiable by the root user, is given permissions that allow other users to write to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with access to the container can modify `/etc/passwd` to add a new user with elevated privileges (e.g., a user with `uid 0`). This would allow them to gain root-level access to the container.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Container Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining access to a running instance of the vulnerable container, `openshift/mariadb-apb`. This could be achieved through various means depending on the environment, but the attacker must have some level of shell access to the container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Shell access to the vulnerable container:** The attacker needs to have some level of access to the container's shell environment to be able to modify the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   The attacker must be able to execute commands inside the container to modify the `/etc/passwd` file and create a user with UID 0.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is not directly exploitable in unprivileged containers due to the default seccomp policy blocking the `SETUID` and `SETGID` system calls.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in multiple versions of the `openshift-enterprise-mariadb-apb` package: 4.3.5-202003020549, 4.2.21-202002240343, 4.1.37-202003021622, and 3.11.188-4.
*   Red Hat issued errata notices (RHSA-2020:0617, RHSA-2020:0681, RHSA-2020:0694, and RHSA-2020:0802) addressing this vulnerability.

The provided information gives more detail than the official CVE description, as it explains the specifics of how the file permissions are changed and how an attacker could leverage it for privilege escalation.
