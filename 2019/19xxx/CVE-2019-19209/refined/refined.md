{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient filtering of the HTTP Header 'Accept-Language'. The unfiltered, but modified, variable '$langs->defaultlang' is used in multiple locations.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected XSS",
      "SQL injection"
    ],
    "impact": "XSS allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution within the context of the user's browser session. SQL injection could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or modification, although no data exfiltration was found possible due to preprocessing of the value.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests with a malicious 'Accept-Language' header.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Dolibarr application. No specific user privileges are required to exploit the vulnerabilities."
