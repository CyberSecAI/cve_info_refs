Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-19902 vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient checks on uploaded site configuration archives. The system doesn't adequately validate the data within uploaded archives, potentially allowing the upload of non-configuration scripts.
*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution and Information Disclosure
*   **Impact:** An attacker could upload malicious scripts disguised as configuration data, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a crafted site configuration archive through the user interface or command-line.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Requires the "Synchronize, import, and export configuration" permission. This permission should only be granted to trusted administrators.
    *   The server must have another server-side scripting language accessible (besides PHP, which is protected against) for the malicious code to be executed.
*   **Affected Versions:** Backdrop Core 1.14.x versions prior to 1.14.2 and Backdrop Core 1.13.x versions prior to 1.13.5.
