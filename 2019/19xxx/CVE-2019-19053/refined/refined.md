Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19053:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is a memory leak in the RPMSG (Remote Processor Messaging) character device interface within the Linux kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when `copy_from_iter_full` fails in the `rpmsg_eptdev_write_iter` function. If this function fails to copy data to a buffer, the allocated memory for the buffer is not released.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (DoS) by exhausting kernel memory, potentially leading to system instability or failure.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required. An attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the RPMSG character device interface to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a local user account on the target system to interact with the RPMSG character device.
- No specific privileges are required, just the ability to interact with the device.
- The attacker can trigger the memory leak by causing the `copy_from_iter_full` function to fail during the write operation.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented by releasing the allocated buffer if `copy_from_iter_full` failed.
- The provided GitHub commit `bbe692e349e2a1edf3fe0a29a0e05899c9c94d51` shows the code change that fixes this vulnerability.
- The fix adds a `goto free_kbuf` statement that will release allocated memory in case of a failure from `copy_from_iter_full`
- The vulnerability is present in multiple NetApp products, as well as Ubuntu.
