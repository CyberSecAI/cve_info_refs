DAP-1860 :: HW Rev. Ax :: FW v1.04b01 and below (older) :: Unauthenticated Command Bypass & Command Injection

**Overview**

On September 30, 2019, D-Link becamea aware of a 3rd Party security researcher that accused the DAP-1860 Hardware Rev. Ax of a command injection security flaw that may lead To unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) security vulnerability.  The devices is deployed LAN-side or in-home and does not require internet services, this does reduce some risk since a malicious user or attack whould have to be with-in physical proximity and be able to connect to the DAP-1860 WiFi signal that has WIFi encryption on as default.

As D-Link investigated, and validated the report, and in coordination with the 3rd Party we have release the following Beta Hot-Fix. We recommend always to keep up-to-date firmware which can be found  at [https://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DAP-1860](https://support.dlink.com/ProductInfo.aspx?m=DIR-850L)

The Beta Hot-Fix has been throught the required cyber-security testing and software quality assurance for the specific issue.  This releases has not been through a complete cycle, nor will it be released as a fully qualified software release.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures. Please check the D-Link website for updates regularly.

**3rd Party Report:**

# D-Link DAP-1860 Vulnerability

**Source**: [chung96vn’s blog](https://chung96vn.wordpress.com/2019/11/15/d-link-dap-1860-vulnerabilities/) (blog of our member)

**Introduction**

In september 2019, i found 2 vulnerabilities on D-Link Access Point (DAP-1860), there are *command injection lead to unauthenticated remote code execution and authentication bypass.* There are critical vulnerabilities because i can attack successfully without authentication. If your access point have been bought from D-Link and it’s DAP-1860, please update firmware or contact to vendor for assistance because the vulnerability i found exist on latest version firmware of DAP-1860.

Below is Web Admin Interface of DAP-1860:

# Vulnerability Details

# [CVE 2019–19597](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19597)

## Discoverer: chung96vn, VinCSS (Member of Vingroup)

## Title: Command injection lead to unauthentication remote code execution (RCE).

When i tried to understand how authenticate on Web Admin of DAP-1860, i found an issue in uhttpd server of this device when user sends HNAP request. When user sends HNAP request, if it require authentication, uhttpd server will check value of HNAP\_AUTH header. Below is code used to verify HNAP\_AUTH.

![]()

Look into code from line 243 to 246 i will find an issue, it is command injection. User can control value of HNAP\_TIME to inject command. Below is my request to run command on device.

![]()

Remember that if you want to perform request without authentication, you must bypass some conditions. In this post i can’t provide it because it is dangerous with customer of D-Link.

# [CVE 2019–19598](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19598)

## Discoverer: chung96vn, VinCSS (Member of Vingroup)

## Title: Authentication Bypass

After report vulnerability above for vendor, i also found other vulnerability on DAP-1860. When user sends HNAP request, server will split HNAP\_AUTH header into 2 part are hnap\_code and hnap\_timestamp. Hnap\_timestamp value is verified with value was stored in /var/hnap/timestamp file (current\_timestamp)**.** After that, hnap\_timestamp value is stored in /var/hnap/timestamp. Look into below image, if hnap\_timestamp <= current\_timestamp and hnap\_timestamp >= current\_timestamp — 9 value of local\_3c variable is set to 0.

![]()

Look into line 241 in below image, if variable local\_3c != 1, we can pass HNAP\_AUTH verify function. Through that, i can bypass authentication and access all HNAP api.

![]()

Finally, to bypass authentication, first i must send request to overwrite current\_timestamp of server, after that i make request with hnap\_timestamp equal current\_timestamp of server, this requests will access all HNAP api without credential.

After report vulnerability above for vendor, i also found other vulnerability on DAP-1860. When user sends HNAP request, server will split HNAP\_AUTH header into 2 part are hnap\_code and hnap\_timestamp. Hnap\_timestamp value is verified with value was stored in /var/hnap/timestamp file (current\_timestamp)**.** After that, hnap\_timestamp value is stored in /var/hnap/timestamp.
