Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19078:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability is a memory leak in the `ath10k_usb_hif_tx_sg()` function, located in `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/usb.c`. This leak occurs when the `usb_submit_urb()` function fails during the transmission of data using the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver. The allocated urb is not released when the usb submission fails.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a memory leak. Specifically, when `usb_submit_urb` fails, the allocated URB (USB Request Block) is not deallocated, leading to a progressive consumption of memory over time. This is a resource exhaustion issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability will lead to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion. This happens by repeatedly triggering `usb_submit_urb()` failures, resulting in the accumulation of unreleased URB objects, and eventually leading to kernel memory exhaustion and system instability or crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves triggering the `usb_submit_urb()` function to fail. This can potentially be achieved by:
-   **Network:** By performing a large number of operations or sending malformed packets to the wireless interface. (As shown in the SUSE analysis)
-   **Physical:**  By physically disrupting or manipulating the USB device. (As indicated by SUSE's CVSS vector)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
To exploit this vulnerability:
-   The attacker needs to be able to interact with the wireless interface in some manner.
-   An attacker needs a way to make `usb_submit_urb()` fail, This can be achieved by injecting malformed packets into the wireless interface or by physically manipulating the USB device.
-   In the case of local exploitation, a local attacker needs a system where the vulnerable kernel module is loaded, and they have local access. 

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves adding a release (free) for the allocated URB when submission fails.
*   Some vendors like SUSE mention that due to the nature of this bug class they "won't fix" all such CVEs in their kernel, which indicates the memory leak is likely caused by incomplete error handling.
*   The Suse advisory states  "This issue is currently rated as having **moderate** severity.", despite the CVSS score being lower and marked as low severity.
*   Fedora's advisory mentions this vulnerability leads to DoS
*  Ubuntu states that this is a local DoS
