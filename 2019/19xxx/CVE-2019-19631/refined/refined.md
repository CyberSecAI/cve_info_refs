The provided content is related to CVE-2019-19631.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Big Monitoring Fabric application's `/api/v1/export` endpoint was vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure, as it returned SSH RSA private keys and valid user session cookies, including those for administrative users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive information disclosure: The `/api/v1/export` endpoint exposed sensitive data (SSH private keys and session cookies).
- Privilege escalation: A low-privilege read-only user could use an admin session cookie to escalate privileges to an administrative account.
- Insecure password change: The application allowed changing the 'Default admin' password without requiring knowledge of the original password.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of sensitive data: An attacker could obtain SSH private keys and valid session cookies.
- Privilege escalation: A low-privilege user could escalate to an administrative account.
- Remote code execution: An attacker could gain SSH console access due to the ability to reset the admin password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- API endpoint: The `/api/v1/export` endpoint was the entry point for the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the application's API: An attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (read-only or admin) to exploit the sensitive information disclosure vulnerability.
