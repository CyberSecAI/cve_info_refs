Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is that the `openshift/jenkins-slave-base-rhel7-container` container image incorrectly modifies the permissions of the `/etc/passwd` file, making it writable by users other than root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the setting of insecure permissions on `/etc/passwd` within the affected container. Normally, only root should be able to modify this file.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The writable `/etc/passwd` allows for privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker with access to the running container can exploit this vulnerability to:
- Modify `/etc/passwd` to add a new user with elevated privileges (e.g., a user with UID 0).
- Gain root access to the container, leading to complete compromise of the container.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Container Access:** The attacker needs to gain access to a running container based on the vulnerable `openshift/jenkins-slave-base-rhel7-container` image. This can be achieved through various means such as compromised application code, or exploiting an application running within the container.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Container:** The attacker must have some level of access to a running container instance of the vulnerable image. This access doesn't need to be root at the start, but it must be sufficient to write to the `/etc/passwd` file.
- **Basic Linux knowledge:** To add a new user with a shell, the attacker needs basic understanding of the format of the `/etc/passwd` file and how to create a new entry.

**Additional Notes:**
-  By default, this vulnerability is not exploitable in unprivileged containers running on OpenShift Container Platform because the `SETUID` and `SETGID` system calls are blocked by the default seccomp policy.
-  The vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform versions 4.3, 4.2, and 3.11 via errata RHSA-2020:0562, RHSA-2020:0526, and RHSA-2020:0803, respectively.
