Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a memory leak in the `nl80211_get_ftm_responder_stats()` function within the Linux kernel's `net/wireless/nl80211.c` file. The function allocates a new sk_buff using `nlmsg_new`. If `nl80211hdr_put()` subsequently fails, the allocated `msg` (sk_buff) is not properly released, leading to a memory leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory Leak: Failure to free allocated memory when `nl80211hdr_put()` fails.
- Resource Exhaustion: Repeatedly triggering the vulnerable code path leads to memory consumption and a potential denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Attackers can cause the system to crash by exhausting kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the netlink-based 802.11 configuration interface. Specifically, triggering a failure in `nl80211hdr_put()` within `nl80211_get_ftm_responder_stats()`.
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the nl80211 interface and cause `nl80211hdr_put()` to fail. This usually requires a local user or someone with network access capable of configuring the wireless interface.
- It's not clear from the provided information exactly how `nl80211hdr_put()` would fail, but it involves the skb not having enough space for the header to be added.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local Access or Network Access: An attacker would need either local access to the system or network access capable of manipulating the wireless interface to trigger the vulnerable code path.
- Ability to trigger the specific code path: The attacker needs the ability to cause the `nl80211hdr_put()` function to fail within the `nl80211_get_ftm_responder_stats()` function.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" by Red Hat due to the preconditions needed to trigger the resource cleanup code path.
- A mitigation is suggested in Red Hat Bugzilla which involves blacklisting the `cfg80211` kernel module to prevent the vulnerable code from loading.
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux via errata RHSA-2020:4060 and RHSA-2020:4062.
- The upstream commit that fixes the issue is: `https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1399c59fa92984836db90538cf92397fe7caaa57`
- The fix involves changing the return statement to a `goto` to the error handling code to free the allocated `msg`.

In summary, CVE-2019-19055 is a memory leak vulnerability that allows an attacker to cause a DoS by triggering a specific error path when querying Fine Timing Measurement (FTM) responder statistics in the Linux kernel's nl80211 interface.
