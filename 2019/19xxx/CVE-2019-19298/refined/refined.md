- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The streaming service of the SiNVR/SiVMS Video Server has an input validation vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation in the streaming service.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending malformed HTTP requests to the streaming service (default port 5410/tcp).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be unauthenticated and remote, they need network access to the vulnerable service.
