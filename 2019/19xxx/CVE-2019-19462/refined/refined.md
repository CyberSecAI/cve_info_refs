  "CVE-2019-19462": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.7. The prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067. An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.4.7. The prb_calc_retire_blk_tmo() function in net/packet/af_packet.c can result in a denial of service (CPU consumption and soft lockup) in a certain failure case involving TPACKET_V3, aka CID-b43d1f9f7067. relay_open in kernel/relay.c in the Linux kernel through 5.4.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (such as relay blockage) by triggering a NULL alloc_percpu result. It was discovered that the kernel->user space relay implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly check return values in some situations. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).",

Also, missing error check in the 'relay' library used to implement various files under debugfs.  A local user permitted to access debugfs could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

    "Description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's SELinux subsystem in versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while importing the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's category bitmap into the SELinux extensible bitmap via the' ebitmap\_netlbl\_import' routine. While processing the CIPSO restricted bitmap tag in the 'cipso\_v4\_parsetag\_rbm' routine, it sets the security attribute to indicate that the category bitmap is present, even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads to a NULL pointer dereference issue while importing the same category bitmap into SELinux.
