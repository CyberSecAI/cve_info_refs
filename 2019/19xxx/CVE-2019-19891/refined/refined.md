Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** An encryption key vulnerability exists in Mitel SIP-DECT phones.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a flaw in the encryption key management of Mitel SIP-DECT phones. This can allow an attacker to potentially decrypt communication between Mitel SIP-DECT devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful attack could enable an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack. This would allow them to intercept and potentially eavesdrop on sensitive information transmitted through the vulnerable SIP-DECT phone system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is described as man-in-the-middle.
- The attacker needs to have already compromised the internal wired corporate network, which is a prerequisite for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a primary compromise of the internal wired corporate network to position themselves for a man-in-the-middle attack.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept the communication between the SIP-DECT phone and its base station.

**Affected Products:**
- Mitel SIP-DECT phones with firmware versions 8.1 and 8.0.
