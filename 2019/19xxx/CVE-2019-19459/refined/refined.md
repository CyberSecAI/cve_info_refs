Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19459:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the "Data Export" functionality of the SALTO ProAccess SPACE software. This allows an attacker to manipulate the export file name to traverse outside the designated export path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Path Traversal:** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate the file system beyond the intended directory.
- **Arbitrary File Write:** By exploiting the path traversal, an attacker can write arbitrary content to arbitrary locations on the server. This is further exacerbated because of the SYSTEM privilege that the webserver runs under.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By writing files to auto-start locations or other executable locations, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the Windows server.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Since the web server runs with SYSTEM privileges, an attacker can effectively gain complete control of the server.
- **Data Manipulation and Loss:** The ability to write arbitrary files can lead to data corruption, modification, and loss.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through the web application's "Data Export" feature, where the user can specify a filename.
- The attacker must be authenticated to access the export functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must have a valid user account on the SALTO ProAccess SPACE system to be able to access the "Data Export" feature.
- The attacker needs to craft malicious filenames with path traversal sequences like `..\` to navigate outside of the application's root directory and to point to a desired directory on the server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in SALTO ProAccess SPACE versions <= v5.5 and is fixed in v5.6.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by combining the path traversal with the data export function, by adding the desired payload into a field such as Username, or notes. Then in the data export, by crafting the filename, the user input will be written to the file system in the desired location.
- The vulnerability can be exploited to write malicious files in the web root and to make those accessible without authentication.
- The webserver runs with SYSTEM privileges which escalates the impact of the vulnerability, allowing the attacker full control over the system.
