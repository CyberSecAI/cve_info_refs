- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from incorrect calculation of buffer size when processing encrypted communication messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size. The software fails to properly handle buffer sizes during encrypted communication, leading to potential memory corruption or other issues when processing specially crafted messages.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a Denial-of-Service (DoS) condition by sending specially crafted messages to the affected system. This can compromise the availability of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have network access to the vulnerable system. The vulnerability is triggered when encrypted communication is enabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the target system. They do not require any system privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
