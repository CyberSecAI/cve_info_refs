SSA-270778: Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in SIMATIC PCS 7,
SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC NET PC Software

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

V1.8

SUMMARY

A Denial-of-Service vulnerability was found in SIMATIC PCS 7, SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC NET
PC software when encrypted communication is enabled. The vulnerability could allow an attacker with
network access to cause a Denial-of-Service condition under certain circumstances (versions prior to
SIMATIC WinCC V7.3 or SIMATIC PCS 7 V8.1 are not affected as encrypted communication is not an
option).

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

Note: The vulnerability is part of a shared component, used by various Siemens products (SIMATIC
Communication Services - SCS). The installation of a ﬁx version of any product also removes the
vulnerability for other products on the same system, even if those products were not updated.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Use VPN for protecting network communication between cells

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-19282

Through specially crafted messages, when encrypted communication is enabled, an attacker with
network access could use the vulnerability to compromise the availability of the system by causing
a Denial-of-Service condition. Successful exploitation requires no system privileges and no user
interaction.
