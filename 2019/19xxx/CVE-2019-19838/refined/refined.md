  "CVE-2019-19838": {
    "related_content": true,
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Command injection vulnerability in the `cmdImportAvpPort` function within the `emfd` binary.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper sanitization of user-supplied input leading to command injection.",
         "The `uploadFile` attribute from the request XML is directly inserted into a command string without proper sanitization."
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary command execution on the affected device.",
      "attack_vectors": "Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/uploaded/index.jsp` page, which then calls the vulnerable `cmdImportAvpPort()` function. This page is created by abusing another vulnerability.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface. They also need to have the ability to exploit another vulnerability to write a JSP file to the web directory and bypass authentication."
    },
        "additional_notes": "This vulnerability is part of a chain of vulnerabilities used to achieve remote code execution. It requires a previous arbitrary file write to create a new jsp page without any authentication checks, before the command injection vulnerability can be exploited. The command injection is achieved through the `uploadFile` parameter."
