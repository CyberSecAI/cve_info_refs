Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19191:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `shibboleth-sp` package's spec file contained a command that used `chown` to change the ownership of log files within a directory controlled by the `shibd` user, which runs the Shibboleth service. This action was performed after installation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Insecure file ownership:** The `chown` command, intended to correct file ownership, was executed on files within a directory where the `shibd` user had write permissions, even if that file was a symbolic link.
-   **Symbolic link vulnerability:**  An attacker could create a symbolic link within the log directory pointing to a sensitive file such as `/etc/shadow`, and the `chown` operation would then change the ownership of the targeted file to `shibd`, allowing the attacker (as the `shibd` user) to read or modify this file and escalate to root.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Local privilege escalation:** A local user with the privileges of the `shibd` user can exploit the vulnerability to gain root privileges, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Local access:** The attack requires local access to the system, and the ability to create symbolic links in the `shibd` user-controlled directory.
-   **Malicious symbolic link creation**: The attacker creates a symbolic link within `/var/log/shibboleth` that points to a sensitive file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   Attacker must have local access to the system.
-   Attacker must have the ability to create a symbolic link within a directory that the shibd user has write permissions to (e.g., `/var/log/shibboleth/`).
-   The attacker needs to be able to cause a reinstallation of shibboleth-sp or trigger the specific `chown` command within the spec file.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability exists due to a flawed `chown` command in the upstream spec file of shibboleth-sp versions prior to 3.1.0.
-   The vulnerability was resolved by correcting the file ownership handling in the spec file.
-   SUSE assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 to the issue, while NVD assigned 7.8
-   The fix was released across multiple SUSE products and openSUSE Leap 15.1.
-   The affected versions include Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) 3.x before 3.1.0.
-   The vulnerability is classified as a local privilege escalation issue and requires no user interaction.
