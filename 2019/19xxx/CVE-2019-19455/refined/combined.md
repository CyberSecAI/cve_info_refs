## New features and functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

Wowza Streaming Engine is a robust, customizable, and scalable media server software that powers reliable streaming of high-quality video and audio to any device, anywhere. Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 contains several enhancements and fixes that help to improve the functionality of the media server software.

#### WebRTC updates

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 includes significant upgrades and fixes for WebRTC functionality. We added support for configuring WebRTC streaming in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager and made WebRTC hosted test pages available for faster learning and testing. Additionally, we improved the accuracy of RTCP feedback messages for adaptive encoding when publishing WebRTC to Wowza Streaming Engine, and we improved the stability of WebRTC session timeouts. We also updated FIR messages to default to a more reliable time-based scheme, which enables a more regular interval for accessing WebRTC streams via a keyframe. For more information about WebRTC and Wowza Streaming Engine, see the following the articles:

* [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager](/docs/set-up-webrtc-streaming-with-wowza-streaming-engine-manager "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine Manager")
* [Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-webrtc-with-wowza-streaming-engine "Set up WebRTC streaming with Wowza Streaming Engine")
* [WebRTC workflows in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/webrtc-workflows-in-wowza-streaming-engine "WebRTC workflows in Wowza Streaming Engine")
* [Ingest RTSP, SRT, or RTMP streams into Wowza Streaming Engine for playback with WebRTC](/docs/ingest-rtsp-srt-or-rtmp-streams-into-wowza-streaming-engine-for-playback-with-webrtc "Ingest RTSP, SRT, or RTMP streams into Wowza Streaming Engine for playback with WebRTC")

#### SRT improvements

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 offers enhanced support for Secure Reliable Transport (SRT). We now support SRT version 1.4, which provides increased reliability. Other improvements include a number of new and renamed properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest and SRT stream targets and fixes for outstanding issues. For more information on newly available SRT properties, see the following articles:

* [Specify per-stream settings in Wowza Streaming Engine .stream files](/docs/how-to-specify-per-stream-settings-in-stream-files "Specify per-stream settings in Wowza Streaming Engine .stream files")
* [Use SRT to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-use-srt-to-distribute-live-streams "Use SRT to distribute live streams from Wowza Streaming Engine")

#### Low Latency HLS enhancements

Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 includes adjustments to the Low Latency HLS implementation to keep up-to-date with modifications to Apple’s preliminary protocol extension to the HLS spec. We've added support for the EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT media playlist tag, removed the HTTP/2 push delivery mechanism, and made other minor changes.

#### Performance upgrades

With Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5, we've increased playback performance for connections over SSL/TLS, updated the default server performance tuning, made general WebRTC performance upgrades, and updated MediaCaster ingest performance.

#### Security improvements

In Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5, we've fixed Wowza Streaming Engine Manager security concerns related to CSRF, authenticated XSS, and remote authenticated authorization. We've also added support for additional security-related HTTP headers in request responses, and we've enabled stricter Wowza Streaming Engine file access permissions on Linux and macOS.

## Installation and upgrade considerations for Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

We've repackaged the version of OpenJDK Java SE JRE 9.0.4 available with the release of Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 to address an issue that caused a memory leak in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager. To take advantage of this fix, use the custom packaged version of OpenJDK when upgrading to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 or later.

When using the Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5 installer to install a new instance of Wowza Streaming Engine on Windows, you may need to install additional dependencies in order to ingest SRT MediaCaster streams or use the generic SRT stream targets destination to publish an SRT stream. To address this, install the latest version of the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) appropriate to your operating system. This is not an issue for pre-existing installations of Wowza Streaming Engine that are updated to Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5.

## Breaking changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

If you're updating from a version of Wowza Streaming Engine earlier than 4.8.5, the following file and library changes break functionality if you don't take steps to address them.

### Wowza Streaming Engine REST API breaking changes

The Wowza Streaming Engine REST API authentication method values 'none' and 'basic' are no longer compatible with using Wowza Streaming Engine Manager to control and manage the media server software. If you plan to use Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, use 'digest', 'digestfile', or 'remotehttp' authentication methods instead (location: [install-dir]/conf/Server.xml, <RestInterface>/<AuthenticationMethod>).

### Wowza Streaming Engine built-in HTTP provider breaking changes

To enable security updates for Wowza Streaming Engine Manager, we removed two built-in HTTP providers: HTTPLiveStreamRecord and HTTPStreamManager. The Live Stream Record webpage (http://[wowza-ip-address]:8086/livestreamrecord) and the Stream Manager webpage (http://[wowza-ip-address]:8086/streammanager) are no longer available.

As a replacement for the Stream Manager HTTP provider and webpage, see [Create and use .stream files in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-create-and-use-stream-files-in-wowza-streaming-engine-manager "Create and use .stream files in Wowza Streaming Engine"). Alternatively, see [Create and manage stream files by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API](/docs/stream-management-query-examples "Create and manage stream files by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API") or [Control Stream class streams dynamically with a Wowza Streaming Engine Java module](/docs/how-to-control-stream-class-streams-dynamically-httpstreamcontrol "Control Stream class streams dynamically with a Wowza Streaming Engine Java module"). A compiled jar file with a customized version of the removed Stream Manager HTTP provider is available with instructions from Wowza support.

As a replacement for the Live Stream Record HTTP provider and webpage, see [Create and manage stream recorders by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API](/docs/stream-recording-query-examples "Create and manage stream recorders by using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API") or [Record live streams in Wowza Streaming Engine](/docs/how-to-record-live-streams-wowza-streaming-engine "Record live streams in Wowza Streaming Engine"). A compiled jar file with a customized version of the removed Live Stream Record HTTP provider is available with instructions from Wowza support.

## Detailed list of changes in Wowza Streaming Engine 4.8.5

---

#### Changes since 4.8.0 release

* Improved the Wowza Streaming Engine updater script to implement stricter file access permissions on Linux and macOS.
* Fixed an issue with the RTPDePacketizerWrapperReChunkMPEGTS property that allowed non-MPEG-TS data to be manipulated.
* Updated the Restlet framework library to version 2.3.12.
* Fixed issue where "@" characters were incorrectly filtered from data saved to XML files using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API.
* Fixed an issue where HTTP requests routed to HTTP Providers on HostPorts defined in VHost.xml would throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
* Fixed an issue with search functionality in Wowza Streaming Engine Java API reference documentation.
* Added support for the Connection HTTP header in HTTP providers.
* Added a new property (name: cupertinoCacheableSegments, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<HTTPStreamer>/<Properties>, type: Boolean, default: false) to enable identical segment URLs inside each session media playlist to support caching of segments for live or live edge applications.
* Fixed an issue with returning incorrect H.265 video codec information with calls to get incoming streams using the Wowza Streaming Engine REST API (version 3).
* Fixed an issue that caused a null pointer exception when using the live-record StreamType and specifying a recording file format that is not supported, such as MP3.
* Removed the Wowza Player page from Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Changed the loadBalanceHTTPOutputClasses property name to loadbalanceHTTPOutputClasses in the Dynamic Load Balancing AddOn 4.5 to fix an issue with output classes not loading.

#### WebRTC

* Fixed issue that caused WebRTC playback connections to ignore the maximumPlaybackConnections property for ModuleCoreSecurity.
* Improved the calculation for the jitter value sent in a receiver report for WebRTC MediaCaster ingest. The jitter value is now calculated according to IETF RFC 3550.
* Improved WebRTC publisher and player timeouts as well as resource deallocation.
* Added the ability to block publishing and playing of WebRTC streams when using the IMediaStreamNameAliasProvider3 Java API interface.
* Fixed issues with WebRTC session initiation for streams that used query parameters in their stream names.
* Added support for configuring WebRTC streaming for live applications in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Added support for enabling WebRTC for Virtual Host host ports in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Added support for negative acknowledgements (NACK) to make RTCP feedback messages more accurate, which aids in adaptive encoding and reduces packet loss when publishing WebRTC streams to Wowza Streaming Engine.
  + Added support for a jitter buffer for WebRTC streaming that is capable of handling out of order and retransmitted packets. The jitter buffer can be enabled with the rtpDePacketizerWrapper property (location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; value: com.wowza.wms.rtp.depacketizer.JitterBuffer).
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: useNack; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to enable sending of NACK messages to publishing clients to allow for retransmission of lost packets. The jitter buffer must also be enabled for this property to work.
    - Added a new property (name: jitterBufferDelay; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 500) to configure the delay added by the jitter buffer. The time, in milliseconds, allows for out-of-order and retransmitted packets to be played in order, provided they are received in time.
    - Added a new property (name: jitterBufferDebug; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to debug information about retransmitted packets and whether they were retrieved in time.
    - Added a new property (name: logPacketLoss; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<RTP>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) to enable logging when packets are lost.
* Changed the default Full Intra Request (FIR) message scheme to be time based instead of frame based to enable a more regular interval for accessing WebRTC streams via a keyframe.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: webrtcFIRMessageScheme, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<WebRTC>/<Properties>, type: string, default: time) that specifies the scheme for the FIR message interval.
    - Added a new property (name: webrtcFIRMessageInterval, location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<WebRTC>/<Properties>, type: integer, default: 1000) that specifies the interval between FIR messages.
  + Deprecated the following properties:
    - webrtcKeyFrameType. Use the webrtcFIRMessageScheme property instead.
    - webrtcKeyFrameTimeInterval. Use the webrtcFIRMessageInterval property instead.
    - webrtcKeyFrameTimeIntervalThreshold. No replacement is needed.
* Fixed an issue with WebRTC streams sent over TCP not maintaining a high bitrate.
* Fixed an issue with the format of RTCP receiver reports by including an SDES packet containing a CNAME for WebRTC MediaCaster ingest.
* Removed Vorbis from the list of preferred audio codecs for WebRTC in Application.xml.
* Fixed an issue with the server failing to start up properly when a virtual host was configured to listen for WebRTC WebSocket connections on a HostPort that did not have SSL/TLS enabled.
* Fixed an issue with UDP sessions sometimes failing to close for WebRTC sessions due to a race condition.

#### RTP/RTSP

* Fixed an issue with RTSP streaming that caused a null pointer exception to occur when using a jitter buffer.
* Added support for IP address message filtering for UDP messages received within an RTSP or RTP/RTCP session. This filtering can eliminate stream cross-talk when a disconnected RTSP source continues to send UDP messages to the same ports after the ports have been reallocated to a new RTSP connection.
  + Added a new property to enable IP address message filtering on RTSP streams (name: rtspCheckIpAddresses, type: Boolean, path: Root/Application/RTP, default: false).
  + For applications that support RTSP sources that use different IP addresses for their RTSP and RTP/RTCP communications, IP address filtering for RTSP streams shouldn't be enabled. If it is enabled, all packets will be dropped.
* Updated the name of the property used to enable debug logging for RTSP streams (name: rtspDebugSession, path: Root/Application/RTP, type: Boolean,  default: false). The property can also be used in a .stream file to affect only the steam associated with the file. This property replaces rtpDebugSession.

#### SRT

* Updated the SRT implementation to version 1.4 for increased reliability.
* Fixed an issue where the onStreamStop() callback for SRT sometimes had a null stream. There is always a stream object available when calling mediacaster.getStream().
* Fixed a memory leak that could be caused by disconnecting and reconnecting SRT MediaCaster streams.
* Made the following updates to .stream file properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest:
  + Deprecated the following properties:
    - srtDataTimeout. Use the streamTimeout parameter instead (name: streamTimeout; location: [*install-dir*]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Integer). This prompts Wowza Streaming Engine to monitor the stream. If a break occurs in the stream that's longer than the streamTimeout value, in milliseconds, it resets the connection to the camera.
    - srtTrafficType. There is no replacement needed.
    - SendBufferSize. There is no replacement needed.
    - SendBufferSizeUDP. There is no replacement needed.
  + Renamed the following properties:
    - The srtLatency property (name: srtLatency; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 400) replaces srtRecoveryBuffer and specifies the latency, in milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a UDP packet to be sent and delivered, including the time required to account for sending and retransmitting lost packets. The srtLatency value should be 2.5 times the round trip time (RTT). When peers set different latency values, the maximum of the two values applies to both peers.
    - The srtReceiveBufferSize property (name: srtReceiveBufferSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 12058624) replaces receiveBufferSize and specifies the receive buffer size, in bytes.
    - The srtReceiveBufferSizeUDP property (name: srtReceiveBufferSizeUDP; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 12288000) replaces receiveBufferSizeUDP and specifies the receive buffer size for UDP connections, in bytes.
    - The srtTimestampBasedDeliveryMode property (name: srtTimestampBasedDeliveryMode; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) replaces srtTimeMode and specifies whether the SRT time-stamp based packet delivery mode is enabled.
    - The srtTooLatePacketDrop property (name: srtTooLatePacketDrop; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) replaces srtLatePacketDrop and specifies whether all packets that are received late are dropped.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: srtDebug; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: false) that specifies whether to write additional details to log files for SRT workflow debugging.
    - Added a new property (name: srtFlightFlagSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 25600) that specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be sent without being acknowledged.
    - Added a new property (name: srtInputBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that works with srtOverheadBandwidth to specificy the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100. If srtInputBandwidth is set to 0, then input bandwidth is estimated from the rate of input during transmission.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyAnnounce; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0x1000) that specifies the interval between when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyRefreshRate; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0x1000000) that specifies the number of packets to be transmitted with an encryption key before switching to a new key.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: -1) that specifies the maximum bandwidth, in bytes per second, that the connection can use. Valid values are -1 (infinite), 0 (calculated from srtInputBandwidth and srtOverheadBandwidth), and integers greater than 0 for an absolute limit in bytes per second.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumSegmentSize; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 1500) that specifies the maximum size for a unit of transfer data (MTU), in bytes. For MPEG-TS streams, use the default.
    - Added a new property (name: srtOverheadBandwidth; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 25) that works with srtInputBandwidth to specificy the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100.
    - Added a new property (name: srtPacketLossTolerance; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that specifies the maximum packet reorder tolerance, which is the number of packets to receive after loss before sending a loss report. When set to 0, the loss report is sent immediately when there is a gap in a sequence.
    - Added a new property (name: srtReconnectWaitTime; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 3000) that specifies, in milliseconds, how often the listener looks for an incoming stream. If a source drops, and the immediate reconnection attempt fails, the system waits this amount of time before looking for an incoming stream again.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendNakReports; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: Boolean; default: true) that enables the receiver to send periodic NAK (Negative Acknowledgment) packet reports.
    - Added a new property (name: srtTimesToPrintStats; location: [install-dir]/conf/[*application name*]/Application.xml, <Application>/<MediaCaster>/<Properties>; type: integer; default: 0) that specifies how many times stream statistics are written into the log after the stream starts. Statistics are logged each second. Set to -1 to log statistics indefinitely.
* Previously added SRT properties for SRT MediaCaster ingest can now be configured in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Made the following updates to SRT Stream Target properties, which can be configured in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager or the PushPublishMap.txt file:
  + Renamed the following property:
    - The srtLatency property (name: srtLatency, type: Integer, default: 400) replaces Recovery Buffer and specifies the latency, in milliseconds. This is the time it takes for a UDP packet to be sent and delivered, including the time required to account for sending and retransmitting lost packets. The srtLatency value should be 2.5 times the round trip time (RTT). When peers set different latency values, the maximum of the two values applies to both peers.
  + Added support for the following new properties:
    - Added a new property (name: srtConnectTimeout, type: integer, default: 3000) that specifies how long Wowza Streaming Engine waits for a target to respond to a connection request.
    - Added a new property (name: srtFlightFlagSize, type: integer, default: 25600) that specifies the maximum number of bytes that can be sent without being acknowledged.
    - Added a new property (name: srtInputBandwidth, type: integer, default: 0) that works with srtOverheadBandwidth to specify the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100. If srtInputBandwidth is set to 0, then input bandwidth is estimated from the rate of input during transmission.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyAnnounce, type: integer, default: 0x1000) that specifies the interval between when a new encryption key is sent and when switchover occurs. This value also applies to the subsequent interval between when switchover occurs and when the old encryption key is decommissioned.
    - Added a new property (name: srtKeyRefreshRate, type: integer, default: 0x1000000) that specifies the number of packets to be transmitted with an encryption key before switching to a new key.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumBandwidth, type: integer, default: -1) that specifies the maximum bandwidth, in bytes per second, that the connection can use. Valid values are -1 (infinite), 0 (calculated from srtInputBandwidth and srtOverheadBandwidth), and integers greater than 0 for an absolute limit in bytes per second.
    - Added a new property (name: srtMaximumSegmentSize, type: integer, default: 1500) that specifies the maximum size for a unit of transfer data (MTU), in bytes. For MPEG-TS streams, use the default.
    - Added a new property (name: srtOverheadBandwidth, type: integer, default: 25) that works with srtInputBandwidth to specify the maximum bandwidth, only if srtMaximumBandwidth is set to 0. Uses this formula: max bandwidth = input bandwidth \* (100 + overhead bandwidth)/100.
    - Added a new property (name: srtPeerIdleTimeout, type: integer, default: 5000) that specifies, in milliseconds, the peer idle timeout, or the maximum time of silence heard from a peer.
    - Added a new property (name: srtStreamId, type: string, default: none) that populates a string sent on the socket prior to connecting. Length is a maximum of 512 characters. If using a stream ID, a peer connection must have a minimum SRT version of 1.3.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendBufferSize, type: integer, default: 12058624) that specifies the send buffer size, in bytes.
    - Added a new property (name: srtSendBufferSizeUDP, type: integer, default: 65536) that specifies the send buffer size for UDP connections, in bytes.
    - Added a new property (name: srtTimesToPrintStats, type: integer, default: 0) that specifies how many times stream statistics are written into the log after the stream starts. Statistics are logged each second. Set to -1 to log statistics indefinitely.

#### HLS, Low-Latency HLS, and CMAF

* Fixed an issue with Low Latency HLS that caused player requests for partial segments associated with completed media segments to fail with 404 resource not found errors.
* Removed support for the HTTP/2 push delivery mechanism.
* Added support for the EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT media playlist tag.
* Added support for blocking partial segment requests based on EXT-X-PRELOAD-HINT tags.
* Added support for setting PART-HOLD-BACK in all media playlists in a multi-rendition, adaptive-bitrate playback session to at least three times the maximum PART-TARGET value across the renditions.

#### MPEG-DASH

* Fixed an issue with the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API that caused the LiveStreamPacketizer to fail to set a value for the mpegdashSegmentDurationTarget property.
* Fixed an issue with CMAF-packetized MPEG-DASH live stream encryption using key files. Previously, including both mpegdashstreaming-cenc and cmafstreaming-cenc entries in a key file could result in the generation of an invalid MPD file.
* Added millisecond precision to dates for the availibilityStartTime and publishTime properties in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files for live applications.
* Fixed an issue with the sample duration value under MP4 track headers that was causing playback issues for MPEG-DASH VOD streams on ExoPlayer players in Android apps.
* Fixed an issue with increasing heap memory with MPEG-DASH stream targets when Playlist Count (http.playlistCount) was set to a high value.
* Fixed an issue with the mpegdashSegmentDurationTarget property not being read correctly for MPEG-DASH VOD streams.
* Fixed an issue with setting the Akamai Event Name and Adaptive Group properties and enabling relative playlists (http.relativePlaylists) for MPEG-DASH Akamai stream targets that resulted in an incorrect BaseURL value in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files.
* Fixed an issue with setting the Akamai Event Name property, setting the Destination Server property to redundant, and enabling relative playlists (http.relativePlaylists) for MPEG-DASH Akamai stream targets that resulted in an incorrect primary BaseURL value in MPEG-DASH MPD manifest files.

#### Live Stream Encoding, Decoding, Transcoding, and Transrating

* Fixed a performance regression when using NVIDIA hardware accelerated decoding on multiple graphics cards that lead to dropped frames before hardware limits were reached.
* Fixed an issue that created extra transcoding sessions and didn't clean them up properly.
* Fixed an issue with RTMP streams that use H.264 Annex B start codes not processing.
* Fixed an issue with decoded frame sizes not updating correctly when accessed through the video decoder API in the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API.
* Fixed an issue that caused transcoder sessions to not close down properly when quickly republishing a stream.

#### Stream Targets (Push Publishing)

* Fixed an issue that caused the creation of duplicate Group Manager, Wowza Streaming Cloud, and Wowza CDN stream target sessions when a new target was added, an existing target was modified or restarted, or targets were enabled.
* Fixed an issue with HLS-based stream targets where a restart of a stream's Cupertino packetizer due to source stream issues resulted in associated stream targets failing to push the stream.

#### Live Stream DVR Playback (Wowza nDVR)

* Added a new interface, IDvrConverterActionNotify, for the Wowza Streaming Engine Java API. This interface invokes onConversionComplete after DVR conversion finishes, sending a notification to registered onConversionComplete listeners with the DVR store handle and the converted file’s name.
* Fixed an issue with MPEG-DASH nDVR functionality that caused video duration to decrease during playback.
* Fixed an issue with the dvrPacketSortTime property. When dvrPacketSortTime was set to add latency to DVR playback, additional unnecessary log messages appeared in the log file. With updated behavior, logs show a single entry when a problem arises in the DVR stream.

#### Performance improvements

* Improved performance of players connecting over SSL/TLS for TCP streaming.
* Updated the MediaCaster transport handler to use the VHost transport thread pool to increase throughput when many MediaCaster streams are used.
* Increased the defaults for Java heap size and several thread counts when using auto-tuning to better match modern hardware capabilities and increase server throughput.
* Updated the Wowza Streaming Engine Manager limits for Java heap size and thread counts to better match modern hardware capabilities.

#### Security improvements

* Added support for the following security-related HTTP headers in request responses with Content-Type: text/html:
  + Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'
  + X-Frame-Options: deny
  + X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  + X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  + Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
* Upgraded the jQuery library to version 3.5.1.
* Fixed several issues with authenticated XSS security vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Fixed several issues with CSRF security vulnerabilities in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.
* Fixed an issue with a remote authenticated authorization bypass security vulnerability that could allow an unauthorized user to make changes in Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.

# Vulnerability Research & Advisor

### FinalitÃ  e modalitÃ  operative

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/meno.svg)

Nellâambito delle attivitÃ  di Cybersecurity di TIM, Ã¨ stato costituito un gruppo di lavoro dedicato allâesecuzione di Security Assessment (Red Team), che si occupa di analizzare software sviluppato on-demand, software di mercato e firmware.

Tra gli obiettivi del team câÃ¨ quello di rilevare le vulnerabilitÃ  che un potenziale attaccante potrebbe sfruttare per eseguire degli attacchi informatici verso le infrastrutture di TIM ed evidenziarne gli impatti reali rilevati.

LâattivitÃ  non si limita alla sola verifica delle vulnerabilitÃ  note, ma include unâattivitÃ  di ricerca specifica con lâobiettivo di scoprire eventuali nuove vulnerabilitÃ  non ancora conosciute pubblicamente (vulnerabilitÃ  0day).

Qualora vengano rilevate vulnerabilitÃ  0day, si procede con una âdivulgazione responsabileâ verso il produttore del prodotto analizzato, comunicandogli prontamente e in via confidenziale le vulnerabilitÃ  scoperte, in modo che possa replicarle e produrre una contromisura (patch) entro 90 giorni dalla notifica ricevuta.

In seguito al rilascio della contromisura (patch), oppure trascorsi i 90 giorni dalla segnalazione, si procede alla pubblicazione, classificando le vulnerabilitÃ  sul Mitre (CVE, Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

Analoghe azioni vengono intraprese nellâambito dei processi di Security Testing e Gestione Incidenti (Incident Handling) di TIM, qualora portino a scoprire vulnerabilitÃ  non ancora note al produttore e alla comunitÃ .

### CVE-2024-52949â iptraf-ng

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: Stack-based Buffer Overflow - CWE-121

**Software Version**: 1.2.1

**NIST**: https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-52949

**CVSS**:

**Severity:**

**Credits**: Massimiliano Ferraresi, Massimiliano Brolli

A stack-based buffer overflow condition is a condition where the buffer being overwritten is allocated on the stack (i.e., is a local variable or, rarely, a parameter to a function). Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

During an assessment we fuzzed the -C argument with AFL++ with the following command

sudo ./afl-fuzz -i /in -o /out -- ./iptraf-ng -C @@

The /in directory contains various types of playlists that AFL can fuzz and iterate over. After one day of fuzzing, we found 4 types of config that crash iptraf-ng. The issue consistently occurs in the strcpy function doesnât control the size and is possible to overflow memory in the stack

### CVE-2024-49351â IBM Workload Scheduler

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Plaintext Storage of a Password- CWE-256

**Software Version:** 9.5.0

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-49351>

**CVSS:**5.5

**Severity:** Medium

**Credits:** Alberto Arganese, Cristian Castrechini, Federico Draghelli, Massimiliano Brolli

An Improper Password Storage vulnerability exists in the connection properties panel under the Administration tab. This flaw allows authenticated remote attackers with administrator privileges to access and read the engine connection password in cleartext.

**Security impact**

Attackers who obtain this information can gain unauthorized access to sensitive systems, potentially escalating privileges and compromising data. This exposure can further enable lateral movement within the network, increasing the attack surface. Ultimately, it undermines the integrity of the entire system, leading to potential data breaches and reputational damage.

### CVE-2024-9329 â Eclipse Glassfish

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Improper Handling of Parameters - CWE-233

**Software Version:** 7.0.15

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9329>

**CVSS:** 6.1

**Severity:** Medium

**Credits:** Marco Ventura, Claudia Bartolini, Andrea Carlo Maria Dattola, Debora Esposito, Massimiliano Brolli

The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/management/domain'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /management/domain endpoint is requested via an HTTP GET request.

**Affected Endpoints**

URL: https://[IP]:[PORT]/management/domain

HTTP Parameter: Host

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/responsible-disclosure/HostParam.jpg)

Figure 2: payload and evidence

[Click To Enlarge](https://www.gruppotim.it/content/dam/gt/footer/responsible-disclosure/HostChangedVuln.jpg)

To perform this attack, the attacker does not need to be authenticated to the target application.

Security Impact

An attacker can construct a URL within the application that causes a redirection to an arbitrary external domain. This behaviour can be leveraged to facilitate phishing attacks against users of the application. The ability to use an authentic application URL, targeting the correct domain and with a valid SSL certificate (if SSL is used), lends credibility to the phishing attack because many users, even if they verify these features, will not notice the subsequent redirection to a different domain.

### CVE-2024-9054 â Microchip TP4100

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description**: RCE on file configuration parameter - CWE-78

**Software Version**: 2.3.12

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-9054>

**CVSS**: 8.8

**Severity:** High

**Credits**: Armando Huesca Prida, Marco Negro, Antonio Carriero, Vito Pistillo, Davide Renna, Manuel Leone, Massimiliano Brolli

The device doesn't correctly sanitize parameters content of the configuration file. An attacker able to upload a new configuration file could insert in the parameter 'secret\_key' malicious bash commands that will be executed by the device.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user has got a configuration file or can download it from the device web GUI . This user could locally modify the content of this file because it is in cleartext. Specifically, a bash command could be inserted in a parameter (âshared\_keyâ) present in the xml structure of the file. Once this file is loaded, after authentication, through the web GUI, the device executes the command inserted.

**Affected Endpoints**

**URL:** http://<device\_IP>/config\_restore

**XML Parameter:** secret\_key

Below the evidence with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

POST /config\_restore HTTP/1.1

Figure 3: RCE

[Click To Enlarge](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/9054/RCE.jpg)

**Security Impact**

A malicious user with the access to the web GUI of the device could insert a bash command to construct a reverse shell to the device and to control it. Another situation could be represented by a malicious user that reaches the device network and knows the structure of the configuration file, that, through social engineering techniques, forces a user with access to the web GUI to load the infected file and to reach the same objective reported above.

**Credits**: Marco Ventura, Claudia Bartolini, Massimiliano Brolli

In OpenTextâ¢ Operations Agent, version 12.20, 12.21, 12.22, 12.23, 12.24, 12.25 and 12.26, is possible to perform Cross-site scripting Stored attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to compromise the interactions that users have with the vulnerable application. Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities normally allow an attacker to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions that the user is able to perform, and to access any of the user's data. If the victim user has privileged access within the application, then the attacker might be able to gain full control over all of the application's functionality and data.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user that has the permissions to modify the agent configuration file, can perform Cross-site scripting Stored attacks. In particular, by adding a malicious payload within the CORE\_ID value, the attacker can inject an arbitrary javascript code in the HTML page.

The server does not properly handle application errors. In some cases, this leads to a disclosure of information about the server.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

An unauthenticated user is able craft specific requests in order to make the application generate an error. Inside this error, some information about the server is revealed, like the absolute path of the source code of the application. This kind of information can help an attacker to perform other attacks against the system. This vulnerability can be exploited without authentication.

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

The Web application does not properly check the parameters sent as input before they are processed on the server side. This allows authenticated users  to execute commands on the Operating System.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The application does not properly check the parameters sent as input before they are used to construct an OS command that will be executed on the operating system of the server. Due to the lack of validation of user input, an attacker is allowed to replace and inject arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the application user. This vulnerability is âblindâ, meaning that the output of the command is not reflected in the server response.

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

**CVSv3**: **6.5**

**Severity: Medium**

**Credits**: Luca Borzacchiello, Massimiliano Brolli

An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk through v018. An Insecure Direct Object Reference can occur under the 5.6.5-3/doc/{ID-FILE]/c/{N]/{C]/websocket endpoint. A malicious unauthenticated user can access cached files in the OnlyOffice backend of other users by guessing the file ID of a target file.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A malicious user can fool vShare (through a WebSocket) to return a link to the OnlyOffice

cache of text files, even of other users.

The vulnerability can be exploited in the following way:

1.     the attacker opens a text file in his vShare, this will open a websocket towards vdeskoffice;

2.     the attacker looks at the history of websocket requests, and finds the one that asks for the cached file;

the attacker modifies the ID of its own file with the target one. The target ID could be obtained: (a) performing a brute-force attack (32-bit of entropy), (b) looking at the browser 1.     history of the victim, and looking for a link with the following shape: [...]/5.6.5-3/doc/[ID]/... where [ID] is the target file ID.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/vulnerability-research/CVE-2022-45175_1.png)

Figure 1 Websocket payload with a spoofed "docid" (in yellow). The destination websocket is opened by the attacker and has the following shape: vdeskoffice.[HOST]/5.6.5-3/doc/[ID-FILE]/c/[N]/[C]/websocket. Notice that [ID-FILE] is the ID of the file of the attacker, and its different from the one inserted in the body of the websocket.

Because only the client-side verifies whether a check was successful, an attacker can modify the response, and fool the application into concluding that the TOTP was correct.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The web application implements two-factor authentication through a TOTP code. To check

whether the inserted TOTP is correct, the web-application implements the API

/api/v1/vdeskintegration/challenge. Unfortunately, only the client-side verifies

whether the check was successful, allowing an attacker to modify the response, and fool the

application that the TOTP was correct.

The Web Application is affected by SQL Injection vulnerability. Through the injection of arbitrary SQL statements, a potential attacker can modify query syntax and perform unauthorized (and unexpected) operations against the remote database.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

A remote user, authenticated to the web application may manipulate the request parameters to exploit error output from the database to manipulate its data. It manipulates the database into generating an error that informs the actor of the databaseâs structure and afterwards extracts the data contents in the database statement. Please see the examples below for step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability.

**Affected Endpoints**

Â·       **URL:** https://<host>/cgi-bin/R19.9/easy1350.pl?action=edit\_master&session=[REDACTED]&id=1host=1

Â·       **HTTP Parameter:** id, host

Below are the evidences with the vulnerability details and the payloads used.

**Software Version**: v22.0.0.62

**NIST**: <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30280>

**CVSv3**: **8.8**

**Severity: High**

/SecurityManagement/html/createuser.jsf in Nokia NetAct 22 allows CSRF. A remote attacker is able to create users with arbitrary privileges, even administrative privileges. The application (even if it implements a CSRF token for the random GET request) does not ever verify a CSRF token. With a little help of social engineering/phishing (such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. If the victim is a normal user, a successful CSRF attack can force the user to perform state changing requests like transferring funds, changing their email address, and so forth. If the victim is an administrative account, CSRF can compromise the entire web application.

**Step-by-step instructions and PoC**

The vulnerable functionality can be reached through the following actions:

* Impostazioni Dispositivo > Sistema

  A PoC is possibile intercepting the POST request to */dvcset/sysset/set.cgi*, after update the settings on the page.  Then we can insert the malicious string in the arg01.Hostname parameter:

* <img src=# onerror=alert(1337)/>

  This payload needs to be URL encoded in order to bypass client-side security filters. Subsequently, we visit the */jobs* page to spawn the Javascript malicious code.

**Affected Endpoints**

* **URL:** /dvcset/sysset/set.cgi
* **HTTP Parameter:** Host (arg01.Hostname)

### CVE-2021-41555 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Multiple Stored Cross-Site Scripting - CWE-79

**Software Version:** 21.3.3.815

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41555>

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), XSS occurs in **/archibus/dwr/call/plaincall/workflow.runWorkflowRule.dwr** because the data received as input from clients is re-included within the HTTP response returned by the application without adequate validation. In this way, if HTML code or client-side executable code (e.g., Javascript) is entered as input, the expected execution flow could be altered. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-41554 â ARCHIBUS Web Central

**CVSv3: 8.8

Severity**: **High

Credits:** Luca Carbone, Mattia Campanelli, Alessandro Sabetta, Massimiliano Brolli

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to data and functionality in these affected endpoints:

**/archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-data-dictionary-table.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw**, **/archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-profile.axvw**. By not verifying the permissions for access to resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can reach the administrative console for user management by directly requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page.  This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

\*\* UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED \*\*

In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a version from 2014), the Web Application in **/archibus/login.axvw** assign a session token that could be already in use by another user. It was therefore possible to access the application through a user whose credentials were not known, without any attempt by the testers to modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of the session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated GET Request to the Home Page and adding an arbitrary value to the **JSESSIONID** field. The application, following the login, does not assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the identifier of the entire session. This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26.

**NOTE**: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

### CVE-2021-38123 â Micro Focus Network Automation

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Open Redirect - CWE-601

**Software Version:** <= 2019.05

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-38123>

**CVSv3: 6.1

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Veno Eivazian, Massimiliano Brolli

The Host HTTP parameter could cause the web application to redirect to the specified URL, when the requested endpoint is '/device.save.do'. By modifying the URL value to a malicious site, an attacker may successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials.

The application presents an Open Redirect on the Host parameter, when the /device.save.do endpoint is requested via an HTTP POST request.

To exploit the vulnerability, the following HTTP request is used:

POST /device.save.do HTTP/1.1

Host: this.is.my.domain.evil.net

Cache-Control: no-cache

User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,\*/\*;q=0.8

Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5

Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate

Origin: https://hostname

Connection: close

Referer: https://hostname/device.edit.do?deviceID=201

Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

Content-Length: 0

An attacker can send a link containing JavaScript code that allows a user who runs the code to be automatically redirected to a domain owned by the attacker himself.

The redirect is performed via the HTTP **Location** response header.

### CVE-2021-35492 â Wowza Streaming Engine

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:**Â Uncontrolled Resource Consumption â CWE-400

A remote user, authenticated to the Wowza Streaming Engine web interface, through **Virtual Host Monitoring** section, could exhaust filesystem resources, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected application. This vulnerability is due to the insufficient management of available filesystem resources. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by requesting random virtual host historical data and exhausting available filesystem resources. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause database errors and cause the device to become unresponsive to web-based management. Manual intervention is required to free filesystem resources and return the application to an operational state.

To exploit the vulnerability, intercept the browser session with a proxy like Burp Suite.

Then, go to the **Virtual Host Monitoring** section:

![CVE-2021-35492-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-1.png)

*FigureÂ 1: DoS - Virtual Host Monitoring - Web Interface*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-1.png)

An HTTP request will be automatically performed to view the historical data of the default virtual host.

The request on Burp Suite will be like the next screenshot.

![CVE-2021-35492-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-2.png)

*FigureÂ 2: DoS - Regular HTTP request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-2.png)

Every time virtual host monitoring data is requested, a new file is created or appended on the filesystem.

By default, this is the starting condition on the folder /usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine-4.8.11+5/stats/:

![CVE-2021-35492-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-3.png)

*FigureÂ 3: DoS - Filesystem on normal condition*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-3.png)

The attack can be performed using Burp Repeater, using the same request captured with the proxy, changing only the **vhost** parameter value. The response will be **HTTP 200 OK**:

![CVE-2021-35492-4](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-4.png)

*FigureÂ 4: DoS - New virtual host HTTP request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-4.png)

Alternatively, the same can be achieved with the following payload:

GET /enginemanager/server/vhost/historical.jsdata?vhost=\_defaultVHost\_pippo\_&periodStart=2021-06-03T13%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&periodEnd=2021-06-03T14%3A47%3A44%2B02%3A00&\_=1622724285834 HTTP/1.1

On the filesystem side, a new file of 280 KB will be created, as depicted by the following screenshot:

![CVE-2021-35492-5](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-5.png)

*FigureÂ 5: DoS - New virtual host file on the filesystem*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-5.png)

To massively exploit this condition, multiple requests with different **vhost** values have to be sent.

To send those requests reliably, the browser session has to be left active.

Session timeout can be prevented by installing a browser plugin like **Tab Reloader** and configure it to refresh the tab every 1 minute, like the following example:

![CVE-2021-35492-6](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-6.png)

*FigureÂ 6: DoS - Session timeout prevention - Tab Reloader*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-6.png)

Then it is possible to create a custom script to randomize the vhost parameter to a new value to be sent every time.

./dos-exploit-wse.py

When executing such tool, it is possible to exhaust the filesystem by creating **5.5 GB** of files every **30 minutes**.

The effect can be summarized on the following screenshot, which depicts multiple files created on the filesystem and the difference of the **stats** directory size after 30 minutes of the tool execution:

![CVE-2021-35492-7](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35492-7.png)

### CVE-2021-35491 â Wowza Streaming Engine

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) - CWE-352

**Software Version:** <= 4.8.11+5

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35491>

**CVSv3: 8.1

Severity**: **High

Credits:** Veno Eivazian, Massimiliano Brolli

A remote attacker is able to delete a user without the victim's knowledge, by enticing an authenticated admin user to visit an attacker's web page. The application does not implement a CSRF token for the GET request. An attacker can craft an HTML page with a forged request on /enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm URL and send it to the victim.

Prerequisites: None.

Step-by-step instructions and PoC

An authenticated user that visits a crafted HTML page with a forged request can delete a user on Wowza Streaming Engine on behalf of an administrator.

To exploit the vulnerability, a new user needs to be created for testing purpose.

First, create a new user from **Server** -> **Users** -> **Add User**.

![CVE-2021-35491-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-1.png)

*Figure 1: CSRF - User creation*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-1.png)

Then, **copy** the following HTML to a file served on another machine, in this case a local Kali Linux, in the file: /var/www/html/csrf-delete-user.html

<html>

     <body>

          <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>

          <form action="http://wse.local:8088/enginemanager/server/user/delete.htm">

               <input type="hidden" name="userName" value="pippo" />

               <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />

          </form>

     </body>

</html>

Enable the local web server on the attacker machine:

sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

From an authenticated browser session to Wowza Streaming Engine with administrative privileges, open a new tab and go to the page http://127.0.0.1/csrf-delete-user.html.

![CVE-2021-35491-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-2.png)

*Figure 2: CSRF - PoC HTML page*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-2.png)

Select **Submit request**, to force the administrator to delete the selected user.

The request will be sent to the web application, and the user will be deleted:

*Figure 3: CSRF - User deleted*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35491-3.png)

It was also found that the **wowzaSecurityToken** HTTP parameter is not present in this GET request. In this case, the application accepts the request and processes it every time.

This is not true in the case of user creation, where that parameter is present and correctly validated.

Thruk version 2.40-2 allows /thruk/#cgi-bin/extinfo.cgi?type=2&host=[HOSTNAME]&service=[SERVICENAME]&backend=[BACKEND] Reflected XSS on 'host' and 'service' parameters. A malicious user leveraging this vulnerability could inject arbitrary JavaScript into extinfo.cgi. The malicious payload will then be triggered every time an authenticated user browses the page containing it.

The vulnerable functionality can be reached through the following URL:

* /thruk/#cgi-bin/extinfo.cgi?type=2&host=[HOSTNAME]&service=[SERVICENAME]&backend=[BACKEND]

A PoC is possible inserting the malicious payload in one of the host or service fields (GET Request):

* --></script><script>alert(1337)</script>

This occurs due to the closure of a comment, as demonstrated in the next screenshot.

### CVE-2021-35487 â Nokia Broadcast Message Center

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

**Vulnerability Description:** Boolean Blind SQL Injection - CWE-89

**Software Version:** <= 11.1.0

**NIST:** <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-35487>

**CVSv3: 6.5

Severity**: **Medium

Credits:** Marco Raimondi, Francesco Pigini, Massimiliano Brolli

A remote user, authenticated on the Broadcast Message Center, can navigate the application in the ALERTS --> Manage Alerts section. Within Search Options it is possible to select Basic Search and by specifying the **extIdentifier** parameter, arbitrary queries in the application database can be executed.

Through these queries it is possible to extrapolate arbitrary information, not foreseen by the application logic, such as the user of the system that executes the queries, the dbms version, etc.

Depending on the permissions the user has on the database, different types of queries are possible and consequently different types of information can be extracted.

Payload used to exploit the vulnerability:

![CVE-2021-35487-0](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-0.png)

*Figure 0: Payload*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-0.png)

This first step consisted of inserting a single quote (') inside the search bar, in order to evaluate the behavior of the application. The result was an error message inside the database:

![CVE-2021-35487-1](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-1.png)

*Figure 1: Single quote database error message*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-1.png)

At this point we tried to see if it was possible to execute arbitrary queries on the application. In this specific case, we tried to get the name of the user who executes the queries on the database. To do this we combined the **mid()** and **user()** functions. Being a Blind SQL Injection, if the query result was "true" we would get all the database alerts, otherwise we would get nothing, and we would have to go on with the letters of the alphabet:

![CVE-2021-35487-2](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-2.png)

*Figure 2: True query request*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-2.png)

![CVE-2021-35487-3](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-3.png)

*Figure 3:Â True query page behavior with alarms*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-3.png)

The result of the query is the entire list of alarms, so the first letter of the username is after "**m**" in the alphabet.

![CVE-2021-35487-4](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-4.png)

*Figure 4:Â False query page behavior*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-4.png)

Using the letter **n**" we get nothing. Therefore, the first letter of the username is "**n**". Proceeding in this way it is possible to obtain the full name of the user.

At this point we try to confirm the username found by using the **user()** function directly:

![CVE-2021-35487-5](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-5.png)

*Figure 5:Â User() function true request*

*Figure 6:Â User() function true response page*

[Click here to enlarge the image](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2021-35487-6.png)

As we can see from the last image, using only the user() function with the name found from the previous steps, we get again the complete list of alarms, confirming that the username is correct.

Similarly, it is possible to proceed to get more information from the database.

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2019-17404.png)

**Vulnerability Description**: Full Path Disclosure

An authenticated user with access to the CDP component of NOKIA IMPACT is able to leak the full path of the installation. In particular, the massive device upload feature (devceimport) releases detailed information about the location where the files are saved within the application filesystem.

If the path traversal is exploited to point to a non-existent path the application will throw an unhandled exception, leaking the full path of where the files are saved (Full path disclosure)

### CVE-2019-17403 - NOKIA IMPACT

![](/content/dam/default/FAQ/piu.svg)

![](/content/dam/gt/footer/red-team/CVE-2019-17403.png)

**Vulnerability Description:**Â Unrestricted File Upload

An authenticated user with access to the CDP component of NOKIA IMPACT is able to upload files with arbitrary extensions.

TheÂ **deviceImport**Â function parses every file received with aÂ **csv\_parse**Â function. We managed to load a non-csv file adding at the beginning of it the following line followed by our payload.

We uploaded PHP Webshell in a path served by Apache (in our case /opt/[redacted]/5/) and got code execution as apache user.
