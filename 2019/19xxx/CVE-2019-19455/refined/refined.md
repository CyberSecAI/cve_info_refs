   - The content from `raw.githubusercontent.com_6f7e5812_20250121_003932.html` directly references CVE-2019-19455, and provides details that confirm its relevance.
   - The content from  `www.gruppotim.it_15d8f195_20250121_003935.html` also mentions CVE-2019-19455 with the associated summary description:  "A local privilege escalation was found in the Linux Version of the server. A user can write arbitrary commands in any file that can be executed as root." which aligns with the `raw.githubusercontent.com` information

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The root cause lies in the insecure default file permissions set during the installation of Wowza Streaming Engine on Linux systems. Specifically, the `/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/` directory and its contents have overly permissive write permissions.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732):** The core program files located in `/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/` are writable by any user on the system.
    *   **Local Privilege Escalation**: Due to the insecure permissions, a local unprivileged user can modify these executable files.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Code Execution:** By inserting arbitrary commands into files within `/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/`, a local user can achieve root level code execution.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** A user can gain root privileges by modifying files that are executed during server start or stop.
    *   The files in `/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/` are writable by anyone and are executed at boot or stop of the server as root.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the affected Linux server.
    *   **File Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to write to the executable files within the `/usr/local/WowzaStreamingEngine/manager/bin/` directory.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a user account on the Linux system where Wowza Streaming Engine is installed.
    *   The attacker does not need to have root privileges initially but is able to achieve code execution as root.

**3. Additional Notes**

*   **Resolution**: The vulnerability is fixed in Wowza Streaming Engine version 4.8.5
*   **Vendor Acknowledgment**: Wowza Media Systems LLC has confirmed and acknowledged the vulnerability.
*   **Type of attack**: local privilege escalation
