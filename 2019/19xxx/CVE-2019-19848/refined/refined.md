- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the way TYPO3 CMS extracts manually uploaded ZIP archives in the Extension Manager. It is vulnerable to directory traversal because it does not properly sanitize the filenames within the ZIP archive.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory Traversal. The lack of proper validation of filenames in the uploaded ZIP archives allows an attacker to specify paths that reach outside the intended extraction directory, leading to the creation of files in arbitrary locations on the server's filesystem.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with the required privileges could overwrite existing files, inject malicious code, or potentially gain a foothold on the server by writing files to arbitrary locations. This can lead to complete compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors:**  The attack vector is through the Extension Manager, by uploading a maliciously crafted ZIP archive containing files with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in their filenames.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have admin privileges to upload and extract ZIP archives using the Extension Manager. In versions 9 and later, the attacker also needs System Maintainer privileges. Additionally, the user interaction required is to upload a specially crafted zip file and extract it.
