  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-19630",
    "description": "In HTMLDOC, there was a one-byte underflow in htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx caused by a floating point math difference between GCC and Clang, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow in the hd_strlcpy() function in string.c when processing a crafted HTML document.",
    "root_cause": "A floating point math difference between GCC and Clang caused a one-byte underflow in htmldoc/ps-pdf.cxx, which cascaded into a stack-based buffer overflow in the `hd_strlcpy()` function in string.c.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "One-byte underflow",
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The stack-based buffer overflow could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "A crafted HTML document is processed by htmldoc.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted HTML document as input to htmldoc."
