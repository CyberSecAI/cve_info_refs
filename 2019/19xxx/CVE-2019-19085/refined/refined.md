Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19085:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, an authenticated user with edit permissions can upload a maliciously crafted file. This file contains malicious web script or HTML, which can then be injected into the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw. The injected malicious code is stored within the application (likely in a database) and executed when other users view the affected content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Web Script or HTML Injection:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code. This malicious code can perform various actions in the context of the victim's browser, including:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies
    *   Redirecting users to malicious sites
    *   Defacing the web page
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the victim

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Upload of Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is through uploading a specially crafted file.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with edit permissions to upload the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the affected Octopus Server.
*   **Edit Permissions:** The user must have permissions that allow them to upload files.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Octopus Server versions 3.4.0 through 2019.10.5 are affected.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as low severity.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   **Patch:** A fix was implemented in version 2019.10.4.
*   **OctopusDeploy Issue:** The issue is tracked in the OctopusDeploy repository with issue number 5961.

In summary, CVE-2019-19085 is a persistent XSS vulnerability in Octopus Server where an authenticated user with the necessary permissions can upload a malicious file containing malicious web scripts, potentially leading to a wide range of attacks, such as session hijacking, data theft, and page manipulation, affecting all users who view the content.
