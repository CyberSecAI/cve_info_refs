Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19712:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability of back-end users to manipulate the details view URL to access pages and articles they are not authorized to view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control in the back end. The system fails to adequately verify a user's permissions before displaying content, allowing users to bypass intended access restrictions through URL manipulation.
- **Direct Object Reference:** It appears that the system directly uses identifiers from the URL to access content, without validating whether the user has the necessary privileges to view that specific content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation leads to the disclosure of sensitive information (pages and articles) that users were not meant to access. This could potentially expose confidential or unpublished data.
- **Circumvention of Access Restrictions:** Attackers can bypass the intended access control mechanisms, gaining unauthorized access to content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating the URL within the Contao back end to point to pages or articles that the user is not authorized to see. This manipulation could be done by manually editing the URL or using automated techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Back-End User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user with access to the back-end of the Contao CMS. They do not need to be an administrator or have elevated privileges, but some form of back-end access is required.
- **Knowledge of URL Structure:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of the URL structure used by the Contao back end in order to successfully manipulate it and gain access to unauthorized content.

**Affected Versions:**
The following versions of Contao are affected:
- Contao 4.0
- Contao 4.1
- Contao 4.2
- Contao 4.3
- Contao 4.4 up to 4.4.45
- Contao 4.5
- Contao 4.6
- Contao 4.7
- Contao 4.8 up to 4.8.5

**Suggested Solution:**
- Update to Contao 4.4.46 or 4.8.6. These versions contain the necessary patches to address the vulnerability.
