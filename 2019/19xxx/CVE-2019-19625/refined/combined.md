### @vmayoral **[vmayoral](/vmayoral)** commented [Dec 6, 2019](#issue-533862712)

Currently, sros2 defaults leak node-related information from which an attacker can obtain additional information about the ROS graph.

This issue was discussed during the [Security workshop at ROSCon 2019](https://ros-swg.github.io/ROSCon19_Security_Workshop/) (credit and thanks to [@mikaelarguedas](https://github.com/mikaelarguedas) for pointing out the fix). In addition and for compleness, the flaw has been captured at the following ticket within the Robot Vulnerability Database (RVD): [aliasrobotics/RVD#922](https://github.com/aliasrobotics/RVD/issues/922)

A reproduction of this bug with the latest ROS 2 (master, `foxy`) packages is illustrated in <https://asciinema.org/a/SSnSAMlOEoHfqhAuzC1R98STF>. The same issue has been confirmed for `dashing` and `eloquent`.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks [@vmayoral](https://github.com/vmayoral) for the follow-up. I tried the fix right after ROSCon and think the leaking was still happening :s so I held on PRing it.  Did you have a different experience in your testing ? |

| [@mikaelarguedas](https://github.com/mikaelarguedas) I believe the issue here is bigger than this simple fix. Refer to [#172](https://github.com/ros2/sros2/issues/172) for some further testing on our side and discussion.  In case it helps, we're using internally the following configuration file to reproduce the flaw: sros2 leak reproduction file ``` networks:   - network:     - driver: overlay     - name: net1     - encryption: false  containers:   - container:     - name: subject1     - modules:          - base: registry.gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/offensive/alurity/ros2/ros2:latest          - network: net1   - container:     - name: subject2     - modules:          - base: registry.gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/offensive/alurity/ros2/ros2:latest          - volume: registry.gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/offensive/alurity/deve_atom          - network: net1   - container:     - name: attacker     - modules:          - base: registry.gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/offensive/alurity/ros2/ros2:latest          - volume: registry.gitlab.com/aliasrobotics/offensive/alurity/reco_aztarna          - network: net1  flow:   - container:     - name: subject1     - window:         - name: unsecure         - commands:           - command: "source /opt/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash"           - command: "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0"           - command: "ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker"           - split: horizontal           - command: "source /opt/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash"           - command: "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0"           - command: "env | grep ROS"  # this shows there's no security enabled at this point               - select: unsecure   - container:     - name: subject2     - window:         - name: secure         - commands:           - command: "source /opt/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash"           - command: "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1"           - command: "env | grep ROS"  # this shows there's no security enabled at this point           - command: "ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker"           - command: "export ROS_SECURITY_ENABLE=true"           - command: "export ROS_SECURITY_STRATEGY=Enforce"           - command: "export ROS_SECURITY_ROOT_DIRECTORY=/opt/ros2_ws/keystore"           - command: "export ROS_SECURITY_LOOKUP_TYPE=MATCH_PREFIX"                               - command: "env | grep ROS"  # from this point on, there's security enabled           - command: "ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp talker"           - split: horizontal           - command: "source /opt/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash"           - command: "export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=1"           - command: "cd /opt/ros2_ws/"                     - command: "mkdir policy"           # generate a security policy based on our current graph           - command: "ros2 security generate_policy policy/my_policy.xml"           - command: "cat policy/my_policy.xml"           #  populated the keystore for all profiles           - command: "ros2 security generate_artifacts -k keystore -p policy/my_policy.xml -n /_ros2cli"           - command: "kill -9 $(pidof talker)"     - select: secure   - container:     - name: attacker     - window:         - name: attacker_window         - commands:           - command: "source /opt/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash"           - command: "aztarna -t ros2 -d 0 --daemon"            - split: horizontal           - command: "source /opt/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash"           - type: "aztarna -t ros2 -d 1 --daemon"               - select: attacker_window   - attach: subject2  ```   This enables our internal security toolbox to launch and configure automatically the robotic scenario with the attacker connected to the same network, etc. We should be releasing this toolbox soon and make it available for testing which should simplify debugging things like this one. It's nevertheless easily reproducible at this point.  [@mikaelarguedas](https://github.com/mikaelarguedas) shall we maybe consider accepting this simple fix and moving the discussion on this "deeper" issue to [#172](https://github.com/ros2/sros2/issues/172)? I've allocated some bandwidth next week to look at this more closely. |

| shall we maybe consider accepting this simple fix and moving the discussion on this "deeper" issue to [#172](https://github.com/ros2/sros2/issues/172)? I've allocated some bandwidth next week to look at this more closely.  My original thinking was that this may add significant overhead to using security, as it seems that each data payload would be encrypted once and then the global rtps frame will be encrypted again. It may also diminish the usefulness of exposing configuration options like [#135](https://github.com/ros2/sros2/pull/135) if the rtps frame gets encrypted anyway.  So I would prefer us to be sure this is needed by a tested/working solution to not leak node information rather than merging it based on a hunch I had that hasn't proven valid yet.  Happy to know you allocated time to look into it! Feel free to ping me if I can help |

| For completeness, reporting back in here from [#172 (comment)](https://github.com/ros2/sros2/issues/172#issuecomment-572444539).  Didn't manage to put time into this beyond locating the vulnerability and reporting it, This might change in the coming weeks. I hope so. |

```
cve: CVE-2019-19625
cwe: CWE-200 (Information Exposure)
description: We found that SROS 2, the tools to generate and distribute keys for ROS
  2 and use the underlying security plugins of DDS from ROS 2 leak node information
  due to a leaky default configuration as inidicated at https://github.com/ros2/sros2/blob/master/sros2/sros2/policy/defaults/dds/governance.xml#L13.
  This exposure was first raised in the Security Workshop of ROSCon 2019 (Nov. 2019).
  Further debugging the flaw indicates that there might be some additional underlying
  issues.
exploitation:
  description: A simple use of ros2cli allows to exploit this flaw. See https://asciinema.org/a/SSnSAMlOEoHfqhAuzC1R98STF

cve: CVE-2019-19625
cwe: CWE-200 (Information Exposure)
description: We found that SROS 2, the tools to generate and distribute keys for ROS
  2 and use the underlying security plugins of DDS from ROS 2 leak node information
  due to a leaky default configuration as inidicated at https://github.com/ros2/sros2/blob/master/sros2/sros2/policy/defaults/dds/governance.xml#L13.
  This exposure was first raised in the Security Workshop of ROSCon 2019 (Nov. 2019).
  Further debugging the flaw indicates that there might be some additional underlying
  issues.
exploitation:
  description: A simple use of ros2cli allows to exploit this flaw. See https://asciinema.org/a/SSnSAMlOEoHfqhAuzC1R98STF
