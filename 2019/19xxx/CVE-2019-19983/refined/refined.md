Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19983:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper capability checks in the `fastvelocity_min_files_callback` function within the Fast Velocity Minify plugin. While the function correctly used `is_admin()` to verify the request originated from an admin page, it failed to confirm if the request came from an authenticated administrative user with the necessary capabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Full Path Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the full web root path of the WordPress installation. This occurs when the "Enable FVM Debug Mode" option is activated, causing the full file path to be logged in the `$cachedir`. This path is then accessible via an AJAX request to the vulnerable callback.
*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The plugin incorrectly relies solely on `is_admin()` for authorization, which only checks if the request is from an administrative page, rather than verifying the user's administrative privileges and capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the full web root path, which is sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector for Further Exploitation:** The full path disclosure enables attackers to map the site's file structure for further attacks.
    *   This can aid directory traversal attacks to access restricted directories, potentially allowing command execution outside the WordPress web root.
    *   The disclosed path can help facilitate local file inclusion attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **AJAX Request:** The vulnerability is triggered via a `wp_ajax` request to the `fastvelocity_min_files_callback` function.
*   **Administrative Page:** An attacker must send the AJAX request from an administrative page to bypass the `is_admin()` check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have at least subscriber-level access to WordPress.
*   **"Enable FVM Debug Mode":** The "Enable FVM Debug Mode" option in the plugin must be enabled for the vulnerability to be exploitable.
*  **Knowledge of wp_ajax action**: The attacker needs to know the `wp_ajax` action that triggers the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity with a CVSS v3.0 score of 4.3.
*   The affected versions are <= 2.7.6 of the Fast Velocity Minify plugin.
*   The vulnerability is patched in version 2.7.7.
*   Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to protect against exploitation prior to the public patch.
*   The vulnerability is relatively easy to exploit since only subscriber or above level of privileges are needed.
