The provided content describes a Denial of Service vulnerability due to an integer overflow in the `MmsValue_newOctetString` function within the libiec61850 library.

- **Root Cause:** The `MmsValue_newOctetString` function doesn't validate if the `maxSize` argument is negative.
- **Vulnerability:** If a negative value is provided for `maxSize`, it's interpreted as a very large positive number during memory allocation (malloc).
- **Impact:** This leads to an attempt to allocate a huge chunk of memory, causing a denial-of-service condition. The allocation fails, and the program aborts.
- **Attack Vector:** By providing a crafted input with a negative `maxSize` value to the `MmsValue_newOctetString` function.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a negative value as input to the vulnerable function. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows how this can be triggered via a specially crafted MMS data structure.
