Based on the provided content, here's the information related to CVE-2019-19314:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Several sensitive tokens were being stored in plaintext within the GitLab application database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Plaintext storage of sensitive data:**  The application stored credentials like AWS keys, Akismet API key, reCAPTCHA keys, and Slack app secrets without encryption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the GitLab system (e.g., database access) could read these plaintext tokens. This could lead to further unauthorized access to the services associated with the exposed tokens (AWS, Slack, etc.)

**Attack vectors:**
- **Database access:**  An attacker with direct access to the GitLab application database (e.g., via SQL injection, compromised admin account, or direct system access) could extract these tokens using a simple SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the GitLab system and database is necessary for exploitation. This could be an administrator of the GitLab instance, or an attacker who has gained access to the GitLab system.
- Access to the system itself either physical or remote

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by user `xanbanx` via HackerOne.
- The affected versions were GitLab EE 8.4 and later.
- The fix involved encrypting these tokens.
- The vulnerability is also mentioned in the release notes for GitLab Security Release: 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7, indicating it was addressed in those versions.
