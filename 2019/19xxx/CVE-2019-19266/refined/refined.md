{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-19266",
  "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "affected_product": "IceWarp WebMail Server",
  "affected_versions": "12.2.0, 12.1.x, probably earlier as well",
  "fixed_versions": "12.2.1.1",
  "attack_vector": "An attacker with access to an IceWarp account can create/modify objects with malicious notes. When another user views the manipulated object (e.g., by opening their calendar), the XSS is triggered.",
  "root_cause": "The IceWarp WebMail Server is prone to cross-site scripting attacks in notes for objects because the filter for HTML entities and attributes in notes is only active when the content type of the note is set to “text/html”. When the content type is left out or set to any other type, the filter is not active, enabling attackers to circumvent the filter.",
  "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This could be used to display a fake login form and get access to the user’s credentials or to access any data stored in IceWarp such as emails, contacts, tasks, files, or appointments.",
  "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs access to an IceWarp account to create and share manipulated objects.",
  "attack_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the 'evnnote' parameter when creating or modifying appointments. By setting the 'evndescformat' to a value other than 'text/html' or omitting it, the XSS filter is bypassed.",
  "poc": "The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to create an appointment with a malicious note containing JavaScript code that will be executed when the appointment is viewed.",
