Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Pillow processes FPX images. If an FPX image reports a large number of bands, Pillow attempts to allocate excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** Pillow does not adequately limit the number of bands it attempts to process in an FPX image, leading to an excessive allocation of resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a denial of service, as the excessive resource consumption can cause the application or system to become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted FPX image file with an inflated number of bands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious FPX image to the Pillow library for processing. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - A website that allows users to upload images for processing.
    - An application that directly processes images from user input or external files.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-19911 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Pillow library that arises when processing malformed FPX image files. A crafted FPX image with a large number of reported bands can cause excessive resource allocation, rendering the system unresponsive.
