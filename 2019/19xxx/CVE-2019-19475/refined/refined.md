Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-19475:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insecure file permissions on the integrated PostgreSQL database within ManageEngine Applications Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper file permission security for the built-in PostgreSQL database.
- The vulnerability exists in ManageEngine Applications Manager 14 with Build 14360 and earlier builds.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: An authenticated user can modify the PostgreSQL configuration.
- Arbitrary command execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the system.
- Full system privilege: Successful exploitation can lead to gaining full system user access and rights.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Exploitation through the integrated PostgreSQL database.
- Attackers must be in the "Authenticated Users" group.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the ManageEngine Applications Manager.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure file permissions on the integrated PostgreSQL database that is included with ManageEngine Applications Manager. This allows authenticated users to escalate privileges by modifying the database's configuration. The vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users to achieve arbitrary command execution and gain full system privileges.
