The provided content discusses a fuzzing exercise performed on "Free Photo Viewer" and exploitation of a resulting crash. While the specific CVE isn't mentioned, the blog post details a process that could lead to discovering vulnerabilities. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

*   **Vulnerability:** SEH Overflow
*   **Root Cause:** The application Free Photo Viewer has a SEH overflow vulnerability when processing malformed BMP files. By providing a crafted BMP file, the SEH chain can be overwritten.
*   **Attack Vector:** Providing a malformed BMP file to the application.
*   **Exploitation:** Overwriting the SEH chain to redirect execution flow. The author uses a short shellcode (39 bytes) to call WinExec and execute calc.exe. This shellcode is placed within the BMP file. The exploit uses a POP POP RET instruction to jump to the shellcode.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution. In this case, the execution of calc.exe is demonstrated.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted BMP file to the application, likely by opening the malicious BMP.

The blog post provides more detail than a typical CVE description would. It includes:

*   The specific application targeted (Free Photo Viewer).
*   The file format used for exploitation (BMP).
*   The specific type of overflow (SEH).
*   A description of the shellcode used.
