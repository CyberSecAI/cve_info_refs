Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19058:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `alloc_sgtable()` function located in the `drivers/net/wireless/intel/iwlwifi/fw/dbg.c` file of the Linux kernel. This memory leak occurs when `alloc_page()` fails within this function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Memory leak:** The core issue is a failure to deallocate memory properly when the `alloc_page()` function fails within `alloc_sgtable()`, leading to a memory leak.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The repeated triggering of the memory leak can result in excessive memory consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

-   The attack vector is local and requires the attacker to trigger the failure of the alloc\_page function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   A local attacker with the ability to trigger the `alloc_page()` failure within the `alloc_sgtable()` function.  This is generally done by using a device or configuration that results in this specific kernel execution path that fails to allocate memory. 

**Additional information from the analyzed content:**

- Several sources indicate that the fix was included in kernel versions `5.3.12-300.fc31` for Fedora 31, `5.3.12-200.fc30` for Fedora 30, and a 25 March 2020 Ubuntu security update, amongst others.
- SUSE rates this vulnerability as "moderate," whereas the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) shows varying scores, but ultimately moderate severity.
- The SUSE vulnerability report contains CVSS v2 and v3 scores, while also mentioning a SUSE bugzilla entry related to the vulnerability: [1157145](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1157145)
- Some data suggests the vulnerability can be triggered when an attacker is able to cause an out-of-memory condition.
