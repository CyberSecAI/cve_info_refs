# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-1a3bdfde17
2020-01-20 22:48:10.259348
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 2.30
Release : 10.fc31
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update fixes a minor security vulnerability ([`LD\_PREFER\_MAP\_32BIT\_EXEC`
not ignored in setuid
binaries](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774682>) and addresses are
long-standing bug where missing shared objects could cause crashes due to
incorrectly handled `dlopen` failures (RHBZ#1395758). The latter fix also causes
lazy binding failures in ELF constructors and destructors to result in process
termination (the same effect that lazy binding failures have in other contexts),
rather than leaving the process in an inconsistent state. Furthermore, various
issues in the `utmp`/`utmpx` subsystem have been addressed. This update also
includes various minor fixes from the glibc 2.30 upstream stable release branch.

                 983479 989147 990542

This update fixes a wide range of vulnerabilities. A significant portion
affects character set conversion.

CVE-2016-10228

    The iconv program in the GNU C Library when invoked with multiple
    suffixes in the destination encoding (TRANSLATE or IGNORE) along with
    the -c option, enters an infinite loop when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences, leading to a denial of service.

CVE-2019-19126

    On the x86-64 architecture, the GNU C Library fails to ignore the
    LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC environment variable during program
    execution after a security transition, allowing local attackers to
    restrict the possible mapping addresses for loaded libraries and
    thus bypass ASLR for a setuid program.

CVE-2019-25013

    The iconv feature in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in the EUC-KR encoding, may have a buffer
    over-read.

CVE-2020-10029

    The GNU C Library could overflow an on-stack buffer during range
    reduction if an input to an 80-bit long double function contains a
    non-canonical bit pattern, a seen when passing a
    0x5d414141414141410000 value to sinl on x86 targets. This is related
    to sysdeps/ieee754/ldbl-96/e_rem_pio2l.c.

CVE-2020-1752

    A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc was found in the
    way the tilde expansion was carried out. Directory paths containing
    an initial tilde followed by a valid username were affected by this
    issue. A local attacker could exploit this flaw by creating a
    specially crafted path that, when processed by the glob function,
    would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2020-27618

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    multi-byte input sequences in IBM1364, IBM1371, IBM1388, IBM1390,
    and IBM1399 encodings, fails to advance the input state, which could
    lead to an infinite loop in applications, resulting in a denial of
    service, a different vulnerability from CVE-2016-10228.

CVE-2020-6096

    An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
    memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc. Calling memcpy() (on ARMv7
    targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a negative
    value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
    vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
    memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
    writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code
    execution.  Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for
    program execution to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault
    or crash should have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent
    execution and iterations of this code will be executed with this
    corrupted data.

CVE-2021-27645

    The nameserver caching daemon (nscd) in the GNU C Library, when
    processing a request for netgroup lookup, may crash due to a
    double-free, potentially resulting in degraded service or Denial of
    Service on the local system. This is related to netgroupcache.c.

CVE-2021-3326

    The iconv function in the GNU C Library, when processing invalid
    input sequences in the ISO-2022-JP-3 encoding, fails an assertion in
    the code path and aborts the program, potentially resulting in a
    denial of service.

CVE-2021-33574

    The mq_notify function in the GNU C Library has a use-after-free. It
    may use the notification thread attributes object (passed through
    its struct sigevent parameter) after it has been freed by the caller,
    leading to a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
    unspecified other impact.

CVE-2021-35942

    The wordexp function in the GNU C Library may crash or read arbitrary
    memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an
    untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of
    service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was
    used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

CVE-2021-3999

    An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to
    memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local
    attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd()
    in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute
    arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.

CVE-2022-23218

    The deprecated compatibility function svcunix_create in the sunrpc
    module of the GNU C Library copies its path argument on the stack
    without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application
    is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2022-23219

    The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module
    of the GNU C Library copies its hostname argument on the stack without
    validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow,
    potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is
    not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
2.28-10+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.

```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c1)  Florian Weimer    2016-11-16 21:06:07 UTC  ``` The crash happens while relocating a reference to the __ctype_toupper_loc symbol in /lib64/libglib-2.0.so, after a dlopen of /opt/openoffice4/program/../program/libfwk.so.  The crash does not happen if this DSO is opened by itself.  We end up here in elf/do-rel.h:      114 #ifdef RTLD_BOOTSTRAP     115       /* The dynamic linker always uses versioning.  */     116       assert (map->l_info[VERSYMIDX (DT_VERSYM)] != NULL);     117 #else     118       if (map->l_info[VERSYMIDX (DT_VERSYM)])     119 #endif     120         {     121           const ElfW(Half) *const version =     122             (const void *) D_PTR (map, l_info[VERSYMIDX (DT_VERSYM)]);     123      124           for (; r < end; ++r)     125             {     126 #if defined ELF_MACHINE_IRELATIVE && !defined RTLD_BOOTSTRAP     127               if (ELFW(R_TYPE) (r->r_info) == ELF_MACHINE_IRELATIVE)     128                 {     129                   if (r2 == NULL)     130                     r2 = r;     131                   end2 = r;     132                   continue;     133                 }     134 #endif     135      136               ElfW(Half) ndx = version[ELFW(R_SYM) (r->r_info)] & 0x7fff    136 ;     137               elf_machine_rel (map, r, &symtab[ELFW(R_SYM) (r->r_info)],     138                                &map->l_versions[ndx],     139                                (void *) (l_addr + r->r_offset), skip_ifu    139 nc);     140             }  At line 137, map->l_versions is NULL:  (gdb) print map->l_versions  $7 = (struct r_found_version *) 0x0  But this is clearly wrong because glib has symbol versioning information (both on disk and as indicated by map->l_info[VERSYMIDX (DT_VERSYM)], otherwise we would not have entered that conditional.  I'm not sure if _dl_check_map_versions has run at this point.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c2)  Florian Weimer    2016-11-17 11:24:07 UTC  ``` It's not a recent glibc change which causes this.  I went back to glibc 2.18, and it exhibits the same problem (still with the Fedora 24 system DSOs).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c3)  Carlos O'Donell    2016-11-17 16:24:18 UTC  ``` (In reply to Florian Weimer from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c1)) > But this is clearly wrong because glib has symbol versioning information > (both on disk and as indicated by map->l_info[VERSYMIDX (DT_VERSYM)], > otherwise we would not have entered that conditional.  I'm not sure if > _dl_check_map_versions has run at this point.  Debugging this code is exceedingly difficult because of the relocation restrictions in the early startup and in general -O2. My expectation is that gdb is simply wrong and that map->l_versions is not NULL.  The interesting part is the SIGSEGV. Any chance you can get a trimmed down reproducer? I'm looking at extending our tracer into dlopen to be able to take a bunch of DSOs and simulate a startup load sequence, just to debug these kinds of issues (cycles, constructor orders etc.).   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c4)  Stephan Bergmann    2016-11-17 16:49:37 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c3)) > The interesting part is the SIGSEGV.

I just assumed that it was build in a way generic enough to let it work on any contemporary distro.  Seeing it crash I just wanted to inform you about it, in case it was something obvious.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c5)  Florian Weimer    2016-11-17 17:04:51 UTC  ``` (In reply to Carlos O'Donell from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c3)) > (In reply to Florian Weimer from [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c1)) > > But this is clearly wrong because glib has symbol versioning information > > (both on disk and as indicated by map->l_info[VERSYMIDX (DT_VERSYM)], > > otherwise we would not have entered that conditional.

My expectation is that > gdb is simply wrong and that map->l_versions is not NULL.  No, I set a conditional breakpoint well before the SIGSEGV, and a _dl_printf reports:  elf_dynamic_do_Rela: NULL l_versions for: /lib64/libglib-2.0.so.0  Note that the crash happens after dlopen, not during the initial link, which means that GDB should be fairly reliable (if it works at all, but due to aggressive inlining, this is often not the case).   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c6)  Florian Weimer    2016-11-17 17:41:20 UTC  ``` LD_DEBUG=files with some additional _dl_printf calls gives this output:  __dlopen: /opt/openoffice4/program/libvclplug_gtk.so _dl_map_object: /opt/openoffice4/program/libvclplug_gtk.so       8466:       8466:     file=/opt/openoffice4/program/libvclplug_gtk.so [0];

Approximately 2 (two) weeks from now Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 24. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora  'version' of '24'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version' to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not able to fix it before Fedora 24 is end of life. If you would still like to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c9)  Florian Weimer    2017-07-27 11:03:07 UTC  ``` We are tracking this upstream.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c10)  Florian Weimer    2019-10-01 13:12:33 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1755176](show_bug.cgi?id=1755176) has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c11)  Carlos O'Donell    2019-10-08 13:57:52 UTC  ``` *** [Bug 1624941](show_bug.cgi?id=1624941 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - F29 glibc incompatible with WPS office") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1395758#c12)  Florian Weimer    2019-11-28 14:50:51 UTC  ``` The upstream fix has landed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c0)  Marcin Kościelnicki    2019-11-19 08:13:27 UTC  ``` The code using LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC is run before the code that removes security-sensitive variables from the environment, thus the latter is ineffective.  This means a local attacker can effectively weaken ASLR strength on setuid binaries. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c1)  Marcin Kościelnicki    2019-11-19 08:24:23 UTC  ``` Patch pending: <https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-11/msg00649.html> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c2)  Florian Weimer    2019-11-19 13:42:47 UTC  ``` I think we should treat this as a security vulnerability because it is quite a significant regression for a system built with PIE-by-default (and slightly older binutils). ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c3)  Florian Weimer    2019-11-20 16:43:46 UTC  ``` Introduced in glibc 2.23:  commit b9eb92ab05204df772eb4929eccd018637c9f3e9 Author: H.J. Lu <hjl.tools@gmail.com> Date:   Wed Oct 21 14:44:23 2015 -0700      Add Prefer_MAP_32BIT_EXEC to map executable pages with MAP_32BIT          According to Silvermont software optimization guide, for 64-bit     applications, branch prediction performance can be negatively impacted     when the target of a branch is more than 4GB away from the branch.  Add     the Prefer_MAP_32BIT_EXEC bit so that mmap will try to map executable     pages with MAP_32BIT first.  NB: MAP_32BIT will map to lower 2GB, not     lower 4GB, address.  Prefer_MAP_32BIT_EXEC reduces bits available for     address space layout randomization (ASLR), which is always disabled for     SUID programs and can only be enabled by setting environment variable,     LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c4)  Marcin Kościelnicki    2019-11-20 23:23:02 UTC  ``` Patch v2: <https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2019-11/msg00698.html> ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c5)  Sourceware Commits    2019-11-21 12:19:36 UTC  ``` The master branch has been updated by Florian Weimer <fw@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=d5dfad4326fc683c813df1e37bbf5cf920591c8e>  commit d5dfad4326fc683c813df1e37bbf5cf920591c8e Author: Marcin Kościelnicki <mwk@0x04.net> Date:   Thu Nov 21 00:20:15 2019 +0100      rtld: Check __libc_enable_secure before honoring LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC (CVE-2019-19126) [BZ #25204]          The problem was introduced in glibc 2.23, in commit     b9eb92ab05204df772eb4929eccd018637c9f3e9     ("Add Prefer_MAP_32BIT_EXEC to map executable pages with MAP_32BIT"). ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c6)  Florian Weimer    2019-11-21 12:26:38 UTC  ``` Fixed for glibc 2.31. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c7)  rschiron    2019-11-21 17:01:39 UTC  ``` I believe this should be treated as a security hardening the same as other similar issues with weak ASLR have been treated (e.g. [https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22852](show_bug.cgi?id=22852 "UNCONFIRMED - Thread stack and heap caches") , [https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c3](show_bug.cgi?id=22853#c3 "UNCONFIRMED - Heap address of pthread_create thread is aligned.") ).  I do see how this is easier to trigger and more common in setuid binaries than the other similar flaws, but it still requires another unrelated vulnerability to be of any use and ASLR is a post-exploitation mitigation. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=25204#c8)  Sourceware Commits    2019-11-22 12:28:35 UTC  ``` The release/2.30/master branch has been updated by Florian Weimer <fw@sourceware.org>:  <https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=glibc.git;h=37c90e117310728a4ad1eb998c0bbe7d79c4a398>  commit 37c90e117310728a4ad1eb998c0bbe7d79c4a398 Author: Marcin Kościelnicki <mwk@0x04.net> Date:   Thu Nov 21 00:20:15 2019 +0100      rtld: Check __libc_enable_secure before honoring LD_PREFER_MAP_32BIT_EXEC (CVE-2019-19126) [BZ #25204]          The problem was introduced in glibc 2.23, in commit     b9eb92ab05204df772eb4929eccd018637c9f3e9     ("Add Prefer_MAP_32BIT_EXEC to map executable pages with MAP_32BIT").

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-c32e4b271c
2020-02-06 01:02:41.743855
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : glibc
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 2.29
Release : 28.fc30
URL : <http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/>
Summary : The GNU libc libraries
Description :
The glibc package contains standard libraries which are used by
multiple programs on the system. In order to save disk space and
memory, as well as to make upgrading easier, common system code is
kept in one place and shared between programs. This particular package
contains the most important sets of shared libraries: the standard C
library and the standard math library. Without these two libraries, a
Linux system will not function.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

This update incorporates fixes from the upstream glibc 2.29 stable release
branch, including a fix for a minor security vulnerability
([`LD\_PREFER\_MAP\_32BIT\_EXEC` not ignored in setuid
binaries](<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1774682>)).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
