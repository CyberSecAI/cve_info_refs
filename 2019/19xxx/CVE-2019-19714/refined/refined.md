Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19714:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the ability to inject "insert tags" into the login module of Contao. These insert tags are then processed and replaced when the page is rendered, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insert Tag Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within the login module, allowing for the injection of arbitrary insert tags.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The ability to inject insert tags can allow an attacker to potentially:
    - Modify the login page output and behavior.
    - Redirect users to malicious sites or inject malicious code to be executed by the client.
    - Potentially access or exfiltrate information

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login module.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to insert malicious input into the login module, likely through a field that does not properly sanitize input before processing.

**Affected Versions:**
- Contao versions 4.8.4 and 4.8.5 are affected.

**Solution:**
- The suggested solution is to update to Contao version 4.8.6 or later, which contains the fix for this vulnerability.
