Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw within the server selection box on the login page of Wowza Streaming Engine Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  Reflected XSS: The application reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Code Execution: An attacker can inject malicious scripts that execute within the context of the victim's browser session. This allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions like session hijacking, defacement, or redirection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Embedded Script in URL field: The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Wowza Streaming Engine URL field within the login form.
- Failed Login: The injected script is executed when the user attempts to log in, and the login fails.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely by crafting a malicious URL.
- No authentication required: The vulnerability exists pre-authentication on the login page.
