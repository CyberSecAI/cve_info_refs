- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `load_sixel` function at `loader.c:629` when processing a specially crafted image file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability. The `load_sixel` function attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution. The provided ASAN log shows a crash due to the buffer overflow.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when loading a specially crafted image file using `img2sixel`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious image file to `img2sixel`. This could be done by convincing a user to process a crafted image or by an attacker gaining control of the input to `img2sixel`.
