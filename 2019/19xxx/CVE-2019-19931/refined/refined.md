The provided content describes a heap overflow vulnerability in the `MmsValue_decodeMmsData` function within the `libiec61850` library.

**Root Cause:**
- A heap buffer overflow occurs in `MmsValue_decodeMmsData` function at `mms/iso_mms/server/mms_access_result.c:238` when decoding MMS data.

**Vulnerabilities/Weaknesses:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow. The code allocates a buffer on the heap and then writes more data into it than it can hold.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The heap overflow could lead to a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application or by overwriting critical data structures, which could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution depending on the surrounding memory layout and exploitation techniques.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by supplying a crafted MMS data input to the vulnerable function `MmsValue_decodeMmsData`. This data is then parsed and processed by the vulnerable function, which causes the overflow due to incorrect buffer handling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to send crafted MMS data to the vulnerable `libiec61850` server in order to trigger the vulnerability. This implies that the attacker either needs to be on the network or be able to influence the data fed to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided information includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates how to trigger the heap overflow.
- The issue is located in the `mms_access_result.c` file, specifically at line 238 and is triggered during a `memcpy` operation.
- The crash occurs at `__asan_memcpy` due to AddressSanitizer detecting the heap buffer overflow.
- The PoC involves compiling the library with Address Sanitizer flags, compiling the test case, and then running the test case with the provided crafted input.
