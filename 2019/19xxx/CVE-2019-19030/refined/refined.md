Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-19030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper authentication checks on certain Harbor API endpoints. This allows unauthenticated users to make requests and receive different HTTP status codes based on whether the requested resource exists or not.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure/Enumeration:** The primary vulnerability is an enumeration issue. The application reveals information about the existence of projects, repositories, charts, and labels to unauthenticated users.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The API endpoints listed in the advisory do not require authentication, allowing anyone to access them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can discover the existence of projects, repositories, charts, tags, and labels without needing valid credentials. This information could be used for further attacks.
*   The impact is described as "low" severity, likely due to the lack of direct data breach or system compromise. However, the information obtained can facilitate other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the Harbor API. An attacker makes unauthenticated HTTP requests to specific endpoints.
*   The attacker can use tools to automate requests based on a wordlist or sequence of possible resource identifiers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any authentication.
*   The attacker needs to have network access to the Harbor instance to send the HTTP requests.
*   No special privileges are required, only network access to the Harbor API

**Affected API Endpoints:**

The following API endpoints were identified as vulnerable:
* /api/chartrepo/{repo}/prov (POST)
* /api/chartrepo/{repo}/charts (GET, POST)
* /api/chartrepo/{repo}/charts/{name} (GET, DELETE)
* /api/chartrepo/{repo}/charts/{name}/{version} (GET, DELETE)
* /api/labels?name={name}&scope=p (GET)
* /api/repositories?project\_id={id} (GET)
* /api/repositories/{repo\_name}/ (GET, PUT, DELETE)
* /api/repositories/{repo\_name}/tags (GET)
* /api/repositories/{repo\_name}/tags/{tag}/manifest?version={version} (GET)
* /api/repositories/{repo\_name/{tag}/labels (GET)
* /api/projects?project\_name={name} (HEAD)
* /api/projects/{project\_id}/summary (GET)
* /api/projects/{project\_id}/logs (GET)
* /api/projects/{project\_id} (GET, PUT, DELETE)
* /api/projects/{project\_id}/metadatas (GET, POST)
* /api/projects/{project\_id}/metadatas/{metadata\_name} (GET, PUT)

**Patched Versions:**
* 1.10.3
* 2.0.1

**Additional Notes**
