  "response": {
    "cve": "CVE-2019-19509",
    "is_relevant": true,
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is located in the `ajaxArchiveFiles.php` file where the `path` parameter is not properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code within the `path` parameter, which is then executed by the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server user (e.g., apache).",
    "attack_vector": "The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxArchiveFiles.php` with a malicious payload in the `path` parameter after authenticating to the web application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the rConfig web application. They need to send crafted HTTP requests to trigger the vulnerability."
