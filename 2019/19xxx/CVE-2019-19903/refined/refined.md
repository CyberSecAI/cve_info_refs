- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of output when displaying file type descriptions created by administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could craft a malicious file type description, which, when viewed by an administrator, would execute arbitrary scripts in the administrator's browser session. This could lead to account compromise or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with the "Administer file types" permission can create a malicious file type description. The exploit occurs when an administrator views the list of file types, causing the malicious script to execute.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user account with the "Administer file types" permission.
