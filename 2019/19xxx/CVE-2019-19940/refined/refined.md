Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-19940:

**Root Cause:**

- Incorrect input sanitization in text-oriented user interfaces (telnet, SSH) of Swisscom Centro Grande devices. Specifically, the command-line interface (CLISH) does not properly handle backslashes within quoted strings.

**Vulnerabilities:**

- **Command Injection:** Attackers can escape from quoted strings and inject arbitrary shell commands due to insufficient input validation in the CLISH.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows remote, authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands on the router as the `admin` user. This allows full control of the device, potentially impacting confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Access:** Attackers need local network access to reach the device.
- **Authentication:** Attackers must have valid SSH credentials to access the command-line interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- Must possess valid credentials to authenticate via SSH.
- Must be able to send crafted commands to the CLISH.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way the CLISH handles backslashes (`\`) within quoted strings. The CLISH uses a whitelist to define available commands, but the lack of proper sanitization allows an attacker to escape the string and inject commands.
- The provided example shows how to use the `tcpdump` command to execute a shell command: `tcpdump enable file filter br0 \ "; sh -c sh \"`
- The attacker can then get an unrestricted shell to execute arbitrary commands with `admin` privileges.

**Affected Devices:**

- Swisscom Centro Grande version 6.14.06 and below.
