- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic flaw in the Red Cloak agent's workflow. Specifically, a module responsible for logging events failed when it lacked write permissions to a directory, causing the entire telemetry process to halt, and preventing other modules from reporting/alerting.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The Red Cloak agent relied on a single logging module's success for the entire process to function. If that module failed due to permission issues, it bypassed the whole alerting system. Additionally, verbose logging was required to see the local logs that would indicate the bypass, which required a system restart to enable, and would not be on by default.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with local access could bypass the Red Cloak endpoint detection system by removing system permissions from a file or directory. This allowed the attacker to execute malicious tools, such as Mimikatz, without triggering alerts.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine running the Red Cloak agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to modify file/folder permissions on the local system.
