{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The CSRF cookie sometimes misses the `secure` attribute when Octopus is behind a load balancer with SSL offloading configured.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The lack of the `secure` attribute on the CSRF cookie when SSL offloading is configured can lead to the cookie being transmitted over insecure connections, potentially exposing the user to man-in-the-middle attacks.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially intercept the CSRF cookie transmitted over an insecure connection, which could allow them to perform actions on behalf of a legitimate user.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle attacks, intercepting the cookie transmitted over a non-HTTPS connection.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the Octopus server when the cookie is being transmitted over a non-HTTPS connection. This is more likely to occur in scenarios where the user is on a network that the attacker can control."
