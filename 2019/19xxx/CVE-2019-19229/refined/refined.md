## CVE-2019-19229

Based on the provided information, the content is related to CVE-2019-19229.

### Root Cause of Vulnerability
The root cause is an authenticated path traversal vulnerability.

### Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present
Authenticated users can perform path traversal attacks. The web server runs with "nobody" privileges, but nearly all files on the filesystem are world-readable and can be extracted.

### Impact of Exploitation
Exploitation allows attackers to gain access to the operating system of the device, access network configurations, connections to other hosts, and potentially other sensitive information.

### Attack Vectors
By sending a crafted request to the `/admincgi-bin/service.fcgi` endpoint.

### Required Attacker Capabilities/Position
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.

### Technical Details
The following request triggers the vulnerability:
```
GET /admincgi-bin/service.fcgi?action=download&filename=../../../../../etc/shadow
```
This allows reading arbitrary files, such as `/etc/shadow`.
