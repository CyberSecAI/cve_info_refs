{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Enabling the RabbitMQ manager in the Ansible Tower installer exposes the management interface publicly.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The RabbitMQ management interface is exposed publicly, and the default 'guest' user with a guessable password might still be active.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could guess the default admin password and gain access to the system.",
  "Attack vectors": "Network access to the exposed RabbitMQ management interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to access the exposed RabbitMQ management interface and have the ability to attempt to log in with the default 'guest' credentials."
