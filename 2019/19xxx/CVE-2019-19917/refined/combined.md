## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 33 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [BINUTILS235](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS235 "Changes/BINUTILS235")
* [CMake to do out-of-source builds](/wiki/Changes/CMake_to_do_out-of-source_builds "Changes/CMake to do out-of-source builds")
* [Aarch64 PointerAuthentication](/wiki/Changes/Aarch64_PointerAuthentication "Changes/Aarch64 PointerAuthentication")
* [Java11](/wiki/Changes/Java11 "Changes/Java11")
* [Sqlite Rpmdb](/wiki/Changes/Sqlite_Rpmdb "Changes/Sqlite Rpmdb")
* [RPM 4.16](/wiki/Changes/RPM-4.16 "Changes/RPM-4.16")
* [F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate](/wiki/Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate "Changes/F33MingwEnvToolchainUpdate")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 22nd. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f33
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f33. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f33 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f33
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a golang build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2020-07-27 10:00:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-88fb82d1cd
2020-10-31 02:01:36.973833
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : lout
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 3.40
Release : 18.fc31
URL : <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lout/>
Summary : A document formatting system
Description :
Lout is a document formatting system designed and implemented by Jeffrey
Kingston at the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of
Sydney, Australia. The system reads a high-level description of a document
similar in style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript file which can be
printed on most laser printers and graphic display devices. Plain text
output is also available, PDF output is limited but working (e.g. no
graphics). Lout is inherently multilingual. Adding new languages is easy.

| The attached patch should fix both of the CVEs. The one in StringQuotedWord was more complicated because it was due to a string longer than MAX\_BUFF, and when I fixed the access there, other places had errors. The one in srcnext needed only an extra test in a loop. I tested the manual in doc/user before and after, and the only differences seemed to be places that embedded the current time.

If don't know if github is a good idea since it can frament a lot but it needs a maintainer/shared git account so it doesn't get lost.  Its sad to see linux distro's already dumping it.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2020-869cd99560
2020-10-31 02:01:12.817930
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : lout
Product : Fedora 32
Version : 3.40
Release : 18.fc32
URL : <http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lout/>
Summary : A document formatting system
Description :
Lout is a document formatting system designed and implemented by Jeffrey
Kingston at the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of
Sydney, Australia. The system reads a high-level description of a document
similar in style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript file which can be
printed on most laser printers and graphic display devices. Plain text
output is also available, PDF output is limited but working (e.g. no
graphics). Lout is inherently multilingual. Adding new languages is easy.

Version : 3.40
Release : 18.fc33

Summary : A document formatting system
Description :
Lout is a document formatting system designed and implemented by Jeffrey
Kingston at the Basser Department of Computer Science, University of
Sydney, Australia. The system reads a high-level description of a document
similar in style to LaTeX and produces a PostScript file which can be
printed on most laser printers and graphic display devices. Plain text
output is also available, PDF output is limited but working (e.g. no
graphics). Lout is inherently multilingual. Adding new languages is easy.

## Buffer overflow in the StringQuotedWord() function

Hi,

While fuzzing lout 3.40 with Honggfuzz, I found a buffer overflow in
the StringQuotedWord() function, in z39.c.

Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so it doesn't get mangled).

Issue can be reproduced by running:

```
lout test02
```

```
