Package        : imagemagick
Version        : 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u19
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-19948 CVE-2019-19949
Debian Bug     : 947309 947308

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in imagemagick, an image processing
toolkit.

CVE-2019-19948

    Heap-buffer-overflow in WriteSGIImage (coders/sgi.c) caused by insufficient
    validation of row and column sizes. This vulnerability might be leveraged by
    remote attackers to cause denial of service or any other unspecified impact
    via crafted image data.

CVE-2019-19949

    Heap-based buffer over-read (off-by-one) in WritePNGImage (coders/png.c)
    caused by missing length check prior pointer dereference. This vulnerability
    might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of service via
    crafted image data.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u19.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Imagemagick: Various memory
handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitising
may result in denial of service, memory disclosure or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed image files are processed.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.9.10.23+dfsg-2.1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

For the detailed security status of imagemagick please refer to
its security tracker page at:

Package        : imagemagick
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-13300 CVE-2019-13304 CVE-2019-13306 CVE-2019-13307
                 CVE-2019-15140 CVE-2019-19948

This update fixes multiple vulnerabilities in Imagemagick: Various memory
handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitising
may result in denial of service, memory disclosure or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed image files are processed.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-11+deb9u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.

For the detailed security status of imagemagick please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/imagemagick>
