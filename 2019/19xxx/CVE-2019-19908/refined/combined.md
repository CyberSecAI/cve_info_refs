# [CVE-2019-19908](https://cinzinga.com/CVE-2019-19908/)

2 minute read

Recently [x00pwn](https://github.com/FULLSHADE), a few others from the [InfoSec-Prep Discord server](https://discord.gg/TyZpfAs), and myself have been participating in a challenge we dubbed “The 12 Days of CVE-mas.” The premise of the challenge is to use the free time we have this holiday season to discover and develop as many exploits as possible, in the hopes of obtaining CVE(s).

Up until this point we had found quite a few local denial of service exploits as well as SEH overwrites, but few of them were worth developing or reporting.

* [FTP Navigator 8.03 – ‘Custom Command’ Denial of Service (SEH)](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47794)
* [SurfOffline Professional Local SEH Overflow](https://github.com/FULLSHADE/POPPOPRET-nullbyte-DLL-bypass)

Additionally, local buffer overflows and DoS exploits rarely get assigned CVEs as they must be performed locally.

## phpMyChat-Plus 1.98

Today, as I was going through the list of programs we had identified for fuzzing, I came across [phpMyChat-Plus 1.98](https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmychat/). I became interested as I saw it was a recently maintained program (with the most recent version having been released 2 weeks ago) and it also utilized a backend database of MySQL.

Installing the app locally, I began setting it up and before I had completed the installation I discovered the first vulnerability.

![](/assets/images/Exploit-Dev/phpMyChat/1.png)

It is one of x00pwn’s philosophies that in applications where one vulnerability exists, many more often exist. Thus, I knew if I kept digging post-installation, I would be sure to find more.

Unbeknownst to me at this time, this application has a [history of vulnerabilities](https://www.exploit-db.com/search?q=phpmychat+plus), but luckily none overlap with my next discovery.

Quite by accident I messed up the installation; as I attempted to reset the admin account password, I noticed that the username one entered to reset was also present in the URL. It is often an indicator of reflected XSS when a URL parameter changes what is displayed on the page.

## Steps to Obtain Reflected XSS

Starting URL:

`http://localhost/plus/pass_reset.php?L=english&pmc_username=admin&LIMIT=1`

Visiting this page displays ‘admin’ in the username field.

Payload:

`"><script>alert(1)</script>`

Looking through the page’s source code, I saw it was necessary to close the current tags to escape the username field. This is done with the `">` part of the payload; now we are free to inject JavaScript code.

Payload + URL:

`http://localhost/plus/pass_reset.php?L=english&pmc_username="><script>alert(1)</script>`

Putting the two parts together we get this.

![](/assets/images/Exploit-Dev/phpMyChat/2.png)

*Figure 2: pass\_reset.php parameter ‘pmc\_username=’ vulnerable to reflected XSS*

Since this XSS can be achieved without authentication, and I was eager to obtain my first CVE, I decided to report this vulnerability to both the developer and MITRE.

My experience with MITRE was very pleasant and I included a link to a real-world website running this program with the payload so they could confirm its presence. Within just 1 hour I was assigned [CVE-2019-19908](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19908).

![](/assets/images/Exploit-Dev/phpMyChat/3.png)

*Speedy response time*

While this is not a groundbreaking discovery, I am certainly proud as it is my first CVE.

The Exploit-DB submission is currently pending.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
