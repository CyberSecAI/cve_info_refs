  "vulnerability": {
    "cveID": "CVE-2019-19334",
    "description": "libyang: stack-based buffer overflow in make_canonical when identityref leaf type is used",
    "affectedComponent": "libyang",
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by an insecure use of strcpy/sprintf in the make_canonical function when processing 'identityref' types, without proper bounds checking. Specifically, when the identityref leaf type has a default value longer than 511 bytes, a stack-based buffer overflow occurs due to the lack of length validation before copying data into a fixed-size buffer.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit can lead to a denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Parsing a specially crafted YANG file containing a long default value for an identityref leaf type."
    ],
    "attackerRequirements": [
      "The attacker needs to provide a malicious YANG file with a long default value for the 'identityref' leaf type. The target application needs to use libyang to parse this file.",
      "No authentication is required."
    ],
    "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability occurs in the make_canonical() function within the parser.c file. The fix involves adding a length check before calling strcpy/sprintf. The affected versions of libyang are up to version 1 release 4. The specific code change for the fix can be found at https://github.com/CESNET/libyang/commit/6980afae2ff9fcd6d67508b0a3f694d75fd059d6."
