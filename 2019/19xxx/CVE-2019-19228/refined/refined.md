{
  "CVE-2019-19228": {
    "Root cause": "The web interface has a backdoor user account with the username \"today\".",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Backdoor account with hardcoded username.",
      "The password for the \"today\" account changes daily based on a device-specific string and the system time.",
      "Passwords for all users of the web interface are stored in plain text in the `/tmp/web_users.conf` file."
    ],
    "Impact": "The \"today\" account has all permissions of all other users (\"service\", \"admin\", and \"user\") combined. This could lead to full control over the device if the password for this account is compromised.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the web interface is required.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs network access to the device and must be able to reach the web interface.  An attacker would also need to reverse engineer the password generation algorithm to predict the daily password for the 'today' user."
  }
