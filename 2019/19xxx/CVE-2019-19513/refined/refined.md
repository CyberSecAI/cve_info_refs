Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19513:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `BASS_MIDI.DLL` library when parsing the deltatime of a MIDI TrackChunk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect boundary check during the parsing of MIDI files, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- Specifically, the code at `bass_midi+0xab4c` attempts to write a byte to memory using a calculated offset. If the offset value is crafted maliciously, the write operation can occur beyond the intended buffer, corrupting memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially achieve code execution by grooming the heap and using the out-of-bounds write to overwrite sensitive data or pointers.
- The vulnerability could also lead to application crashes or other unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted MIDI file.
- This MIDI file can be loaded either by streaming or local execution.
- Any application using `bass_midi.dll` to parse the malicious MIDI file is vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to create a malicious MIDI file with a crafted deltatime that triggers the out-of-bounds write.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious MIDI file to the victim. This can be through various means including, but not limited to, email attachments, compromised websites, etc.
- The attacker does not need any elevated privileges; the vulnerability can be exploited when the victim uses the vulnerable `bass_midi.dll` to parse the crafted MIDI.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is `BASS_MIDI.DLL` versions `2.4.12.1` and below.
- The affected software is used in various media players such as AIMP, MusicBee etc.
- The out-of-bounds write occurs at offset `bass_midi+0xab4c` within the `bass_midi.dll`.
- The vulnerable instruction is `mov byte ptr [eax+esi+6DCh],bl`.
- The offset `eax` can be controlled by a byte in the midi file, enabling an attacker to write about `0x76` bytes out of bounds.
