- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Sending specially crafted SNMP packets to port 161/udp causes a crash in the SNMP service of affected devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service. The SNMP service crashes and requires a manual restart of the device to resume operation.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access to port 161/udp. An unauthenticated attacker can send crafted SNMP packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated attacker with network access to the affected device on port 161/udp.
