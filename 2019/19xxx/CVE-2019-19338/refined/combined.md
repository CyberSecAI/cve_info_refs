Subject: CVE-2019-19338 Kernel: KVM: export MSR_IA32_TSX_CTRL to guest -
 incomplete fix for TAA (CVE-2019-11135)

   Hello,

Transaction Asynchronous Abort (TAA) h/w issue, which affects Intel CPUs, is
mitigated in two ways. One is by disabling Transactional Synchronisation
Extensions (TSX) feature of the CPU. And second is by clearing the affected
Store/Fill/Load port architectural buffers, which may hold sensitive
information bits.

It was found that the current kernel fixes don't completely fix TAA issue for
guest VMs. When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by TAA (ie.
TAA_NO=0) but not affected by MDS issue (ie MDS_NO=1), to mitigate TAA issue,
guest was to clear the affected buffers by using VERW instruction mechanism.
But when MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, it did not quite use the
VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers.

This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs, which are affected by
the TAA (ie. TAA_NO=0) issue, but are not affected by the MDS (ie. MDS_NO=1)
issue.

It requires that host has 'TSX' enabled.

Upstream patches:
-----------------
   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/cbbaa2727aa3ae9e0a844803da7cef7fd3b94f2b>
   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/c11f83e0626bdc2b6c550fc8b9b6eeefbd8cefaa>
   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/b07a5c53d42a8c87b208614129e947dd2338ff9c>

Another option: Export MDS_NO=0 to guests when TSX is enabled
   -> <https://git.kernel.org/linus/e1d38b63acd843cfdd4222bf19a26700fd5c699e>

'CVE-2019-19338' is assigned by Red Hat Inc.

Thank you.

When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by the TAA flaw (TAA\_NO=0), but is not affected by the MDS issue (MDS\_NO=1), the guest was to clear the affected buffers by using a VERW instruction mechanism. But when the MDS\_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, the guests did not use the VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers. This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs and requires that host has 'TSX' enabled. Confidentiality of data is the highest threat associated with this vulnerability. | | | Clone Of: |  | | | Environment: |  | | | Last Closed: | 2020-02-04 14:10:05 UTC | | | Embargoed: |  | | |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1781514#c0)  Prasad Pandit    2019-12-10 07:54:32 UTC  ``` Transaction Asynchronous Abort (TAA) h/w issue, which affects Intel CPUs, is mitigated in two ways. One is by disabling Transactional Synchronisation Extensions (TSX) feature of the CPU. And second is by clearing the affected Store/Fill/Load port architectural buffers, which may hold sensitive information bits.  It was found that the current kernel fixes don't completely fix TAA issue for the guest VMs. When a guest is running on a host CPU affected by TAA flaw (ie. TAA_NO=0) but not affected by MDS issue (ie MDS_NO=1), to mitigate TAA issue, guest was to clear the affected buffers by using VERW instruction mechanism. But when MDS_NO=1 bit was exported to the guests, guest did not quite use the VERW mechanism to clear the affected buffers.  This issue affects guests running on Cascade Lake CPUs, which are affected by the TAA (ie. TAA_NO=0) issue, but are not affected by the MDS (ie. MDS_NO=1) issue.  It requires that host has 'TSX' enabled.

# blists - web interface to mailing list archives

blists is a web interface to mailing list archives that works off indexed mbox files.
There are two programs: *bindex* and *bit*.
*bindex* generates or updates the index file (yes, incremental updates are supported).
*bit* is a CGI/SSI program that generates web pages on the fly.
Both programs are written in C and are very fast.

You can view the latest <README> file,
which describes blists in more detail and provides installation instructions.
It is also included in the archive below.

Download ([release notes](/lists/announce/2017/11/19/1)):

* [blists 2.0](blists-2.0.tar.gz) and
  its [signature](blists-2.0.tar.gz.sign)* [blists 1.0](blists-1.0.tar.gz) and
    its [signature](blists-1.0.tar.gz.sign)

These files are also
[available from the Openwall file archive](https://download.openwall.net/pub/projects/blists/).
The source code of blists can be browsed on
[GitHub](https://github.com/openwall/blists) or via
[CVSweb](https://cvsweb.openwall.com/blists).

Follow [this link](/signatures/) for information on verifying the signatures.

To see blists in action, check out our
[Open Source and information security mailing list archives](https://lists.openwall.net).

blists is a registered project with
[Open Hub](https://www.openhub.net/p/blists).

kvm/x86: Export MDS\_NO=0 to guests when TSX is enabledExport the IA32\_ARCH\_CAPABILITIES MSR bit MDS\_NO=0 to guests on TSX
Async Abort(TAA) affected hosts that have TSX enabled and updated
microcode. This is required so that the guests don't complain,
"Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode"
when the host has the updated microcode to clear CPU buffers.
Microcode update also adds support for MSR\_IA32\_TSX\_CTRL which is
enumerated by the ARCH\_CAP\_TSX\_CTRL bit in IA32\_ARCH\_CAPABILITIES MSR.
Guests can't do this check themselves when the ARCH\_CAP\_TSX\_CTRL bit is
not exported to the guests.
In this case export MDS\_NO=0 to the guests. When guests have
CPUID.MD\_CLEAR=1, they deploy MDS mitigation which also mitigates TAA.
