## Analysis of CVE-2019-19810

The provided content relates to **CVE-2019-19810**, a Java RMI deserialization vulnerability in Zoom Call Recording 6.3.1.

### Root Cause:

The root cause is the Java RMI service in Zoom Call Recording 6.3.1 deserializing untrusted data.

### Weakness:

The vulnerability lies in the insecure deserialization of Java objects received through the RMI service. While the RMI service was supposedly protected by JEP 290, it could be bypassed.

### Impact:

A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution on the target host.

### Attack Vectors:

The following attack vectors are available:

*   **Direct Object Insertion into Function Arguments:** Exploiting remote methods that accept arbitrary objects (or variants like object arrays) as arguments to directly inject malicious objects.
*   **"Bypassing" Argument Type Safety:** A more complex attack that can be used on any remote method that takes at least one argument.

### Attacker Capabilities:

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can be remote.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target host to send crafted RMI requests.
