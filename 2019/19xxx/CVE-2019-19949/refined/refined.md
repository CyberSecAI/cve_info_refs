{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A heap-based buffer over-read exists in the `WritePNGImage` function within `coders/png.c` due to a missing length check prior to a pointer dereference.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap-based buffer over-read",
      "Missing length check"
     ],
    "impact": "Denial of service and potentially other unspecified impact. An attacker can cause a crash by exploiting this vulnerability with crafted image data.",
    "attack_vector": "Processing a specially crafted image file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a crafted image file.",
	"more_details": "The vulnerability is related to `Magick_png_write_raw_profile` and `LocaleNCompare`. The over-read occurs when processing PNG image profiles. The issue is triggered when converting a malformed image to PNG format. The vulnerability can be triggered remotely by an attacker who can supply a crafted image file to an application that uses ImageMagick."
