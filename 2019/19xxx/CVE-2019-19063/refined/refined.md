Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19063:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a memory leak in the `rtl_usb_probe()` function within the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver. The driver does not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory Leak: The vulnerability is specifically characterized by a failure to deallocate memory under certain error conditions within the `rtl_usb_probe()` function of the `rtlwifi/usb.c` driver in the Linux kernel. 
- Improper resource handling: The driver doesn't release resources correctly when an error occurs during device probing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): A local attacker can trigger the memory leak repeatedly, leading to excessive memory consumption and eventually causing a denial of service. The system may become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: An attacker needs local access to the system.
- Trigger specific error conditions: The attacker needs to induce specific error conditions during the device probe process of the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver. This typically involves the insertion of a device that the driver attempts to probe but fails.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local Access: The attacker must be able to execute code on the target system, which implies a local user account.
- Ability to load or interact with the rtlwifi USB driver.

**Additional notes**

- The vulnerability is specifically within the Realtek rtlwifi USB driver.
- Multiple sources confirm the issue is a memory leak due to improper deallocation in error conditions.
- The severity is generally considered moderate as it requires local access and a specific sequence of events to trigger. However, the impact can still be denial of service.
- Some sources dispute the severity due to the limited attack vector.
- Mitigation includes blacklisting the kernel module `rtl8192cu`.
