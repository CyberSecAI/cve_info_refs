{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-19519",
  "description": "A local attacker can exploit su's -L option (\"Loop until a correct username and password combination is entered\") to log in as themselves but with another user's login class (with the exception of root's login class if the attacker is not in the group \"wheel\"), because the class variable is set once and never reset.",
  "affected_components": [
    "su"
  ],
  "root_cause": "The `su` utility with the `-L` option does not reset the login class variable after a failed login attempt, allowing a user to log in with a login class different from their own.",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    "Improperly handled login class variable in `su` when using the `-L` option."
  ],
  "impact": "A local attacker can elevate their resource limits by logging in with another user's login class, potentially leading to resource exhaustion or denial of service. For example, an attacker could get higher process limits.",
  "attack_vector": "Local access to a vulnerable OpenBSD system is required.",
  "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system and the ability to execute the `su` command. The attacker does not need to be root or have any special privileges, but if they want to use root's login class they have to be in the wheel group."
