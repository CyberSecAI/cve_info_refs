{
  "CVE-2019-19645": {
    "Description": "alter.c in SQLite through 3.30.1 allows attackers to trigger infinite recursion via certain types of self-referential views in conjunction with ALTER TABLE statements.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the `alter.c` code within SQLite that mishandles self-referential views during ALTER TABLE operations.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Infinite recursion due to improper handling of self-referential views during ALTER TABLE statements."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to infinite recursion, potentially crashing the application using the vulnerable SQLite library.",
    "Attack vectors": "Attackers can exploit this flaw by crafting specific self-referential views and then executing ALTER TABLE statements on a table related to those views.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to create views and execute SQL queries including ALTER TABLE statements within the vulnerable SQLite database context. This might require local or authenticated access."
