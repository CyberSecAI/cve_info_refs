Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-19843:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of access control in the Ruckus access point's web interface, specifically related to symbolic links. A symbolic link at `/web/user/wps_tool_cache` points to `/tmp`.
* The `/tmp` directory contains a file `/var/run/rpmkey` that stores the device's admin credentials in plaintext (specifically, `all_powerful_login_name` and `all_powerful_login_password`).
* The webserver configuration allows for fetching any file from the `/web` directory, regardless of extension, meaning symbolic links are also accessible without restrictions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Plaintext admin credentials were being stored in a file accessible through a web-accessible symbolic link.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The webserver allows for arbitrary file access from `/web`, including traversal via symbolic links.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Credentials Disclosure:** An attacker can obtain the device's admin username and password.
*   **Potential for full device compromise:**  The disclosed credentials allow the attacker to log into the device via the web interface or SSH, leading to further exploitation using other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Request:** By crafting an HTTP request to fetch the `rpmkey` file through the `/web/user/wps_tool_cache` symbolic link, an attacker can obtain the credentials.
* **Network:** Attackers would need network access to the device web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web interface of the Ruckus access point.
*   **No prior authentication is required:** This vulnerability is exploitable pre-authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content also describes two other attack scenarios:
    *   **Stack overflow in `zap` executable:**  This was exploited through a crafted HTTP request, leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Arbitrary file write and command injection:** This was achieved by exploiting the `zap` executable to write a malicious `jsp` page and then using a command injection vulnerability.
*   The affected devices include Ruckus indoor and outdoor APs running firmware version 200.7.10.102.64 and below, and ZoneDirector 1200 (10.1.1.0.55).
*   The research was conducted using a dockerized QEMU full system emulation environment, demonstrating the feasibility of emulation for embedded device vulnerability research.
*   This vulnerability is part of a larger set of vulnerabilities discovered in Ruckus access points.
*   The researcher used Ghidra to analyze the firmware and identify the vulnerabilities.
