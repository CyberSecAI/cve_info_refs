Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-19074:

**CVE Description:** A memory leak in the `ath9k_wmi_cmd()` function in `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath9k/wmi.c` in the Linux kernel through 5.3.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).

**Root Cause:**
- The `ath9k_wmi_cmd()` function in the ath9k driver doesn't properly release the allocated network buffer (`skb`) when a timeout occurs while waiting for a WMI command to complete.

**Vulnerability:**
- Memory Leak: The failure to release the network buffer results in a memory leak.

**Impact:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By repeatedly triggering this memory leak, an attacker can consume available memory, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vector:**
- Local attacker with permissions to issue wifi device access control.

**Affected Systems:**
- Linux kernel versions through 5.3.11 (likely earlier versions as well)
