  "CVE-2019-19199": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The REDDOXX MailDepot email archiving solution has an insufficient session expiration vulnerability. After using the logout function, the assigned authentication token for the REST web service can still be used for many hours because it is only invalidated on the client and not on the server side.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The server-side does not invalidate authentication tokens upon user logout.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient Session Expiration (CWE-613)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could reuse a captured authentication token after a user logs out to access the REST web service.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could intercept and store a valid authentication token.  Then, after the legitimate user logs out, the attacker could reuse the token to access the service.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to intercept network traffic to obtain a valid authentication token. This could be achieved through network sniffing/MITM techniques."
