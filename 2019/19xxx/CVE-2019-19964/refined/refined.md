- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing function level access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is a missing function level access control issue. This means that the system does not properly restrict access to certain functions based on the user's role or permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact is rated as low, with only limited access to sensitive information (C:L), no change to information integrity (I:N), and no impact on availability (A:N).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) on the system. User interaction is not required (UI:N).
