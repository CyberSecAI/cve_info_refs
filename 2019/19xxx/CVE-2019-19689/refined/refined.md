- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is related to a weakness in the packer used by Trend Micro HouseCall for Home Networks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** DLL Hijacking vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by hijacking the DLL loading process.
- **Attack vectors:** By placing a malicious DLL that will be loaded instead of the legitimate one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to place a malicious DLL file on the system where Trend Micro HouseCall is installed, likely in a location where the application attempts to load libraries from.
