Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-19255:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A logic error allowed "Todos" to be created for former project members, even after they were removed from the project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inconsistent access control related to "Todos" creation and user removal.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Former project members could receive notifications (Todos) related to project activity they should no longer be privy to, potentially exposing sensitive project information or generating confusion.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the normal GitLab user interface and backend processes that handle project membership changes and TODO creation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have been a former member of the project and was removed from it. This is not a traditional "attacker" but a former user.
- The user is not required to have any special capabilities beyond being a user of the system, and having their membership to the project revoked.
