Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19294:

**CVE-2019-19294**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface of the Control Center Server (CCS) contains multiple stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in several input fields.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS). The web application fails to sanitize user-supplied input, allowing injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An authenticated remote attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the CCS web application. This code is then executed in the browser context of any other user who views the relevant CCS web content. This could lead to:
    *   Stealing sensitive information (session cookies, user data).
    *   Performing unauthorized actions within the CCS application on behalf of the victim user.
    *   Defacing the web interface.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through input fields in the CCS web interface.
    *   When another user accesses the page containing the injected script, their browser executes the code.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must have valid credentials and be authenticated to the CCS web interface.
    *   The attacker needs to identify input fields that are vulnerable to XSS.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Control Center Server (CCS), which is a central component in PKE management solutions, such as SiNVR/SiVMS.
*   The advisory mentions that PKE has released an update that fixes this issue (except for CVE-2019-18340), and encourages users to contact PKE for details.
*   Siemens recommends disabling the web interface of the CCS if it's not needed, or restricting access to localhost or trusted hosts only, and enabling TLS for the web interface as mitigation.
*   The vulnerability was originally reported in earlier advisories (SSA-761617 and SSA-844761) along with other vulnerabilities, and was later separated into its own advisory (SSA-761844).

The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.3 with the vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:U/RC:C
