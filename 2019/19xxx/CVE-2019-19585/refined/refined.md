  {
    "Verified": true,
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2019-19585",
    "Root cause": "The rConfig installation script improperly configures sudoers, granting the 'apache' user NOPASSWD access to several commands, including crontab, zip, chmod, chown, whoami, wc, tail, and rm.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper privilege management",
      "Overly permissive sudoers configuration"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with web RCE or Apache shell access can escalate privileges to root.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Web application compromise leading to RCE",
      "Exploiting sudo permissions granted to the 'apache' user"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker requires a web shell or RCE vulnerability to gain initial access to the server as the apache user, which is usually achieved through a separate vulnerability (e.g. CVE-2019-19509 mentioned in the exploit)."
