Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-19077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A memory leak exists in the `bnxt_re_create_srq()` function within the `drivers/infiniband/hw/bnxt_re/ib_verbs.c` file of the Linux kernel. This leak occurs when `ib_copy_to_udata()` fails during SRQ (Shared Receive Queue) creation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Leak:** The primary weakness is a memory leak. When `ib_copy_to_udata()` fails, the function's control flow jumps to `fail`, but it does not correctly free allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By repeatedly triggering the error condition (i.e., causing `ib_copy_to_udata()` to fail), an attacker can exhaust available kernel memory, leading to a denial of service. This is further clarified in the openSUSE and Ubuntu security notices as causing 'kernel memory exhaustion' and affecting system availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered within the infiniband subsystem, specifically the Broadcom NetXtreme RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) driver (`bnxt_re`).
- The attack involves manipulating the parameters during SRQ creation in a way to cause `ib_copy_to_udata()` to fail, forcing the kernel to leak memory.
-  The SUSE information suggests a local attack vector with low complexity while the National Vulnerability Database suggests the attack can occur over a network, though requires low privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence or control the RDMA operations to create SRQs, and in a way that causes the `ib_copy_to_udata()` function to fail. This is further clarified as 'local attacker' in the Ubuntu and SUSE advisories.
- The SUSE information rates the attack as low complexity while the National Vulnerability Database rate the attack as low to medium complexity, so a degree of skill in manipulating SRQ creation parameters might be needed.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix for this issue involves ensuring that allocated memory is properly released when `ib_copy_to_udata()` fails, adding `goto exit` before the `fail:` label in the code to free the allocated memory before jumping to the `fail` label.
- The Ubuntu notice specifically states "A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion)", indicating the attack vector is local.
- This vulnerability is present in Linux kernel versions through 5.3.11 (according to MITRE description), and fixed in later revisions.
- The openSUSE advisory indicates that the vulnerability was found via commit `4a9d46a9fe14` and was assigned bugzilla ID 1157171.
