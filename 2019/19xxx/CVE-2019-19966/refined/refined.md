  "CVE-2019-19966": {
    "description": "In the Linux kernel before 5.1.6, there is a use-after-free in cpia2_exit() in drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2_v4l.c that will cause denial of service, aka CID-dea37a972655.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is a missing check of the return value of cpia2_init. When cpia2_init fails, the driver will still try to unregister usb driver and free memory which was already freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"

   "required_capabilities": "The vulnerability requires CONFIG_NL80211_TESTMODE to be enabled. However, SUSE Linux kernels do not enable this option by default. This makes SUSE Linux Enterprise products not affected by this problem."
