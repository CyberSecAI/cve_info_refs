# Zulip 2.0.8 security release

  [![](/_astro/tabbott.Y0j5haym_Z1qaMxj.webp)](author/tabbott/)  [Tim Abbott](author/tabbott/)   Dec 13, 2019 • 1 min read

We released Zulip Server 2.0.8 today. This is a security release, containing a
handful of cherry-picked changes since Zulip 2.0.7.

## What’s new

This release fixes a security bug in Zulip 1.9.0 and greater:

* CVE-2019-19775: Close open redirect in thumbnail view.

## Upgrading

All installations should upgrade promptly to secure their installations. See the
[upgrade instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release)
in the Zulip documentation.

If you’re upgrading from 2.0.x, then the code changes are small and there are no
migrations or dependency changes, so the risk of unexpected disruption is low.
If you’re upgrading from an older version, we recommend upgrading directly to
this latest release.

If you’re running a fork of master, you will need to
[rebase your fork](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-or-modify.html#upgrading-to-future-releases)
to get these fixes.

If you need help, best-effort support is available on
[chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community chat server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).

## Community

We love feedback from the Zulip user community. Here are a few ways you can
connect:

* Join
  [chat.zulip.org, the Zulip community Zulip server](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing/chat-zulip-org.html).
  Several streams have user feedback and discussion as their primary purpose.
* [Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/zulip), or join our
  [announcement mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/zulip-announce).
