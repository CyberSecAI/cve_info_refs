## Description

![@fcambus](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825456?v=4&size=48)[fcambus](https://github.com/fcambus)opened [on Dec 17, 2019](https://github.com/fontforge/libspiro/issues/21#issue-538970632)

Hi,

When building libspiro 20190731 with AddressSanitizer enabled and running the test suite, I found a stack-based buffer overflow in spiro\_to\_bpath0() in spiro.c.

In the test suite, `call-test14` to `call-test19` all trigger the same issue.

The issue can be triggered as follow:

```
./configure CFLAGS="-fsanitize=address"
make
./tests/call-test14

```

```
