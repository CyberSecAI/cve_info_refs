Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-19847:

*   **Vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow
*   **Location:** `spiro_to_bpath0()` function in `spiro.c`
*   **Root Cause:** A stack buffer overflow occurs within the `spiro_to_bpath0` function.
*   **Attack Vector:** By processing a crafted input using the libspiro library, specifically through the `test_curve` function, an attacker can trigger the overflow via the `call-test14` to `call-test19` test cases.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution due to overwriting stack memory.
*   **Reproducibility:** The issue can be reproduced by building libspiro with AddressSanitizer enabled and running the provided test cases (`./tests/call-test14`).
*   **Affected Versions:** libspiro version 20190731.
