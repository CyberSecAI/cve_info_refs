- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient filtering of user-controlled content type names when displayed in the content creation interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user creating content.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker crafts a malicious content type name, which is then displayed to a user in the content creation interface, leading to script execution in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have a role with the "Administer content types" permission to create/modify content types with malicious names.
