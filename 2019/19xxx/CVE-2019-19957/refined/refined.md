- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the `getNumberOfElements` function within `src/mms/iso_mms/server/mms_access_result.c`
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The `getNumberOfElements` function does not validate the `bufPos` and `elementLength` arguments before using them to access the `buffer`. This allows for the possibility of providing very large values for `bufPos` and `elementLength`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: This vulnerability can cause a segmentation fault due to an out-of-bounds read when accessing the `buffer`, leading to a crash of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing crafted input to the `getNumberOfElements` function, specifically very large values for `bufPos` and `elementLength`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to provide the malicious crafted input that controls the vulnerable `bufPos` and `elementLength` parameters. The attacker would need to interact with the application to trigger the execution of the vulnerable code path, which involves parsing and decoding MMS data.
