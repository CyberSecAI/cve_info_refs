# stored xss via group name and user full name

**[HackerOne report #686795](https://hackerone.com/reports/686795)** by `constructor2019` on 2019-09-03, assigned to `gitlab_cmaxim`:

Hi There,

### Summary

I found Stored XSS via group name & user full name in issues pages.

=================================

### Steps to reproduce

(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)

(1. login to your gitlab account and change your full name to this payload:

`"><img src=x onerror=alert(87)> "&gt;&lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)&gt;`

Like this:

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h02m48s_004_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/18639bfaf0dbac6d0b90a59462edfba940cbf305/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f63666463666437362d366364382d343362372d393861352d3362623164386637326432302f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326830326d3438735f3030345f2e706e67)

---

(2. The create a new group with name as payload:

`vvvvvvvvv"><img src=x onerror=alert(5434)>`

Like this:

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h03m29s_005_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/1e3222c3a1f55ae001914d81634aab47d5f0e4d4/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f33613031613362612d323536372d343530342d623238372d3434616266306630363637642f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326830336d3239735f3030355f2e706e67)

---

(3. Open your project and Start a new issue

---

(4. Assign labels to the issue

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h25m24s_007_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/66e50f6c6e037439abb512c4f55e6c7b311e415a/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f33313164613731362d323130382d343837612d623738362d6563383163393564343265662f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326832356d3234735f3030375f2e706e67)

---

(5.Then move the issue to group that we start it in the step 2

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h25m52s_008_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/3c017dc4ceab1515033fda10cd680b0166163f9d/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f62353635373665332d376236622d346138372d393264312d3766323539386638656330332f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326832356d3532735f3030385f2e706e67)

---

(6. reload your page and you will get alert message from group name & user full name in issues page

A-Alert message come's out from the user full name

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h01m12s_001_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/fe7b67e9b469069a994da75078b8756f6e6b6091/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f37376530313235332d316330632d343362312d396331382d6264326134643237666165612f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326830316d3132735f3030315f2e706e67)

B-Alert message come's our from group name

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h02m16s_003_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/c3200ea6d267c9863d154f87665da29ca61e28ef/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f38376666383230362d306535642d343633342d396330612d3163396235663263653064322f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326830326d3136735f3030335f2e706e67)

---

### Impact

The attacker can use this issue to execute malicious script code in the victim user browser

Tested on:

Google Chrome Version 76.0.3809.100 (Official Build) (64-bit)

### Examples

I have create account with a poc to see this issue:

site: <https://gitlab.com>

email: bana2313@gmail.com

password: hackeronegitlab

after login please open this site:

POC:

A-Alert message come's our from group name

[test12344321/dfsfdfsdfsdfsdfsdfdsf#5](https://gitlab.com/test12344321/dfsfdfsdfsdfsdfsdfdsf/issues/5 "\"><svg/style=\"display: block; z-index: 100000; opacity: 10; position: fixed; top: 0px; left: 0; width: 1000000px; height: 100000px; background-color: red;\"onmouseover=alert(document.domain)>")

B- Alert message come's out from the user full name

[vvvvrrrr434vvvvv/5555#8 (moved)](https://gitlab.com/vvvvrrrr434vvvvv/5555/issues/8 "test")

Note: i can see you the issue via above links without login but i have created a private group in order to keep this stored xss issue private.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

stored xss happen after adding the label name to the issue and move the issue to group alert message show up form unfiltered group name and user full name as we see in the photos above in the steps.

The place of the issue right here:

[![Ashampoo_Snap_2019.09.03_12h17m13s_006_.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/7a7e63401d353db62616810b4a05f9f5b2250ce1/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f34336138323831302d376364302d343562622d626662632d3836656363623664616334652f417368616d706f6f5f536e61705f323031392e30392e30335f31326831376d3133735f3030365f2e706e67)

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

the group name and user full name should be filtered in issues activity comment.

## Impact

Stored xss for every gitlab users who open the attacker page issue.

# GitLab Security Release: 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7

Learn more about GitLab Security Release: 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE)

Today we are releasing versions 12.5.1, 12.4.4, and 12.3.7 for GitLab Community Edition (CE) and Enterprise Edition (EE).

These versions contain important security fixes, and we strongly recommend that all GitLab installations be upgraded to one of these versions immediately. If you are unable to upgrade, consider [disabling Elasticsearch](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/elasticsearch.html#disabling-elasticsearch).

**Update** Two fixes for GitLab Omnibus inadvertently did not make it into this release, so we are releasing new minor versions in order to include those changes in all versions of GitLab. We **strongly recommend** that all installations be updated to the new versions (12.5.2, 12.4.5, 12.3.8) once they are available.

The vulnerability details will be made public on our [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/issues?label_name%5B%5D=security&scope=all&state=opened) in approximately 30 days.

Please read on for more information regarding this release.

## Path traversal with potential remote code execution

Improper parameter sanitization for Maven package registry could lead to privilege escalation and remote code execution vulnerabilities under certain conditions. The issue is now mitigated in the latest release and is assigned [CVE-2019-19088](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19088).

Thanks to @nyangawa of Chaitin Tech for responsibly reporting this vulnerability to us.

### Versions Affected

Affects GitLab EE 11.3 and later.

### Remediation

We **strongly recommend** that all installations running an affected version above are upgraded to the latest version as soon as possible.

## Private objects exposed through project import

Using the project import feature, it was possible for someone to obtain issue, merge request, and other data from private projects. The issue is now mitigated in the latest release and is assigned [CVE-2019-19309](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-19309).
