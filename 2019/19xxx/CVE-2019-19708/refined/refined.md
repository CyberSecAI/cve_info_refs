Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in how the VisualEditor handles pasted HTML content, specifically when elements with the `data-ve-clipboard-key` attribute are present. It improperly handles unsanitized markup if `clipboardKey` equals to `useClipboardData-0`, leading to execution of injected scripts.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious JavaScript can be injected into a webpage.
    *   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The VisualEditor fails to properly sanitize pasted HTML content, particularly when the content contains a specific attribute (`data-ve-clipboard-key`).
    *   **Trust of Unsanitized Markup:** The code logic incorrectly trusts markup based on the `clipboardKey` variable without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when the user pastes malicious HTML into the VisualEditor.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can potentially steal user session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify content on the wiki page.
    *   **Redirects:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Copy and Paste:** The attack vector is through the copy-paste functionality of the VisualEditor.
    *   **Malicious HTML:** An attacker must craft a specific HTML payload containing the `data-ve-clipboard-key` attribute and malicious JavaScript, typically within an `<img>` tag.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Create Malicious HTML:** An attacker needs to create HTML code containing the specific `data-ve-clipboard-key` attribute to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Social Engineering (Indirect):** An attacker needs to get the victim to copy the malicious HTML and paste it into the VisualEditor. This could involve tricking a user into copying from a malicious website.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported to security@ and assigned the CVE-2019-19708 ID.
*   The issue was confirmed to affect Firefox and Chrome, but not Safari.
*   Patches were developed and deployed to address the vulnerability. These patches involved sanitizing the HTML content during paste operations.
*   The fix involves sanitizing the content when using `beforePasteData.html` to handle pasted content.
* Backports were created for REL1_33 and REL1_34 branches and the vulnerability was fixed in the master branch
