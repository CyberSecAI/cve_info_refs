commit c735a988a9caa19b752565203b8c8924202a8555
Author: Will Deacon
Date: Fri Apr 5 18:39:38 2019 -0700
kernel/sysctl.c: fix out-of-bounds access when setting file-max
commit 9002b21465fa4d829edfc94a5a441005cffaa972 upstream.
Commit 32a5ad9c2285 ("sysctl: handle overflow for file-max") hooked up
min/max values for the file-max sysctl parameter via the .extra1 and
.extra2 fields in the corresponding struct ctl\_table entry.
Unfortunately, the minimum value points at the global 'zero' variable,
which is an int. This results in a KASAN splat when accessed as a long
by proc\_doulongvec\_minmax on 64-bit architectures:
| BUG: KASAN: global-out-of-bounds in \_\_do\_proc\_doulongvec\_minmax+0x5d8/0x6a0

Fix the splat by introducing a unsigned long 'zero\_ul' and using that
instead.

commit 822482bff7c53312f508c8e94b424823f66d67f8
Author: Matteo Croce
Date: Mon Mar 18 02:32:36 2019 +0100
percpu: stop printing kernel addresses
commit 00206a69ee32f03e6f40837684dcbe475ea02266 upstream.
Since commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
at boot "\_\_\_\_ptrval\_\_\_\_" is printed instead of actual addresses:
percpu: Embedded 38 pages/cpu @(\_\_\_\_ptrval\_\_\_\_) s124376 r0 d31272 u524288
Instead of changing the print to "%px", and leaking kernel addresses,
just remove the print completely, cfr. e.g. commit 071929dbdd865f77

ALSA: info: Fix racy addition/deletion of nodes
commit 8c2f870890fd28e023b0fcf49dcee333f2c8bad7 upstream.
The ALSA proc helper manages the child nodes in a linked list, but its
addition and deletion is done without any lock. This leads to a
corruption if they are operated concurrently. Usually this isn't a
problem because the proc entries are added sequentially in the driver
probe procedure itself. But the card registrations are done often
asynchronously, and the crash could be actually reproduced with
syzkaller.
This patch papers over it by protecting the link addition and deletion
with the parent's mutex. There is "access" mutex that is used for the
file access, and this can be reused for this purpose as well.

mm/vmstat.c: fix /proc/vmstat format for CONFIG\_DEBUG\_TLBFLUSH=y CONFIG\_SMP=n
commit e8277b3b52240ec1caad8e6df278863e4bf42eac upstream.
Commit 58bc4c34d249 ("mm/vmstat.c: skip NR\_TLB\_REMOTE\_FLUSH\* properly")
depends on skipping vmstat entries with empty name introduced in
7aaf77272358 ("mm: don't show nr\_indirectly\_reclaimable in
/proc/vmstat") but reverted in b29940c1abd7 ("mm: rename and change
semantics of nr\_indirectly\_reclaimable\_bytes").
So skipping no longer works and /proc/vmstat has misformatted lines " 0".
This patch simply shows debug counters "nr\_tlb\_remote\_\*" for UP.

mm/memory\_hotplug: do not unlock after failing to take the device\_hotplug\_lock
commit 37803841c92d7b327147e0b1be3436423189e1cf upstream.
When adding memory by probing a memory block in the sysfs interface,
there is an obvious issue where we will unlock the device\_hotplug\_lock
when we failed to takes it.
That issue was introduced in 8df1d0e4a265 ("mm/memory\_hotplug: make
add\_memory() take the device\_hotplug\_lock").
We should drop out in time when failing to take the device\_hotplug\_lock.

perf/ring\_buffer: Fix AUX record suppression
commit 339bc4183596e1f68c2c98a03b87aa124107c317 upstream.
The following commit:
1627314fb54a33e ("perf: Suppress AUX/OVERWRITE records")
has an unintended side-effect of also suppressing all AUX records with no flags
and non-zero size, so all the regular records in the full trace mode.
This breaks some use cases for people.
Fix this by restoring "regular" AUX records.

commit 0fcc4c8c044e117ac126ab6df4138ea9a67fa2a9 upstream.
When dev\_exception\_add() returns an error (due to a failed memory
allocation), make sure that we move the RCU preemption count back to where
it was before we were called. We dropped the RCU read lock inside the loop
body, so we can't just "break".

tpm: fix an invalid condition in tpm\_common\_poll
[ Upstream commit 7110629263469b4664d00b38ef80a656eddf3637 ]
The poll condition should only check response\_length,
because reads should only be issued if there is data to read.
The response\_read flag only prevents double writes.
The problem was that the write set the response\_read to false,
enqued a tpm job, and returned. Then application called poll
which checked the response\_read flag and returned EPOLLIN.
Then the application called read, but got nothing.
After all that the async\_work kicked in.
Added also mutex\_lock around the poll check to prevent
other possible race conditions.

sched/fair: Limit sched\_cfs\_period\_timer() loop to avoid hard lockup
[ Upstream commit 2e8e19226398db8265a8e675fcc0118b9e80c9e8 ]
With extremely short cfs\_period\_us setting on a parent task group with a large
number of children the for loop in sched\_cfs\_period\_timer() can run until the
watchdog fires. There is no guarantee that the call to hrtimer\_forward\_now()
will ever return 0. The large number of children can make
do\_sched\_cfs\_period\_timer() take longer than the period.
NMI watchdog: Watchdog detected hard LOCKUP on cpu 24
RIP: 0010:tg\_nop+0x0/0x10
walk\_tg\_tree\_from+0x29/0xb0

hrtimer\_interrupt+0x122/0x270
smp\_apic\_timer\_interrupt+0x6a/0x140
apic\_timer\_interrupt+0xf/0x20

To prevent this we add protection to the loop that detects when the loop has run
too many times and scales the period and quota up, proportionally, so that the timer
can complete before then next period expires. This preserves the relative runtime
quota while preventing the hard lockup.
A warning is issued reporting this state and the new values.

The clang option -Oz enables \*aggressive\* optimization for size,
which doesn't necessarily result in smaller images, but can have
negative impact on performance. Switch back to the less aggressive
-Os.
This reverts commit 6748cb3c299de1ffbe56733647b01dbcc398c419.

The ARS implementation implements exponential back-off on the poll
interval to prevent high-frequency access to the DIMM / platform

exceed the completion event by minutes. Allow root to reset the timeout
each time it probes the status. A one-second timeout is still enforced,
but root can otherwise can control the poll interval.

timers/sched\_clock: Prevent generic sched\_clock wrap caused by tick\_freeze()
commit 3f2552f7e9c5abef2775c53f7af66532f8bf65bc upstream.
tick\_freeze() introduced by suspend-to-idle in commit 124cf9117c5f ("PM /
sleep: Make it possible to quiesce timers during suspend-to-idle") uses
timekeeping\_suspend() instead of syscore\_suspend() during
suspend-to-idle. As a consequence generic sched\_clock will keep going
because sched\_clock\_suspend() and sched\_clock\_resume() are not invoked
during suspend-to-idle which can result in a generic sched\_clock wrap.
On a ARM system with suspend-to-idle enabled, sched\_clock is registered
as "56 bits at 13MHz, resolution 76ns, wraps every 4398046511101ns", which
means the real wrapping duration is 8796093022202ns.
[ 134.551779] suspend-to-idle suspend (timekeeping\_suspend())

sched\_clock was not stopped during suspend-to-idle, and sched\_clock\_poll
hrtimer was not expired because timekeeping\_suspend() was invoked during
suspend-to-idle. It makes sched\_clock wrap at kernel time 8796s.
To prevent this, invoke sched\_clock\_suspend() and sched\_clock\_resume() in
tick\_freeze() together with timekeeping\_suspend() and timekeeping\_resume().

perf event names will resolve to the correct h/w events on
family 17h and above processors.

mac80211: do not call driver wake\_tx\_queue op during reconfig
commit 4856bfd230985e43e84c26473c91028ff0a533bd upstream.
There are several scenarios in which mac80211 can call drv\_wake\_tx\_queue
after ieee80211\_restart\_hw has been called and has not yet completed.
Driver private structs are considered uninitialized until mac80211 has
uploaded the vifs, stations and keys again, so using private tx queue
data during that time is not safe.
The driver can also not rely on drv\_reconfig\_complete to figure out when
it is safe to accept drv\_wake\_tx\_queue calls again, because it is only
called after all tx queues are woken again.
To fix this, bail out early in drv\_wake\_tx\_queue if local->in\_reconfig
is set.

rt2x00: do not increment sequence number while re-transmitting

Currently rt2x00 devices retransmit the management frames with
incremented sequence number if hardware is assigning the sequence.
This is HW bug fixed already for non-QOS data frames, but it should
be fixed for management frames except beacon.
Without fix retransmitted frames have wrong SN:
AlphaNet\_e8:fb:36 Vivotek\_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1648, FN=0, Flags=........C Frame is not being retransmitted 1648 1

AlphaNet\_e8:fb:36 Vivotek\_52:31:51 Authentication, SN=1650, FN=0, Flags=....R...C Frame is being retransmitted 1650 1
With the fix SN stays correctly the same:

kprobes: Fix error check when reusing optimized probes
commit 5f843ed415581cfad4ef8fefe31c138a8346ca8a upstream.
The following commit introduced a bug in one of our error paths:
819319fc9346 ("kprobes: Return error if we fail to reuse kprobe instead of BUG\_ON()")
it missed to handle the return value of kprobe\_optready() as
error-value. In reality, the kprobe\_optready() returns a bool
result, so "true" case must be passed instead of 0.
This causes some errors on kprobe boot-time selftests on ARM:
[ ] Beginning kprobe tests...
[ ] Probe ARM code
[ ] kprobe
[ ] kretprobe
[ ] ARM instruction simulation
[ ] Check decoding tables
[ ] Run test cases
[ ] FAIL: test\_case\_handler not run
[ ] FAIL: Test andge r10, r11, r14, asr r7
[ ] FAIL: Scenario 11
...
[ ] FAIL: Scenario 7
[ ] Total instruction simulation tests=1631, pass=1433 fail=198
[ ] kprobe tests failed
This can happen if an optimized probe is unregistered and next
kprobe is registered on same address until the previous probe
is not reclaimed.
If this happens, a hidden aggregated probe may be kept in memory,
and no new kprobe can probe same address. Also, in that case
register\_kprobe() will return "1" instead of minus error value,
which can mislead caller logic.

x86/kprobes: Avoid kretprobe recursion bug
commit b191fa96ea6dc00d331dcc28c1f7db5e075693a0 upstream.
Avoid kretprobe recursion loop bg by setting a dummy
kprobes to current\_kprobe per-CPU variable.
This bug has been introduced with the asm-coded trampoline
code, since previously it used another kprobe for hooking
the function return placeholder (which only has a nop) and
trampoline handler was called from that kprobe.
This revives the old lost kprobe again.
With this fix, we don't see deadlock anymore.
And you can see that all inner-called kretprobe are skipped.
event\_1 235 0
event\_2 19375 19612
The 1st column is recorded count and the 2nd is missed count.
Above shows (event\_1 rec) + (event\_2 rec) ~= (event\_2 missed)
(some difference are here because the counter is racy)

This can happen if user puts the kretprobe on the function

Such functions should not be probed, so this adds a warning

arm64: futex: Restore oldval initialization to work around buggy compilers
commit ff8acf929014b7f87315588e0daf8597c8aa9d1c upstream.
Commit 045afc24124d ("arm64: futex: Fix FUTEX\_WAKE\_OP atomic ops with
non-zero result value") removed oldval's zero initialization in
arch\_futex\_atomic\_op\_inuser because it is not necessary. Unfortunately,
Android's arm64 GCC 4.9.4 [1] does not agree:
../kernel/futex.c: In function 'do\_futex':
../kernel/futex.c:1658:17: warning: 'oldval' may be used uninitialized
in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
return oldval == cmparg;
^
In file included from ../kernel/futex.c:73:0:
../arch/arm64/include/asm/futex.h:53:6: note: 'oldval' was declared here
int oldval, ret, tmp;
^
GCC fails to follow that when ret is non-zero, futex\_atomic\_op\_inuser
returns right away, avoiding the uninitialized use that it claims.

crypto: x86/poly1305 - fix overflow during partial reduction
commit 678cce4019d746da6c680c48ba9e6d417803e127 upstream.
The x86\_64 implementation of Poly1305 produces the wrong result on some
inputs because poly1305\_4block\_avx2() incorrectly assumes that when
partially reducing the accumulator, the bits carried from limb 'd4' to
limb 'h0' fit in a 32-bit integer. This is true for poly1305-generic
which processes only one block at a time. However, it's not true for
the AVX2 implementation, which processes 4 blocks at a time and
therefore can produce intermediate limbs about 4x larger.
Fix it by making the relevant calculations use 64-bit arithmetic rather
than 32-bit. Note that most of the carries already used 64-bit
arithmetic, but the d4 -> h0 carry was different for some reason.
To be safe I also made the same change to the corresponding SSE2 code,
though that only operates on 1 or 2 blocks at a time. I don't think
it's really needed for poly1305\_block\_sse2(), but it doesn't hurt
because it's already x86\_64 code. It \*might\* be needed for
poly1305\_2block\_sse2(), but overflows aren't easy to reproduce there.
This bug was originally detected by my patches that improve testmgr to
fuzz algorithms against their generic implementation. But also add a
test vector which reproduces it directly (in the AVX2 case).

x86/kvm: move kvm\_load/put\_guest\_xcr0 into atomic context
commit 1811d979c71621aafc7b879477202d286f7e863b upstream.
guest xcr0 could leak into host when MCE happens in guest mode. Because
do\_machine\_check() could schedule out at a few places.
For example:
kvm\_load\_guest\_xcr0
...
kvm\_x86\_ops->run(vcpu) {
vmx\_vcpu\_run
vmx\_complete\_atomic\_exit
kvm\_machine\_check
do\_machine\_check
do\_memory\_failure
memory\_failure
lock\_page
In this case, host\_xcr0 is 0x2ff, guest vcpu xcr0 is 0xff. After schedule
out, host cpu has guest xcr0 loaded (0xff).
In \_\_switch\_to {
switch\_fpu\_finish
copy\_kernel\_to\_fpregs
XRSTORS
If any bit i in XSTATE\_BV[i] == 1 and xcr0[i] == 0, XRSTORS will
generate #GP (In this case, bit 9). Then ex\_handler\_fprestore kicks in
and tries to reinitialize fpu by restoring init fpu state. Same story as
last #GP, except we get DOUBLE FAULT this time.

coredump: fix race condition between mmget\_not\_zero()/get\_task\_mm() and core dumping
commit 04f5866e41fb70690e28397487d8bd8eea7d712a upstream.
The core dumping code has always run without holding the mmap\_sem for
writing, despite that is the only way to ensure that the entire vma
layout will not change from under it. Only using some signal
serialization on the processes belonging to the mm is not nearly enough.
This was pointed out earlier. For example in Hugh's post from Jul 2017:
https://lkml.kernel.org/r/alpine.LSU.2.11.1707191716030.2055@eggly.anvils
"Not strictly relevant here, but a related note: I was very surprised
to discover, only quite recently, how handle\_mm\_fault() may be called
without down\_read(mmap\_sem) - when core dumping. That seems a
misguided optimization to me, which would also be nice to correct"
In particular because the growsdown and growsup can move the
vm\_start/vm\_end the various loops the core dump does around the vma will
not be consistent if page faults can happen concurrently.
Pretty much all users calling mmget\_not\_zero()/get\_task\_mm() and then
taking the mmap\_sem had the potential to introduce unexpected side
effects in the core dumping code.
Adding mmap\_sem for writing around the ->core\_dump invocation is a
viable long term fix, but it requires removing all copy user and page
faults and to replace them with get\_dump\_page() for all binary formats
which is not suitable as a short term fix.
For the time being this solution manually covers the places that can
confuse the core dump either by altering the vma layout or the vma flags
while it runs. Once ->core\_dump runs under mmap\_sem for writing the
function mmget\_still\_valid() can be dropped.
Allowing mmap\_sem protected sections to run in parallel with the
coredump provides some minor parallelism advantage to the swapoff code
(which seems to be safe enough by never mangling any vma field and can
keep doing swapins in parallel to the core dumping) and to some other
corner case.
In order to facilitate the backporting I added "Fixes: 86039bd3b4e6"
however the side effect of this same race condition in /proc/pid/mem
should be reproducible since before 2.6.12-rc2 so I couldn't add any
other "Fixes:" because there's no hash beyond the git genesis commit.
Because find\_extend\_vma() is the only location outside of the process
context that could modify the "mm" structures under mmap\_sem for
reading, by adding the mmget\_still\_valid() check to it, all other cases
that take the mmap\_sem for reading don't need the new check after
mmget\_not\_zero()/get\_task\_mm(). The expand\_stack() in page fault
context also doesn't need the new check, because all tasks under core
dumping are frozen.

Revert "svm: Fix AVIC incomplete IPI emulation"
commit 4a58038b9e420276157785afa0a0bbb4b9bc2265 upstream.
This reverts commit bb218fbcfaaa3b115d4cd7a43c0ca164f3a96e57.
As Oren Twaig pointed out the old discussion:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/8292231/
that the change coud potentially cause an extra IPI to be sent to
the destination vcpu because the AVIC hardware already set the IRR bit
before the incomplete IPI #VMEXIT with id=1 (target vcpu is not running).
Since writting to ICR and ICR2 will also set the IRR. If something triggers
the destination vcpu to get scheduled before the emulation finishes, then
this could result in an additional IPI.
Also, the issue mentioned in the commit bb218fbcfaaa was misdiagnosed.

When SCSI blk-mq is enabled, there is a bug in handling errors in

scsi\_request correctly when the dispatch of the command has been
failed. Since the upper layer code including the sg\_io ioctl expects to
receive any error status from result field of scsi\_request, the error is
silently ignored and this could cause data corruptions for some

vt: fix cursor when clearing the screen
commit b2ecf00631362a83744e5ec249947620db5e240c upstream.
The patch a6dbe4427559 ("vt: perform safe console erase in the right
order") introduced a bug. The conditional do\_update\_region() was
replaced by a call to update\_region() that does contain the conditional
already, but with unwanted extra side effects such as restoring the cursor
drawing.
In order to reproduce the bug:
- use framebuffer console with the AMDGPU driver
- type "links" to start the console www browser
- press 'q' and space to exit links
Now the cursor will be permanently visible in the center of the
screen. It will stay there until something overwrites it.
The bug goes away if we change update\_region() back to the conditional
do\_update\_region().

serial: sh-sci: Fix HSCIF RX sampling point calculation
commit ace965696da2611af759f0284e26342b7b6cec89 upstream.
There are several issues with the formula used for calculating the
deviation from the intended rate:
1. While min\_err and last\_stop are signed, srr and baud are unsigned.
Hence the signed values are promoted to unsigned, which will lead
to a bogus value of deviation if min\_err is negative,
2. Srr is the register field value, which is one less than the actual
sampling rate factor,
3. The divisions do not use rounding.
Fix this by casting unsigned variables to int, adding one to srr, and
using a single DIV\_ROUND\_CLOSEST().

ALSA: core: Fix card races between register and disconnect
commit 2a3f7221acddfe1caa9ff09b3a8158c39b2fdeac upstream.
There is a small race window in the card disconnection code that
allows the registration of another card with the very same card id.
This leads to a warning in procfs creation as caught by syzkaller.
The problem is that we delete snd\_cards and snd\_cards\_lock entries at
the very beginning of the disconnection procedure. This makes the
slot available to be assigned for another card object while the
disconnection procedure is being processed. Then it becomes possible
to issue a procfs registration with the existing file name although we
check the conflict beforehand.
The fix is simply to move the snd\_cards and snd\_cards\_lock clearances
at the end of the disconnection procedure. The references to these
entries are merely either from the global proc files like
/proc/asound/cards or from the card registration / disconnection, so
it should be fine to shift at the very end.

commit af4b54a2e5ba18259ff9aac445bf546dd60d037e upstream.
`ni6501\_alloc\_usb\_buffers()` is called from `ni6501\_auto\_attach()` to
allocate RX and TX buffers for USB transfers. It allocates
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf` followed by `devpriv->usb\_tx\_buf`. If the
allocation of `devpriv->usb\_tx\_buf` fails, it frees
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf`, leaving the pointer set dangling, and returns an
error. Later, `ni6501\_detach()` will be called from the core comedi
module code to clean up. `ni6501\_detach()` also frees both
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf` and `devpriv->usb\_tx\_buf`, but
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf` may have already beed freed, leading to a
double-free error. Fix it bu removing the call to
`kfree(devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf)` from `ni6501\_alloc\_usb\_buffers()`, relying
on `ni6501\_detach()` to free the memory.

staging: comedi: ni\_usb6501: Fix use of uninitialized mutex
commit 660cf4ce9d0f3497cc7456eaa6d74c8b71d6282c upstream.
If `ni6501\_auto\_attach()` returns an error, the core comedi module code
will call `ni6501\_detach()` to clean up. If `ni6501\_auto\_attach()`
successfully allocated the comedi device private data, `ni6501\_detach()`
assumes that a `struct mutex mut` contained in the private data has been
initialized and uses it. Unfortunately, there are a couple of places
where `ni6501\_auto\_attach()` can return an error after allocating the
device private data but before initializing the mutex, so this
assumption is invalid. Fix it by initializing the mutex just after
allocating the private data in `ni6501\_auto\_attach()` before any other
errors can be retturned. Also move the call to `usb\_set\_intfdata()`
just to keep the code a bit neater (either position for the call is
fine).
I believe this was the cause of the following syzbot crash report
:

staging: comedi: vmk80xx: Fix possible double-free of ->usb\_rx\_buf
commit 663d294b4768bfd89e529e069bffa544a830b5bf upstream.
`vmk80xx\_alloc\_usb\_buffers()` is called from `vmk80xx\_auto\_attach()` to
allocate RX and TX buffers for USB transfers. It allocates
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf` followed by `devpriv->usb\_tx\_buf`. If the
allocation of `devpriv->usb\_tx\_buf` fails, it frees
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf`, leaving the pointer set dangling, and returns an
error. Later, `vmk80xx\_detach()` will be called from the core comedi
module code to clean up. `vmk80xx\_detach()` also frees both
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf` and `devpriv->usb\_tx\_buf`, but
`devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf` may have already been freed, leading to a
double-free error. Fix it by removing the call to
`kfree(devpriv->usb\_rx\_buf)` from `vmk80xx\_alloc\_usb\_buffers()`, relying
on `vmk80xx\_detach()` to free the memory.

staging: comedi: vmk80xx: Fix use of uninitialized semaphore
commit 08b7c2f9208f0e2a32159e4e7a4831b7adb10a3e upstream.
If `vmk80xx\_auto\_attach()` returns an error, the core comedi module code
will call `vmk80xx\_detach()` to clean up. If `vmk80xx\_auto\_attach()`
successfully allocated the comedi device private data,
`vmk80xx\_detach()` assumes that a `struct semaphore limit\_sem` contained
in the private data has been initialized and uses it. Unfortunately,
there are a couple of places where `vmk80xx\_auto\_attach()` can return an
error after allocating the device private data but before initializing
the semaphore, so this assumption is invalid. Fix it by initializing
the semaphore just after allocating the private data in
`vmk80xx\_auto\_attach()` before any other errors can be returned.
I believe this was the cause of the following syzbot crash report
:

iio: core: fix a possible circular locking dependency
commit 7f75591fc5a123929a29636834d1bcb8b5c9fee3 upstream.
This fixes a possible circular locking dependency detected warning seen
with:
- CONFIG\_PROVE\_LOCKING=y
- consumer/provider IIO devices (ex: "voltage-divider" consumer of "adc")
When using the IIO consumer interface, e.g. iio\_channel\_get(), the consumer
device will likely call iio\_read\_channel\_raw() or similar that rely on
'info\_exist\_lock' mutex.
typically:
...
mutex\_lock(&chan->indio\_dev->info\_exist\_lock);
if (chan->indio\_dev->info == NULL) {
ret = -ENODEV;
goto err\_unlock;
}
ret = do\_some\_ops()
err\_unlock:
mutex\_unlock(&chan->indio\_dev->info\_exist\_lock);
return ret;
...
Same mutex is also hold in iio\_device\_unregister().
The following deadlock warning happens when:
- the consumer device has called an API like iio\_read\_channel\_raw()
at least once.
- the consumer driver is unregistered, removed (unbind from sysfs)

...
cdev\_device\_del() can be called without holding the lock. It should be safe
as info\_exist\_lock prevents kernelspace consumers to use the exported
routines during/after provider removal. cdev\_device\_del() is for userspace.
Help to reproduce:
See example: Documentation/devicetree/bindings/iio/afe/voltage-divider.txt
sysv {
compatible = "voltage-divider";
io-channels = <&adc 0>;
output-ohms = <22>;
full-ohms = <222>;
};
First, go to iio:deviceX for the "voltage-divider", do one read:
$ cd /sys/bus/iio/devices/iio:deviceX
$ cat in\_voltage0\_raw
Then, unbind the consumer driver. It triggers above deadlock warning.
$ cd /sys/bus/platform/drivers/iio-rescale/
$ echo sysv > unbind
Note I don't actually expect stable will pick this up all the
way back into IIO being in staging, but if's probably valid that
far back.

iio: adc: at91: disable adc channel interrupt in timeout case
commit 09c6bdee51183a575bf7546890c8c137a75a2b44 upstream.
Having a brief look at at91\_adc\_read\_raw() it is obvious that in the case
of a timeout the setting of AT91\_ADC\_CHDR and AT91\_ADC\_IDR registers is
omitted. If 2 different channels are queried we can end up with a
situation where two interrupts are enabled, but only one interrupt is
cleared in the interrupt handler. Resulting in a interrupt loop and a

commit 20ea39ef9f2f911bd01c69519e7d69cfec79fde3 upstream.
The trialmask is expected to have all bits set to 0 after allocation.
Currently kmalloc\_array() is used which does not zero the memory and so
random bits are set. This results in random channels being enabled when
they shouldn't. Replace kmalloc\_array() with kcalloc() which has the same
interface but zeros the memory.
Note the fix is actually required earlier than the below fixes tag, but
will require a manual backport due to move from kmalloc to kmalloc\_array.

commit 06003531502d06bc89d32528f6ec96bf978790f9 upstream.
When issuing the write DAC register and write eeprom command, the two
powerdown bits (PD0 and PD1) are assumed by the chip to be present in
the bytes sent. Leaving them at 0 implies "powerdown disabled" which is
a different state that the current one. By adding the current state of
the powerdown in the i2c write, the chip will correctly power-on exactly
like as it is at the moment of store\_eeprom call.
This is documented in MCP4725's datasheet, FIGURE 6-2: "Write Commands
for DAC Input Register and EEPROM" and MCP4726's datasheet, FIGURE 6-3:

Fix the calculation by just doing the maths involved for a nano value

iio:chemical:bme680: Fix SPI read interface
commit 73f3bc6da506711302bb67572440eb84b1ec4a2c upstream.
The SPI interface implementation was completely broken.
When using the SPI interface, there are only 7 address bits, the upper bit
is controlled by a page select register. The core needs access to both
ranges, so implement register read/write for both regions. The regmap
paging functionality didn't agree with a register that needs to be read
and modified, so I implemented a custom paging algorithm.
This fixes that the device wouldn't even probe in SPI mode.
The SPI interface then isn't different from I2C, merged them into the core,
and the I2C/SPI named registers are no longer needed.
Implemented register value caching for the registers to reduce the I2C/SPI
data transfers considerably.
The calibration set reads as all zeroes until some undefined point in time,
and I couldn't determine what makes it valid. The datasheet mentions these
registers but does not provide any hints on when they become valid, and they
aren't even enumerated in the memory map. So check the calibration and
retry reading it from the device after each measurement until it provides
something valid.
Despite the size this is suitable for a stable backport given that
it seems the SPI support never worked.

KVM: x86: svm: make sure NMI is injected after nmi\_singlestep
commit 99c221796a810055974b54c02e8f53297e48d146 upstream.
I noticed that apic test from kvm-unit-tests always hangs on my EPYC 7401P,
the hanging test nmi-after-sti is trying to deliver 30000 NMIs and tracing
shows that we're sometimes able to deliver a few but never all.
When we're trying to inject an NMI we may fail to do so immediately for
various reasons, however, we still need to inject it so enable\_nmi\_window()
arms nmi\_singlestep mode. #DB occurs as expected, but we're not checking
for pending NMIs before entering the guest and unless there's a different
event to process, the NMI will never get delivered.
Make KVM\_REQ\_EVENT request on the vCPU from db\_interception() to make sure
pending NMIs are checked and possibly injected.

KVM: x86: Don't clear EFER during SMM transitions for 32-bit vCPU
commit 8f4dc2e77cdfaf7e644ef29693fa229db29ee1de upstream.
Neither AMD nor Intel CPUs have an EFER field in the legacy SMRAM save
state area, i.e. don't save/restore EFER across SMM transitions. KVM
somewhat models this, e.g. doesn't clear EFER on entry to SMM if the
guest doesn't support long mode. But during RSM, KVM unconditionally
clears EFER so that it can get back to pure 32-bit mode in order to
start loading CRs with their actual non-SMM values.
Clear EFER only when it will be written when loading the non-SMM state
so as to preserve bits that can theoretically be set on 32-bit vCPUs,
e.g. KVM always emulates EFER\_SCE.
And because CR4.PAE is cleared only to play nice with EFER, wrap that
code in the long mode check as well. Note, this may result in a
compiler warning about cr4 being consumed uninitialized. Re-read CR4
even though it's technically unnecessary, as doing so allows for more
readable code and RSM emulation is not a performance critical path.

When add lease context, the iov\_base is allocated with smb21

CIFS: keep FileInfo handle live during oplock break
commit b98749cac4a695f084a5ff076f4510b23e353ecd upstream.
In the oplock break handler, writing pending changes from pages puts
the FileInfo handle. If the refcount reaches zero it closes the handle
and waits for any oplock break handler to return, thus causing a deadlock.
To prevent this situation:
\* We add a wait flag to cifsFileInfo\_put() to decide whether we should
wait for running/pending oplock break handlers
\* We keep an additionnal reference of the SMB FileInfo handle so that
for the rest of the handler putting the handle won't close it.
- The ref is bumped everytime we queue the handler via the
cifs\_queue\_oplock\_break() helper.
- The ref is decremented at the end of the handler
This bug was triggered by xfstest 464.

Revert "net/mlx5e: Enable reporting checksum unnecessary also for L3 packets"
[ Upstream commit 8c8811d46d00d119ffbe039a6e52a0b504df1c2c ]
This reverts commit b820e6fb0978f9c2ac438c199d2bb2f35950e9c9.
Prior the commit we are reverting, checksum unnecessary was only set when
both the L3 OK and L4 OK bits are set on the CQE. This caused packets
of IP protocols such as SCTP which are not dealt by the current HW L4
parser (hence the L4 OK bit is not set, but the L4 header type none bit
is set) to go through the checksum none code, where currently we wrongly
report checksum unnecessary for them, a regression. Fix this by a revert.
Note that on our usual track we report checksum complete, so the revert
isn't expected to have any notable performance impact. Also, when we are
not on the checksum complete track, the L4 protocols for which we report
checksum none are not high performance ones, we will still report
checksum unnecessary for UDP/TCP.

net/mlx5e: Rx, Check ip headers sanity
[ Upstream commit 0318a7b7fcad9765931146efa7ca3a034194737c ]
In the two places is\_last\_ethertype\_ip is being called, the caller will
be looking inside the ip header, to be safe, add ip{4,6} header sanity
check. And return true only on valid ip headers, i.e: the whole header
is contained in the linear part of the skb.
Note: Such situation is very rare and hard to reproduce, since mlx5e
allocates a large enough headroom to contain the largest header one can
imagine.

net/mlx5e: Rx, Fixup skb checksum for packets with tail padding
[ Upstream commit 0aa1d18615c163f92935b806dcaff9157645233a ]
When an ethernet frame with ip payload is padded, the padding octets are
not covered by the hardware checksum.
Prior to the cited commit, skb checksum was forced to be CHECKSUM\_NONE
when padding is detected. After it, the kernel will try to trim the
padding bytes and subtract their checksum from skb->csum.
In this patch we fixup skb->csum for any ip packet with tail padding of
any size, if any padding found.
FCS case is just one special case of this general purpose patch, hence,
it is removed.

net/mlx5e: Switch to Toeplitz RSS hash by default
[ Upstream commit 7ee2ace9c544a0886e02b54b625e521df8692d20 ]
Although XOR hash function can perform very well on some special use
cases, to align with all drivers, mlx5 driver should use Toeplitz hash
by default.
Toeplitz is more stable for the general use case and it is more standard
and reliable.
On top of that, since XOR (MLX5\_RX\_HASH\_FN\_INVERTED\_XOR8) gives only a
repeated 8 bits pattern. When used for udp tunneling RSS source port
manipulation it results in fixed source port, which will cause bad RSS
spread.

When binding multiple services with specific type 1Ki, 2Ki..,

The problem is at identify zero last\_type conditional provided

service type). Then, lookup function failure to finding node state
service type in next iteration.

tcp: tcp\_grow\_window() needs to respect tcp\_space()
[ Upstream commit 50ce163a72d817a99e8974222dcf2886d5deb1ae ]
For some reason, tcp\_grow\_window() correctly tests if enough room
is present before attempting to increase tp->rcv\_ssthresh,
but does not prevent it to grow past tcp\_space()
This is causing hard to debug issues, like failing
the (\_\_tcp\_select\_window(sk) >= tp->rcv\_wnd) test
in \_\_tcp\_ack\_snd\_check(), causing ACK delays and possibly
slow flows.
Depending on tcp\_rmem[2], MTU, skb->len/skb->truesize ratio,
we can see the problem happening on "netperf -t TCP\_RR -- -r 2000,2000"
after about 60 round trips, when the active side no longer sends
immediate acks.
This bug predates git history.

net: bridge: fix per-port af\_packet sockets
[ Upstream commit 3b2e2904deb314cc77a2192f506f2fd44e3d10d0 ]
When the commit below was introduced it changed two visible things:
- the skb was no longer passed through the protocol handlers with the
original device
- the skb was passed up the stack with skb->dev = bridge
The first change broke af\_packet sockets on bridge ports. For example we
use them for hostapd which listens for ETH\_P\_PAE packets on the ports.
We discussed two possible fixes:
- create a clone and pass it through NF\_HOOK(), act on the original skb
based on the result
- somehow signal to the caller from the okfn() that it was called,
meaning the skb is ok to be passed, which this patch is trying to
implement via returning 1 from the bridge link-local okfn()
Note that we rely on the fact that NF\_QUEUE/STOLEN would return 0 and
drop/error would return < 0 thus the okfn() is called only when the
return was 1, so we signal to the caller that it was called by preserving
the return value from nf\_hook().

failover: allow name change on IFF\_UP slave interfaces
[ Upstream commit 8065a779f17e94536a1c4dcee4f9d88011672f97 ]
When a netdev appears through hot plug then gets enslaved by a failover
master that is already up and running, the slave will be opened
right away after getting enslaved. Today there's a race that userspace
(udev) may fail to rename the slave if the kernel (net\_failover)
opens the slave earlier than when the userspace rename happens.
Unlike bond or team, the primary slave of failover can't be renamed by
userspace ahead of time, since the kernel initiated auto-enslavement is
unable to, or rather, is never meant to be synchronized with the rename
request from userspace.
As the failover slave interfaces are not designed to be operated
directly by userspace apps: IP configuration, filter rules with
regard to network traffic passing and etc., should all be done on master
interface. In general, userspace apps only care about the
name of master interface, while slave names are less important as long
as admin users can see reliable names that may carry
other information describing the netdev. For e.g., they can infer that
"ens3nsby" is a standby slave of "ens3", while for a
name like "eth0" they can't tell which master it belongs to.
Historically the name of IFF\_UP interface can't be changed because
there might be admin script or management software that is already
relying on such behavior and assumes that the slave name can't be
changed once UP. But failover is special: with the in-kernel
auto-enslavement mechanism, the userspace expectation for device
enumeration and bring-up order is already broken. Previously initramfs
and various userspace config tools were modified to bypass failover
slaves because of auto-enslavement and duplicate MAC address. Similarly,
in case that users care about seeing reliable slave name, the new type
of failover slaves needs to be taken care of specifically in userspace
anyway.
It's less risky to lift up the rename restriction on failover slave
which is already UP. Although it's possible this change may potentially
break userspace component (most likely configuration scripts or
management software) that assumes slave name can't be changed while
UP, it's relatively a limited and controllable set among all userspace
components, which can be fixed specifically to listen for the rename
events on failover slaves. Userspace component interacting with slaves
is expected to be changed to operate on failover master interface
instead, as the failover slave is dynamic in nature which may come and
go at any point. The goal is to make the role of failover slaves less
relevant, and userspace components should only deal with failover master
in the long run.

bonding: fix event handling for stacked bonds
[ Upstream commit 92480b3977fd3884649d404cbbaf839b70035699 ]
When a bond is enslaved to another bond, bond\_netdev\_event() only
handles the event as if the bond is a master, and skips treating the
bond as a slave.
This leads to a refcount leak on the slave, since we don't remove the
adjacency to its master and the master holds a reference on the slave.

ip link add bondL type bond
ip link add bondU type bond
ip link set bondL master bondU

crash). ([CVE-2019-15117](/security/CVE-2019-15117))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the

Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta

data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15118](/security/CVE-2019-15118))

It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-15505](/security/CVE-2019-15505))

Brad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly

implemented in the ptrace susbsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-15902](/security/CVE-2019-15902))

It was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-15918](/security/CVE-2019-15918))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-azure](/security/cves?package=linux-azure) - Linux kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems

## Details

USN-4162-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 18.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the RSI 91x Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not

did not handle detach operations correctly, leading to a use-after-free

vulnerability. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2018-21008](/security/CVE-2018-21008))

Wen Huang discovered that the Marvell Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a heap

overflow. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-14814](/security/CVE-2019-14814),

[CVE-2019-14815](/security/CVE-2019-14815), [CVE-2019-14816](/security/CVE-2019-14816))

Matt Delco discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly perform bounds checking when handling coalesced

MMIO write operations. A local attacker with write access to /dev/kvm could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-14821](/security/CVE-2019-14821))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the

Linux kernel did not properly validate device meta data. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15117](/security/CVE-2019-15117))

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the USB audio driver for the

Linux kernel improperly performed recursion while handling device meta

data. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-15118](/security/CVE-2019-15118))

It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-15505](/security/CVE-2019-15505))

Brad Spengler discovered that a Spectre mitigation was improperly

implemented in the ptrace susbsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker

could possibly use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-15902](/security/CVE-2019-15902))

It was discovered that the SMB networking file system implementation in the

Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. An attacker could use this to

expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2019-15918](/security/CVE-2019-15918))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

It can be reproduced by the following step:
  1. samba configured with: server max protocol = SMB2_10
  2. mount -o vers=default

When parse the mount version parameter, the 'ops' and 'vals'
was setted to smb30,  if negotiate result is smb21, just
update the 'ops' to smb21, but the 'vals' is still smb30.
When add lease context, the iov_base is allocated with smb21
ops, but the iov_len is initiallited with the smb30. Because
the iov_len is longer than iov_base, when send the message,
copy array out of bounds.

we need to keep the 'ops' and 'vals' consistent.
