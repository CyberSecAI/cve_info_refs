    "summary": "The provided content describes CVE-2019-15511, a vulnerability in GOG Galaxy where the GalaxyClientService.exe does not properly restrict commands sent via a local TCP connection. This allows an attacker to execute commands with SYSTEM privileges due to a lack of authentication and authorization.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for commands sent to the GalaxyClientService.exe via a local TCP connection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Broken Access Control: The service does not restrict commands sent via a local TCP connection.",
        "Lack of Authentication: No authentication is required to send commands to the service.",
         "Lack of Authorization: The service does not verify if the command sender has privileges to perform the requested action."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve Local Privilege Escalation by sending crafted commands to the service, gaining SYSTEM privileges on the Windows system where GOG Galaxy is installed. This allows for taking control of any file or service, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local TCP Connection: The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted packets to the service's local TCP port (9978/TCP).",
         "Packet Replay and Modification: An attacker can replay captured packets or modify them to perform unauthorized actions."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send TCP packets to the local port (9978/TCP) on the machine where GOG Galaxy is installed. This can be done by a local user.",
      "additional_info": "The content includes details of the vulnerable service, the communication protocol, and specific command types that can be exploited, including FixDirectoryPrivilegesRequest, CreateDirectoryRequest, InstallServiceRequest etc., It also contains a link to a proof-of-concept exploit on GitHub."
