## CVE-2019-15958

### Summary
A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network Manager (EPNM) could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with *root* privileges on the underlying operating system.

### Root Cause
The vulnerability exists because affected devices with the High Availability (HA) feature enabled do not properly perform input validation.

### Impact
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with *root*-level privileges on the underlying operating system.

### Attack Vector
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious file to either the HA active or standby device.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. However, recent software changes have reduced the attack surface of this vulnerability. Cisco PI releases 3.4.1, 3.5, 3.6, and EPNM Release 3.0.1 and later up to the First Fixed Release, require authentication in order to exploit this vulnerability. All prior versions do not require authentication to be exploited.

### Affected Products
Cisco PI Software releases prior to 3.4.2, 3.5.1, 3.6.0 Update 02 and Cisco EPNM releases prior to 3.0.2.

### Fixed Software
This vulnerability is fixed in the following Cisco PI Software releases and later:
*   3.4.2
*   3.5.1
*   3.6.0 Update 02
*   3.7.0

This vulnerability is fixed in the following Cisco EPNM releases and later:
*   3.0.2
*   3.1
