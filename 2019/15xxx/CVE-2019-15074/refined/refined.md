Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15074:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of attachment filenames within the MantisBT's Timeline feature. Specifically, the filename was directly used in the HTML output of the timeline, without proper encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because a malicious filename, containing embedded JavaScript, is stored within the database. When the timeline is displayed, this malicious script is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the MantisBT instance allows it, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser context.
- **Cookie Stealing:**  As noted in the description, an attacker could potentially steal user cookies, leading to session hijacking and account compromise.
- **Malicious Actions:**  An attacker could redirect users to malicious sites, perform actions on behalf of the user, or modify the appearance of the MantisBT interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a file with a specially crafted filename that contains malicious JavaScript code.
- **Timeline Display:** The malicious code is then executed when a user views the issue's timeline, specifically on the "My View Page."

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the MantisBT instance with the ability to upload file attachments to an issue.
- **Visibility to the Issue:** The attack will impact any user who has visibility to the issue where the malicious file is attached and views the My View Page.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced as part of a feature to show file attachment events in the timeline.
- The fix involves sanitizing the filename before display using the `string_html_specialchars` function, which encodes HTML special characters, thus preventing the browser from interpreting the filename as executable code.
- The vulnerability was present in MantisBT versions up to 2.21.1 and fixed in 2.21.2.
- The severity of the vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.6.
- The affected component is `core/classes/IssueAttachmentTimelineEvent.class.php`.
