{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The unidirectional routing mode, intended to prevent sibling contexts from communicating, was not being correctly applied when a child context initiated a new child context using `Router.method()`. This was due to a typing mistake in the code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect implementation of unidirectional routing mode.",
       "Lack of enforcement of intended isolation between sibling contexts."
    ],
    "impact": "Unintended communication between sibling contexts, potentially allowing information to flow between isolated environments.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor within a child context could potentially initiate a new child context without the unidirectional restriction, and then send messages to sibling contexts that should have been isolated.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to be able to execute code within a Mitogen child context and have the capability to create new child contexts."
  },
  "additional_details": "The issue was addressed in commit 5924af1566763e48c42028399ea0cd95c457b3dc. The fix ensures that the unidirectional routing mode is properly inherited by new child contexts initiated from existing child contexts. The maintainer disputes that this constitutes a vulnerability because this mode is only used in the Ansible extension, and its use was already covered by tests.",
  "cve_description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
