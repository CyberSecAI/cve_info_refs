{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The edit-file request in Bitbucket Server versions >= 4.13 allows writing to arbitrary files on the filesystem.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability due to lack of proper file path sanitization or validation in the edit-file endpoint.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker with write permission on a repository can write to any arbitrary file on the filesystem that is accessible to the user running Bitbucket Server. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code by the victim's Bitbucket Server instance.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via the edit-file endpoint of Bitbucket Server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs write permissions on a repository in the Bitbucket Server instance."
