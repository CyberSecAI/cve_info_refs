Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Total.js CMS does not properly enforce access controls on API endpoints, despite managing privileges correctly for front-end resources.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The CMS fails to restrict access to API calls based on user privileges.
- **Vertical and horizontal privilege escalation:**  A user with limited privileges can access API calls and resources they are not authorized to use, allowing them to escalate their privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to resources and functionalities that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.
- This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, and potentially to full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Direct API Manipulation:** The attacker directly sends requests to the API endpoints using tools like Burp Suite.
- **Bypassing Front-end Restrictions:** The attacker leverages the fact that the CMS access control only exists for the front-end.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the Total.js CMS, even with limited privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests and modify/forge them to send API requests. This can be done with tools like Burp Suite.
- The attacker also needs to know the API endpoints and their required request format to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Total.js CMS version 12.0
- The vulnerability allows authenticated users with limited privileges to perform actions they should not be authorized to do via API requests, e.g. calling the `/admin/api/pages/preview/` endpoint.
- The official report is available on GitHub.
