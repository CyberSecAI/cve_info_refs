Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-15993

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists due to a lack of proper authentication controls for information accessible through the web UI of Cisco Small Business Switches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authentication:** The web UI does not properly authenticate requests for sensitive information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive device information, including configuration files, can be accessed without proper authorization.
*   **CWE-287:** This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-287, which refers to improper authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain access to sensitive device information, including configuration files. This could lead to further compromise of the network by:
    * Revealing network topology and device configurations.
    * Exposing credentials used to manage the device.
    * Providing information to craft more targeted attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious HTTP request to the web UI of an affected device.
*   **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to perform.
*   **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):**  The attack doesn't require any user interaction to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated, remote attacker:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing to authenticate.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected switch's web UI.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects several Cisco Small Business Switch models, including the 200, 250, 300, 350, 350X, 500, and 550X series.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in firmware releases 2.5.0.92 and 1.4.11.4, depending on the switch series.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ken Pyle of CYBIR.
