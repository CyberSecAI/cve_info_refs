                 CVE-2019-15807 CVE-2019-15917 CVE-2019-15926

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2016-10905

    A race condition was discovered in the GFS2 file-system
    implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.  On a system
    using GFS2, a local attacker could use this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-9506

    Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen
    discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed
    the "KNOB attack".  An attacker that is nearby during pairing
    could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired
    devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication
    between them.

    This update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption
    key length of 56 bits.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14821

    Matt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced MMIO
    facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access in the kernel.
    A local attacker permitted to access /dev/kvm could use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14835

    Peter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing bounds check
    in vhost_net, the network back-end driver for KVM hosts, leading
    to a buffer overflow when the host begins live migration of a VM.
    An attacker in control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation on the host.

CVE-2019-15117

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds check in the
    usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a buffer
    over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices could possibly use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-15118

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported unbounded recursion in the
    usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack
    overflow.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15211

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that
    could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

    The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
    correctly if more than one device is bound to it.  An attacker
    able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2_usb driver that leads
    to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

    The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate
    that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

    The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
    sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An
    attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15220

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

    The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate
    USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap
    buffer overrun.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

    The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15807

    Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)
    did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
    expander.  This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15926

    It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently
    validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,
    leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.  A nearby attacker on
    the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.74-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

drivers/pps/pps.c: clear offset flags in PPS\_SETPARAMS ioctl
commit 5515e9a6273b8c02034466bcbd717ac9f53dab99 upstream.
The PPS assert/clear offset corrections are set by the PPS\_SETPARAMS
ioctl in the pps\_ktime structs, which also contain flags. The flags are
not initialized by applications (using the timepps.h header) and they
are not used by the kernel for anything except returning them back in
the PPS\_GETPARAMS ioctl.
Set the flags to zero to make it clear they are unused and avoid leaking
uninitialized data of the PPS\_SETPARAMS caller to other applications
that have a read access to the PPS device.

/proc//cmdline: add back the setproctitle() special case
commit d26d0cd97c88eb1a5704b42e41ab443406807810 upstream.
This makes the setproctitle() special case very explicit indeed, and
handles it with a separate helper function entirely. In the process, it
re-instates the original semantics of simply stopping at the first NUL
character when the original last NUL character is no longer there.
[ The original semantics can still be seen in mm/util.c: get\_cmdline()
that is limited to a fixed-size buffer ]
This makes the logic about when we use the string lengths etc much more
obvious, and makes it easier to see what we do and what the two very
different cases are.
Note that even when we allow walking past the end of the argument array
(because the setproctitle() might have overwritten and overflowed the
original argv[] strings), we only allow it when it overflows into the
environment region if it is immediately adjacent.
[ Fixed for missing 'count' checks noted by Alexey Izbyshev ]

/proc//cmdline: remove all the special cases
commit 3d712546d8ba9f25cdf080d79f90482aa4231ed4 upstream.
Start off with a clean slate that only reads exactly from arg\_start to
arg\_end, without any oddities. This simplifies the code and in the
process removes the case that caused us to potentially leak an
uninitialized byte from the temporary kernel buffer.
Note that in order to start from scratch with an understandable base,
this simplifies things \_too\_ much, and removes all the legacy logic to
handle setproctitle() having changed the argument strings.
We'll add back those special cases very differently in the next commit.

sched/fair: Use RCU accessors consistently for ->numa\_group
commit cb361d8cdef69990f6b4504dc1fd9a594d983c97 upstream.
The old code used RCU annotations and accessors inconsistently for
->numa\_group, which can lead to use-after-frees and NULL dereferences.
Let all accesses to ->numa\_group use proper RCU helpers to prevent such
issues.

sched/fair: Don't free p->numa\_faults with concurrent readers
commit 16d51a590a8ce3befb1308e0e7ab77f3b661af33 upstream.
When going through execve(), zero out the NUMA fault statistics instead of
freeing them.
During execve, the task is reachable through procfs and the scheduler. A
concurrent /proc/\*/sched reader can read data from a freed ->numa\_faults
allocation (confirmed by KASAN) and write it back to userspace.
I believe that it would also be possible for a use-after-free read to occur
through a race between a NUMA fault and execve(): task\_numa\_fault() can
lead to task\_numa\_compare(), which invokes task\_weight() on the currently
running task of a different CPU.
Another way to fix this would be to make ->numa\_faults RCU-managed or add
extra locking, but it seems easier to wipe the NUMA fault statistics on
execve.

Bluetooth: hci\_uart: check for missing tty operations
commit b36a1552d7319bbfd5cf7f08726c23c5c66d4f73 upstream.
Certain ttys operations (pty\_unix98\_ops) lack tiocmget() and tiocmset()
functions which are called by the certain HCI UART protocols (hci\_ath,
hci\_bcm, hci\_intel, hci\_mrvl, hci\_qca) via hci\_uart\_set\_flow\_control()
or directly. This leads to an execution at NULL and can be triggered by
an unprivileged user. Fix this by adding a helper function and a check
for the missing tty operations in the protocols code.
This fixes CVE-2019-10207. The Fixes: lines list commits where calls to
tiocm[gs]et() or hci\_uart\_set\_flow\_control() were added to the HCI UART
protocols.

commit 66b20ac0a1a10769d059d6903202f53494e3d902 upstream.
Fix a crash with multipath activated. It happends when ANA log
page is larger than MDTS and because of that ANA is disabled.
The driver then tries to access unallocated buffer when connecting
to a nvme target. The signature is as follows:
[ 300.433586] nvme nvme0: ANA log page size (8208) larger than MDTS (8192).

xfrm: policy: fix bydst hlist corruption on hash rebuild

The faulting address is the address of the old chain head,
free'd by xfrm\_hash\_resize().
In xfrm\_hash\_rehash(), chain heads get re-initialized without
any hlist\_del\_rcu:
for (i = hmask; i >= 0; i--)
INIT\_HLIST\_HEAD(odst + i);
Then, hlist\_del\_rcu() gets called on the about to-be-reinserted policy
when iterating the per-net list of policies.
hlist\_del\_rcu() will then make chain->first be nonzero again:
static inline void \_\_hlist\_del(struct hlist\_node \*n)
{
struct hlist\_node \*next = n->next; // address of next element in list
struct hlist\_node \*\*pprev = n->pprev;// location of previous elem, this
// can point at chain->first
WRITE\_ONCE(\*pprev, next); // chain->first points to next elem
if (next)
next->pprev = pprev;
Then, when we walk chainlist to find insertion point, we may find a
non-empty list even though we're supposedly reinserting the first
policy to an empty chain.
To fix this first unlink all exact and inexact policies instead of
zeroing the list heads.
Add the commands equivalent to the syzbot reproducer to xfrm\_policy.sh,
without fix KASAN catches the corruption as it happens, SLUB poisoning
detects it a bit later.

media: radio-raremono: change devm\_k\*alloc to k\*alloc
commit c666355e60ddb4748ead3bdd983e3f7f2224aaf0 upstream.
Change devm\_k\*alloc to k\*alloc to manually allocate memory
The manual allocation and freeing of memory is necessary because when
the USB radio is disconnected, the memory associated with devm\_k\*alloc
is freed. Meaning if we still have unresolved references to the radio
device, then we get use-after-free errors.
This patch fixes this by manually allocating memory, and freeing it in
the v4l2.release callback that gets called when the last radio device
exits.

media: pvrusb2: use a different format for warnings
commit 1753c7c4367aa1201e1e5d0a601897ab33444af1 upstream.
When the pvrusb2 driver detects that there's something wrong with the
device, it prints a warning message. Right now those message are
printed in two different formats:
1. \*\*\*WARNING\*\*\* message here
2. WARNING: message here
There's an issue with the second format. Syzkaller recognizes it as a
message produced by a WARN\_ON(), which is used to indicate a bug in the
kernel. However pvrusb2 prints those warnings to indicate an issue with
the device, not the bug in the kernel.
This patch changes the pvrusb2 driver to consistently use the first
warning message format. This will unblock syzkaller testing of this
driver.

vsock: correct removal of socket from the list
commit d5afa82c977ea06f7119058fa0eb8519ea501031 upstream.
The current vsock code for removal of socket from the list is both
subject to race and inefficient. It takes the lock, checks whether
the socket is in the list, drops the lock and if the socket was on the
list, deletes it from the list. This is subject to race because as soon
as the lock is dropped once it is checked for presence, that condition
cannot be relied upon for any decision. It is also inefficient because
if the socket is present in the list, it takes the lock twice.

## Details

It was discovered that the alarmtimer implementation in the Linux kernel

contained an integer overflow vulnerability. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-13053](/security/CVE-2018-13053))

Wen Xu discovered that the XFS filesystem implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly track inode validations. An attacker could use this

to construct a malicious XFS image that, when mounted, could cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-13093](/security/CVE-2018-13093))

Wen Xu discovered that the f2fs file system implementation in the Linux

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Subject: Linux kernel: multiple vulnerabilities in the USB subsystem x2

Hi!

I've previously reported vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel USB
drivers on this list [1] found with syzkaller [2]. The USB fuzzing
project has been on hold for a while, but has been resumed earlier
this year. Here's a new bunch of 15 CVEs.

As an experiment this time I've requested CVEs for 2 bugs
(CVE-2019-15290, CVE-2019-15291) that haven't yet been fixed (fixes
for the other 13 bugs are in the upstream kernel). Both have been
reported by syzbot over 4 months ago. I've made sure that these 2 bugs
are reproducible with a crafted USB device and crash a Linux laptop
(or rather crash the USB worker thread) with one of the distro
kernels.

There are many more still not fixed bugs shown here [3].

## Details

Hui Peng and Mathias Payer discovered that the Option USB High Speed driver

in the Linux kernel did not properly validate metadata received from the

device. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash). ([CVE-2018-19985](/security/CVE-2018-19985))

Zhipeng Xie discovered that an infinite loop could be triggered in the CFS

Linux kernel process scheduler. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2018-20784](/security/CVE-2018-20784))

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi device driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly validate certain Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS). A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(Wi-Fi disconnect). ([CVE-2019-0136](/security/CVE-2019-0136))

It was discovered that the Bluetooth UART implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly check for missing tty operations. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-10207](/security/CVE-2019-10207))

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not

sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking

protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux

devices. ([CVE-2019-10638](/security/CVE-2019-10638))

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the location of kernel

addresses could be exposed by the implementation of connection-less network

protocols in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could possibly use this to

assist in the exploitation of another vulnerability in the Linux kernel.

([CVE-2019-10639](/security/CVE-2019-10639))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the Linux kernel when

reference counting pages, leading to potential use-after-free issues. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11487](/security/CVE-2019-11487))

Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when

performing core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11599](/security/CVE-2019-11599))

It was discovered that a null pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the LSI Logic MegaRAID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-11810](/security/CVE-2019-11810))

properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14283](/security/CVE-2019-14283))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14284](/security/CVE-2019-14284))

Tuba Yavuz discovered that a race condition existed in the DesignWare USB3

DRD Controller device driver in the Linux kernel. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-14763](/security/CVE-2019-14763))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Debian Bug     : 930904

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

This updated advisory text mentions the additional non-security
changes and notes the need to install new binary packages.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-9506

    Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen
    discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed
    the "KNOB attack".  An attacker that is nearby during pairing
    could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired
    devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication
    between them.

    This update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption
    key length of 56 bits.

CVE-2019-11487

    Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE (Filesystem-in-Userspace)
    facility could be used to cause integer overflow in page reference
    counts, leading to a use-after-free.  On a system with sufficient
    physical memory, a local user permitted to create arbitrary FUSE
    mounts could use this for privilege escalation.

    By default, unprivileged users can only mount FUSE filesystems
    through fusermount, which limits the number of mounts created and
    should completely mitigate the issue.

CVE-2019-15211

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that
    could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

    The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
    correctly if more than one device is bound to it.  An attacker
    able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2_usb driver that leads
    to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15216

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the yurex driver that leads to
    a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

    The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate
    that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

    The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
    sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An
    attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15220

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

    The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate
    USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap
    buffer overrun.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

    The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15538

    Benjamin Moody reported that operations on XFS hung after a
    chgrp command failed due to a disk quota.  A local user on a
    system using XFS and disk quotas could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2019-15666

    The Hulk Robot tool found an incorrect range check in the network
    transformation (xfrm) layer, leading to out-of-bounds memory
    accesses.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15807

    Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)
    did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
    expander.  This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15924

    The Hulk Robot tool found a missing error check in the fm10k
    Ethernet driver, which could lead to a null pointer dereference
    and crash (BUG/oops).  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15926

    It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently
    validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,
    leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.  A nearby attacker on
    the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.189-3~deb8u1.  This version also includes a fix for Debian bug
#930904, and other fixes included in upstream stable updates.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 and linux-latest-4.9
packages.  You will need to use "apt-get upgrade --with-new-pkgs"
or "apt upgrade" as the binary package names have changed.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

                 CVE-2019-15926
Debian Bug     : 930904

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-9506

    Daniele Antonioli, Nils Ole Tippenhauer, and Kasper Rasmussen
    discovered a weakness in the Bluetooth pairing protocols, dubbed
    the "KNOB attack".  An attacker that is nearby during pairing
    could use this to weaken the encryption used between the paired
    devices, and then to eavesdrop on and/or spoof communication
    between them.

    This update mitigates the attack by requiring a minimum encryption
    key length of 56 bits.

CVE-2019-11487

    Jann Horn discovered that the FUSE (Filesystem-in-Userspace)
    facility could be used to cause integer overflow in page reference
    counts, leading to a use-after-free.  On a system with sufficient
    physical memory, a local user permitted to create arbitrary FUSE
    mounts could use this for privilege escalation.

    By default, unprivileged users can only mount FUSE filesystems
    through fusermount, which limits the number of mounts created and
    should completely mitigate the issue.

CVE-2019-15211

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the radio-raremono driver that
    could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15212

    The syzkaller tool found that the rio500 driver does not work
    correctly if more than one device is bound to it.  An attacker
    able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-15215

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the cpia2_usb driver that leads
    to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15216

    The syzkaller tool found a bug in the yurex driver that leads to
    a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and remove USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15218

    The syzkaller tool found that the smsusb driver did not validate
    that USB devices have the expected endpoints, potentially leading
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15219

    The syzkaller tool found that a device initialisation error in the
    sisusbvga driver could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An
    attacker able to add USB devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15220

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in the p54usb driver
    which could lead to a use-after-free.  An attacker able to add and
    remove USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15221

    The syzkaller tool found that the line6 driver did not validate
    USB devices' maximum packet sizes, which could lead to a heap
    buffer overrun.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15292

    The Hulk Robot tool found missing error checks in the Appletalk
    protocol implementation, which could lead to a use-after-free.
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15538

    Benjamin Moody reported that operations on XFS hung after a
    chgrp command failed due to a disk quota.  A local user on a
    system using XFS and disk quotas could use this for denial of
    service.

CVE-2019-15666

    The Hulk Robot tool found an incorrect range check in the network
    transformation (xfrm) layer, leading to out-of-bounds memory
    accesses.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-15807

    Jian Luo reported that the Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas)
    did not correctly handle failure to discover devices beyond a SAS
    expander.  This could lead to a resource leak and crash (BUG).
    The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15924

    The Hulk Robot tool found a missing error check in the fm10k
    Ethernet driver, which could lead to a null pointer dereference
    and crash (BUG/oops).  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-15926

    It was found that the ath6kl wifi driver did not consistently
    validate traffic class numbers in received control packets,
    leading to out-of-bounds memory accesses.  A nearby attacker on
    the same wifi network could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.189-3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

An update that solves 39 vulnerabilities and has 203 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-18551: There was an out of bounds write in the function
i2c\_smbus\_xfer\_emulated (bnc#1146163).
- CVE-2018-20976: A use after free exists, related to xfs\_fs\_fill\_super
failure (bnc#1146285).
- CVE-2018-21008: A use-after-free can be caused by the function
rsi\_mac80211\_detach in the file
drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi\_91x\_mac80211.c (bnc#1149591).
- CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816: Fix three heap-based
buffer overflows in marvell wifi chip driver kernel, that allowed local
users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (bnc#1146516 bnc#1146512 bnc#1146514)
- CVE-2019-14835: A buffer overflow flaw was found in the way Linux
kernel's vhost functionality that translates virtqueue buffers to IOVs,
logged the buffer descriptors during migration. A privileged guest user
able to pass descriptors with invalid length to the host when migration
is underway, could use this flaw to increase their privileges on the
host (bnc#1150112).
- CVE-2019-15030: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility
Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts
a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process
because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check (bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15031: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via an
interrupt. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a
transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process,
because MSR\_TM\_ACTIVE is misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c
(bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15090: In the qedi\_dbg\_\* family of functions, there was an
out-of-bounds read (bnc#1146399).
- CVE-2019-15098: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c in the Linux
kernel had a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an
endpoint descriptor (bnc#1146378 1146543).
- CVE-2019-15099: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/usb.c in the Linux
kernel had a NULL pointer dereference via an incomplete address in an
endpoint descriptor (bnc#1146368).
- CVE-2019-15117: parse\_audio\_mixer\_unit in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled a short descriptor, leading to out-of-bounds memory
access (bnc#1145920).
- CVE-2019-15118: check\_input\_term in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled recursion, leading to kernel stack exhaustion
(bnc#1145922).
- CVE-2019-15211: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because
drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c did not properly allocate memory
(bnc#1146519).
- CVE-2019-15212: There was a double-free caused by a malicious USB device
in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver (bnc#1146391).
- CVE-2019-15214: There was a use-after-free in the sound subsystem
because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted
too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c
(bnc#1146550).
- CVE-2019-15215: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2\_usb.c driver (bnc#1146425).
- CVE-2019-15216: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver
(bnc#1146361).
- CVE-2019-15217: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/zr364xx/zr364xx.c driver
(bnc#1146547).
- CVE-2019-15218: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver
(bnc#1146413).
- CVE-2019-15219: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver
(bnc#1146524).
- CVE-2019-15220: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/net/wireless/intersil/p54/p54usb.c driver
(bnc#1146526).
- CVE-2019-15221: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver (bnc#1146529).
- CVE-2019-15222: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/helper.c (motu\_microbookii) driver
(bnc#1146531).
- CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp\_output.c
change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly
backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new
vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was
intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write
queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can
trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel
crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. (for example) Linux
distributions that use 4.9.x longterm kernels or 4.14.x longterm kernels
(bnc#1146589)
- CVE-2019-15290: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the ath6kl\_usb\_alloc\_urb\_from\_pipe function in
the drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c driver (bnc#1146378 1146543).
- CVE-2019-15292: There was a use-after-free in atalk\_proc\_exit, related
to net/appletalk/atalk\_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and
net/appletalk/sysctl\_net\_atalk.c (bnc#1146678).
- CVE-2019-15538: XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of
being out of disk quota. xfs\_setattr\_nonsize is failing to unlock the
ILOCK after the xfs\_qm\_vop\_chown\_reserve call fails. This is primarily a
local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if
the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS (bnc#1148093).
- CVE-2019-15666: There was an out-of-bounds array access in
\_\_xfrm\_policy\_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because
verify\_newpolicy\_info in net/xfrm/xfrm\_user.c mishandled directory
validation (bnc#1148394).
- CVE-2019-15902: Misuse of the upstream "x86/ptrace: Fix possible
spectre-v1 in ptrace\_get\_debugreg()" commit reintroduced the Spectre
vulnerability that it aimed to eliminate. This occurred because the
backport process depends on cherry picking specific commits, and because
two (correctly ordered) code lines were swapped (bnc#1149376).
- CVE-2019-15917: There was a use-after-free issue when
hci\_uart\_register\_dev() fails in hci\_uart\_set\_proto() in
drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c (bnc#1149539).
- CVE-2019-15919: SMB2\_write in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free
(bnc#1149552).
- CVE-2019-15920: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel SMB2\_read in
fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free. NOTE: this was not fixed
correctly in 5.0.10; see the 5.0.11 ChangeLog, which documents a memory
leak (bnc#1149626).
- CVE-2019-15921: There was a memory leak issue when idr\_alloc() fails in
genl\_register\_family() in net/netlink/genetlink.c (bnc#1149602).
- CVE-2019-15924: fm10k\_init\_module in
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/fm10k/fm10k\_main.c had a NULL pointer
dereference because there is no -ENOMEM upon an alloc\_workqueue failure
(bnc#1149612).
- CVE-2019-15926: Out of bounds access exists in the functions
ath6kl\_wmi\_pstream\_timeout\_event\_rx and ath6kl\_wmi\_cac\_event\_rx in the
file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c (bnc#1149527).
- CVE-2019-15927: An out-of-bounds access exists in the function
build\_audio\_procunit in the file sound/usb/mixer.c (bnc#1149522).
- CVE-2019-9456: In the USB monitor driver there is a possible OOB write
due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of
privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
not needed for exploitation (bnc#1150025).

An update that solves 38 vulnerabilities and has 159 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.0 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2017-18551: There was an out of bounds write in the function
i2c\_smbus\_xfer\_emulated (bnc#1146163).
- CVE-2018-20976: A use after free exists, related to xfs\_fs\_fill\_super
failure (bnc#1146285).
- CVE-2018-21008: A use-after-free can be caused by the function
rsi\_mac80211\_detach in the file
drivers/net/wireless/rsi/rsi\_91x\_mac80211.c (bnc#1149591).
- CVE-2019-14814: A heap overflow in mwifiex\_set\_uap\_rates() function of
Marvell was fixed. (bnc#1146512).
- CVE-2019-14815: A heap overflow in mwifiex\_set\_wmm\_params() function of
Marvell Wifi Driver was fixed. (bnc#1146514).
- CVE-2019-14816: A heap overflow in mwifiex\_update\_vs\_ie() function of
Marvell Wifi Driver was fixed. (bnc#1146516).
- CVE-2019-14835: A vhost/vhost\_net kernel buffer overflow could lead to
guest to host kernel escape during live migration (bnc#1150112).
- CVE-2019-15030: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via a Facility
Unavailable exception. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts
a transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process
because of a missing arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c check (bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15031: In the Linux kernel on the powerpc platform, a local
user can read vector registers of other users' processes via an
interrupt. To exploit the venerability, a local user starts a
transaction (via the hardware transactional memory instruction tbegin)
and then accesses vector registers. At some point, the vector registers
will be corrupted with the values from a different local Linux process,
because MSR\_TM\_ACTIVE is misused in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c
(bnc#1149713).
- CVE-2019-15090: In the qedi\_dbg\_\* family of functions, there was an
out-of-bounds read (bnc#1146399).
- CVE-2019-15098: drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c had a NULL pointer
dereference via an incomplete address in an endpoint descriptor
(bnc#1146378).
- CVE-2019-15117: parse\_audio\_mixer\_unit in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled a short descriptor, leading to out-of-bounds memory
access (bnc#1145920).
- CVE-2019-15118: check\_input\_term in sound/usb/mixer.c in the Linux
kernel mishandled recursion, leading to kernel stack exhaustion
(bnc#1145922).
- CVE-2019-15211: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because
drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c did not properly allocate memory
(bnc#1146519).
- CVE-2019-15212: There was a double-free caused by a malicious USB device
in the drivers/usb/misc/rio500.c driver (bnc#1146391).
- CVE-2019-15214: There was a use-after-free in the sound subsystem
because card disconnection causes certain data structures to be deleted
too early. This is related to sound/core/init.c and sound/core/info.c
(bnc#1146550).
- CVE-2019-15215: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/media/usb/cpia2/cpia2\_usb.c driver (bnc#1146425).
- CVE-2019-15216: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/yurex.c driver
(bnc#1146361).
- CVE-2019-15217: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/zr364xx/zr364xx.c driver
(bnc#1146547).
- CVE-2019-15218: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/media/usb/siano/smsusb.c driver
(bnc#1146413).
- CVE-2019-15219: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the drivers/usb/misc/sisusbvga/sisusb.c driver
(bnc#1146524).
- CVE-2019-15220: There was a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB
device in the drivers/net/wireless/intersil/p54/p54usb.c driver
(bnc#1146526).
- CVE-2019-15221: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/line6/pcm.c driver (bnc#1146529).
- CVE-2019-15222: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the sound/usb/helper.c (motu\_microbookii) driver
(bnc#1146531).
- CVE-2019-15239: In the Linux kernel, a certain net/ipv4/tcp\_output.c
change, which was properly incorporated into 4.16.12, was incorrectly
backported to the earlier longterm kernels, introducing a new
vulnerability that was potentially more severe than the issue that was
intended to be fixed by backporting. Specifically, by adding to a write
queue between disconnection and re-connection, a local attacker can
trigger multiple use-after-free conditions. This can result in a kernel
crash, or potentially in privilege escalation. (bnc#1146589)
- CVE-2019-15290: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the ath6kl\_usb\_alloc\_urb\_from\_pipe function in
the drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/usb.c driver (bnc#1146378
bnc#1146543).
- CVE-2019-15292: There was a use-after-free in atalk\_proc\_exit, related
to net/appletalk/atalk\_proc.c, net/appletalk/ddp.c, and
net/appletalk/sysctl\_net\_atalk.c (bnc#1146678).
- CVE-2019-15538: XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of
being out of disk quota. xfs\_setattr\_nonsize is failing to unlock the
ILOCK after the xfs\_qm\_vop\_chown\_reserve call fails. This is primarily a
local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if
the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS (bnc#1148093).
- CVE-2019-15666: There was an out-of-bounds array access in
\_\_xfrm\_policy\_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because
verify\_newpolicy\_info in net/xfrm/xfrm\_user.c mishandled directory
validation (bnc#1148394).
- CVE-2019-15902: Misuse of the upstream "x86/ptrace: Fix possible
spectre-v1 in ptrace\_get\_debugreg()" commit reintroduced the Spectre
vulnerability that it aimed to eliminate. This occurred because the
backport process depends on cherry picking specific commits, and because
two (correctly ordered) code lines were swapped (bnc#1149376).
- CVE-2019-15917: There was a use-after-free issue when
hci\_uart\_register\_dev() fails in hci\_uart\_set\_proto() in
drivers/bluetooth/hci\_ldisc.c (bnc#1149539).
- CVE-2019-15919: SMB2\_write in fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free
(bnc#1149552).
- CVE-2019-15920: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel SMB2\_read in
fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c had a use-after-free. NOTE: this was not fixed
correctly in 5.0.10; see the 5.0.11 ChangeLog, which documents a memory
leak (bnc#1149626).
- CVE-2019-15921: There was a memory leak issue when idr\_alloc() fails in
genl\_register\_family() in net/netlink/genetlink.c (bnc#1149602).
- CVE-2019-15924: The fm10k\_init\_module in
drivers/net/ethernet/intel/fm10k/fm10k\_main.c had a NULL pointer
dereference because there is no -ENOMEM upon an alloc\_workqueue failure
(bnc#1149612).
- CVE-2019-15926: Out of bounds access exists in the functions
ath6kl\_wmi\_pstream\_timeout\_event\_rx and ath6kl\_wmi\_cac\_event\_rx in the
file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c (bnc#1149527).
- CVE-2019-15927: An out-of-bounds access exists in the function
build\_audio\_procunit in the file sound/usb/mixer.c (bnc#1149522).
- CVE-2019-9456: In USB monitor driver there is a possible OOB write due
to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of
privilege with System execution privileges needed. User interaction is
not needed for exploitation (bnc#1150025).
