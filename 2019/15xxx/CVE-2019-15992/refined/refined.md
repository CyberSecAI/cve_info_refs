Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15992:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insufficient restrictions on allowed Lua function calls within the scripting sandbox of Cisco ASA and FTD software. This allows user-supplied Lua scripts to bypass the sandbox.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The Lua interpreter implementation in Cisco ASA and FTD does not properly restrict the Lua functions that can be called by user-provided scripts.
*   **Heap Overflow:** Successful exploitation can lead to a heap overflow condition.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** Malicious Lua scripts can escape the intended scripting sandbox environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the underlying Linux operating system.
*   **Root Privileges:**  The executed code runs with root privileges, granting full control over the affected device.
*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can completely compromise the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
*   **Lua Script Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious Lua script, either via the Dynamic Access Policy (DAP) feature in ASA or through the Custom Application Detectors feature in FTD.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** Attackers must have valid administrative credentials to access the affected devices.
*   **Knowledge of Lua:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious Lua scripts designed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable devices.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Proof-of-Concept Available:** Proof-of-concept exploit code is publicly available.
*   **No Known Malicious Use:** At the time of the advisory, there was no known malicious use of this vulnerability.
*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixes:** Cisco released software updates to address the vulnerability, requiring both ASA/FTD updates and Firepower Management Center hotfixes for FTD.
*   **Dynamic Access Policy (DAP) for ASA:** Allows admin to create enhanced AAA policies using Lua scripts, which are executed within a sandbox.
*   **Custom Application Detectors for FTD:** Administrators can define custom logic to filter IP traffic through Lua scripts, which are executed within a sandbox.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base score of 7.2 (High severity) - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
