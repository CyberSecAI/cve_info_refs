### Description

Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center had an argument injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject additional arguments into Git commands, which could lead to remote code execution. Remote attackers can exploit this argument injection vulnerability if they are able to access a Git repository in Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center. If public access is enabled for a project or repository, then attackers are able to exploit this issue anonymously.

**Affected versions:**

* All versions of Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center before 5.16.10 (the fixed version for 5.16.x ), from 6.0.0 before 6.0.10 (the fixed version for 6.0.x), from 6.1.0 before 6.1.8 (the fixed version for 6.1.x), from 6.2.0 before 6.2.6 (the fixed version for 6.2.x), from 6.3.0 before 6.3.5 (the fixed version for 6.3.x), from 6.4.0 before 6.4.3 (the fixed version for 6.4.x), and from 6.5.0 before 6.5.2 (the fixed version for 6.5.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

* Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center 5.16.10 contains a fix available for download from [here](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket/download-archives)

### **Mitigation**

To help mitigate the issue, we have a hotfix available in the form of a plugin that can be enabled with zero downtime. You do not require the hotfix if you are already on a fixed version of Bitbucket, and the hotfix will refuse to install on any fixed version.

The hotfix works for Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Data Center instances and can be used to protect systems while planning and executing an upgrade to a fixed version.

Please note that installed apps may still introduce vulnerabilities, even with the hotfix installed. The hotfix only protects the *standard* *functionality* of Bitbucket.

**This hotfix covers:**

* Standard Bitbucket functionality and features
* Bitbucket Server and Data Center versions 4.0.0 and later
* Bitbucket Server and Data Center instances

#### To install the hotfix:

This hotfix is a *zero down time installation* - No restart is required after installing the hotfix.

1. Login to Bitbucket with your administrator account
2. Go to Administration (cog wheel) and navigate to “Addons” → “Manage apps“
3. Select “Upload App” and provide the URL: [bitbucket-bserv-11896-hotfix-1.0.0.jar![](/images/icons/link_attachment_7.gif)](/secure/attachment/376655/376655_bitbucket-bserv-11896-hotfix-1.0.0.jar "bitbucket-bserv-11896-hotfix-1.0.0.jar attached to BSERV-11947")
4. Click “Upload” and wait for the hotfix to install.

If you are unable to upload the hotfix with the URL provided or Bitbucket is behind a firewall, you can download the hotfix plugin Jar from this issue. You are then able to upload the Jar file using the same steps above.

After upgrading to a fixed version there’s no need to remove the hotfix manually; it will be uninstalled automatically as part of the upgrade process.

For additional details, see the [full advisory](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/Czc4Og).

### **Argument Injection**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center had an argument injection vulnerability, allowing an attacker to inject additional arguments into Git commands, which could lead to remote code execution. Remote attackers can exploit this argument injection vulnerability if they are able to access a Git repository in Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center. If public access is enabled for a project or repository, then attackers are able to exploit this issue anonymously.

All versions of Bitbucket Server & Bitbucket Data Center before 5.16.10 (the fixed version for 5.16.x ), from 6.0.0 before 6.0.10 (the fixed version for 6.0.x), from 6.1.0 before 6.1.8 (the fixed version for 6.1.x), from 6.2.0 before 6.2.6 (the fixed version for 6.2.x), from 6.3.0 before 6.3.5 (the fixed version for 6.3.x), from 6.4.0 before 6.4.3 (the fixed version for 6.4.x), and from 6.5.0 before 6.5.2 (the fixed version for 6.5.x) are affected by this vulnerability.

This issue can be tracked here: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-11947>

#### Acknowledgements

#### **If you can't upgrade to the latest version:**

| **If you have version…** | **…then upgrade to any of these versions** |
| --- | --- |
| 1.x  2.x  3.x  4.x  5.x | 5.16.10  6.0.10  6.1.8  6.2.6  6.3.5  6.4.3  6.5.2 |

#### Mitigation

To help mitigate the issue, we have a hotfix available in the form of a plugin that can be enabled with zero downtime. You do not require the hotfix if you are already on a fixed version of Bitbucket, and the hotfix will refuse to install on any fixed version.

The hotfix works for Bitbucket Server and Bitbucket Data Center instances and can be used to protect systems while planning and executing an upgrade to a fixed version.

Please note that installed apps may still introduce vulnerabilities, even with the hotfix installed. The hotfix only protects the *standard functionality* of Bitbucket.

##### **This hotfix covers:**

* Standard Bitbucket functionality and features
* Bitbucket Server and Data Center versions 4.0.0 and later
* Bitbucket Server and Data Center instances

##### To install the hotfix:

This hotfix is a *zero down time installation* - No restart is required after installing the hotfix.

1. Login to Bitbucket with your administrator account
2. Go to Administration (cog wheel) and navigate to “Addons” → “Manage apps“
3. Select “Upload App” and provide the URL:

   `<https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/attachment/376655/bitbucket-bserv-11896-hotfix-1.0.0.jar>`
4. Click “Upload” and wait for the hotfix to install.

If you are unable to upload the hotfix with the URL provided or Bitbucket is behind a firewall, you can download the hotfix plugin Jar from <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-11947>. You are then able to upload the Jar file using the same steps above.

After upgrading to a fixed version there’s no need to remove the hotfix manually; it will be uninstalled automatically as part of the upgrade process.
