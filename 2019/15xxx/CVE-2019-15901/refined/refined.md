Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incomplete implementation of privilege dropping in the `doas` utility on Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD when the `HAVE_LOGIN_CAP_H` macro is not defined. Specifically, when switching to a target user, the code only set the user ID (`setuid`) but failed to drop the groups of the original user. This deviates from the intended behavior of `doas` on OpenBSD, where `setusercontext(3)` with the `LOGIN_SETUSER` and `LOGIN_SETGROUP` flags, correctly drops groups, resulting in different behavior for Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD systems compared to OpenBSD.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Privilege Dropping:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to drop the original user's groups when switching to a target user. This means the process retains the groups of the calling user, potentially granting unintended access to resources.
*   **Inconsistent Behavior:** The different behavior between OpenBSD and Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD versions of doas creates an unexpected and potentially dangerous situation for users relying on consistent behavior. This inconsistency could lead to unexpected file access permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Although not a privilege escalation in a traditional sense (since `doas` is already expected to run commands as another user), the failure to drop the calling user's group could allow a lower-privileged user to run commands with higher group privileges, bypassing intended access control.
*   **Unintended File Access:** If a command executed via `doas` creates a file or directory, the file/directory's group ownership will be set to the calling user's group, which could be different than intended.
*   **Unexpected Permissions:** When a umask is set, files created via the vulnerable doas would have different permissions than expected (e.g. root:user instead of root:root), potentially leading to data corruption or access issues.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct `doas` invocation:** A user with permissions to execute commands via `doas` could leverage the vulnerability to run commands with unintended group privileges.
*   **Cron Jobs/Automated tasks:** Automated tasks or scripts executed through `doas` might lead to unexpected file permissions or security concerns due to retained group IDs of the calling user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to execute commands via `doas`. This means they must be listed in the doas configuration file (`doas.conf`) and authorized to run the command they intend to exploit.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by applying a patch that implemented `setresgid`, `initgroups`, and `setresuid` for Linux, FreeBSD and NetBSD to correctly drop groups when switching to the target user when `HAVE_LOGIN_CAP_H` is not defined.
*   The patch was motivated by the fact that the vulnerable behavior was observed even on Illumos, which amplified concerns about the security issue.
*   The maintainer initially seemed to question if it was a security vulnerability, but ultimately agreed it was an inconsistency worth fixing.
*   The vulnerability existed in `doas.c` file.
