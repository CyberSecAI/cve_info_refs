### [Fantastic Support & Plugin](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/fantastic-support-plugin-3/)

Fantastic options & features, flexible, great layouts.
We just upgraded to this plugin, and we are very happy with the upgrade path. BV has thought through all of the potential issues when migrating to this plugin (every path I could foresee), and made the upgrade seamless.
Fantastic post-purchase support – as a developer myself, I appreciate the time and effort supplied.
Well worth the modest fee. Well worth it.

I have been using WP Recipe Maker for several years and could not be happier with it. It works; it delivers value surprises; it is frequently improved; and the developer seems to really care about my experience. Can’t ask for more than this. WP Recipe Maker is powering my cooking/food site to higher heights and leaving me more time for writing and cooking.

### [Inline styling / links issue](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/pointless-free-version-2/)

– In 2019, who uses inline styling for CSS? So there is no tweaking possible with CSS.
Granted, you can disable inline styling but then there is zero css in use and it just looks bad and would have to style the whole thing from the start which artificially forces a purchase of the paid version, unless i am missing something here?
– Each and every ingredient pointlessly links back to the same page and therefore provides a poor user experience. The only option is the no follow button premium option, again artificially forcing the premium version.
– I am frustrated at my time lost setting this all up to then be faced with these features that basically make the free version unusable.
It needs a way to remove inline styling without obliterating the formatting and the link for each individual ingredient needs to be removed too. As it is the free version is little more than a teaser. I appreciate you are not a charity but with all of the additional features the premium version offers there would have been a fair chance my client would have opted to purchase it eventually anyway, as it stands we will be forced to look at alternatives.

Beautiful Layout for recipes! It doesn’t display very in the list of blog posts, or in the list of posts with the same ingredient, but that’s a relatively minor annoyance.
