    {
      "CVE": "CVE-2019-15831",
      "description": "The changelog for Visitor Traffic Real Time Statistics plugin for WordPress mentions multiple security bug fixes in ajax requests in versions 7.3 and 6.9, and a security bug fix in version 6.8, related to Broken Access Control. Additionally, version 3.9 mentions an Authenticated (subscriber+) SQL Injection vulnerability.  Version 1.13 mentions a CSRF bug fixing by adding validation and sanitization of the POST to prevent SQL injection. Version 1.12 mentions CSRF bug fixing in settings page to prevent SQL injection. These suggest vulnerabilities in multiple areas of the plugin's code, such as handling of ajax requests, SQL queries, and access control.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerabilities appears to stem from inadequate validation and sanitization of user-supplied data within ajax requests and settings pages, leading to SQL injection and broken access control issues.  Additionally, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) was possible due to lack of proper checks.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Broken Access Control",
        "SQL Injection",
        "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
     ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information, modification of data, or complete compromise of the WordPress site. An attacker could bypass access restrictions, inject malicious SQL queries, or force users into unwanted actions.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Malicious AJAX requests",
        "Manipulation of POST data",
        "Exploiting vulnerable settings pages"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress server, potentially including malicious data in AJAX requests and POST parameters, or be able to trick an authenticated user into interacting with a malicious link.  The SQL injection vulnerability in v3.9 could be exploited by a user with 'subscriber' level access or higher."
