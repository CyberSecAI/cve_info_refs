Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-15818:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks within the "Simple 301 Redirects Addon Bulk Uploader" WordPress plugin. Specifically, the plugin does not verify user capabilities or use security nonces when handling CSV uploads for redirect rules, and when exporting/deleting redirect rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Unauthenticated Option Changes:**
    *   The plugin allows unauthenticated users to upload a CSV file containing redirect rules.
    *   The `save_bulk_redirects` function, responsible for processing the CSV, does not check user permissions before updating plugin settings (specifically the `301_redirects` option).
    *   This allows an attacker to inject malicious redirect rules into the site's settings.
2.  **Authenticated Options Export/Deletion:**
    *   The plugin utilizes `admin_action_*` hooks without proper capability checks or security nonces.
    *   The `export_bulk_redirects` function allows any logged-in user to export the redirect rules.
    *   The `clear_301_redirects` function allows any logged-in user to delete the redirect rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthenticated Option Changes:** An attacker can redirect all pages and posts of a vulnerable WordPress site to a malicious website. This leads to:
    *   **SEO Poisoning:** Search engine rankings can be negatively affected.
    *   **Phishing:** Users visiting the site could be redirected to phishing pages designed to steal credentials or other personal information.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Users could be redirected to pages that distribute malware.
    *   **Complete takeover of website:** A malicious actor can easily redirect website to another site.
*   **Authenticated Options Export/Deletion:**
    *   An attacker can export all redirect rules to analyze the website's structure.
    *   An attacker can delete all redirect rules causing the website to have broken links.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Unauthenticated Option Changes:** The attacker submits a crafted HTTP POST request to the WordPress site, including a malicious CSV file in the `$_FILES['301_bulk_redirects']` parameter and the `$_POST['submit_bulk_301']` set.
*  **Authenticated Options Export/Deletion:** The attacker, logged in as any user, can make a GET request to `wp-admin/admin.php?action=bulk301export` to export and `wp-admin/admin.php?action=bulk301clearlist` to clear the redirect rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Unauthenticated Option Changes:** The attacker needs no prior authentication on the target WordPress site.
*   **Authenticated Options Export/Deletion:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user on the target WordPress site (any user role is sufficient).

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerable plugin is an addon to the "Simple 301 Redirects" plugin, meaning the base plugin is required for exploitation.
*   The vulnerability was patched in version 1.2.5 of "Simple 301 Redirects Addon Bulk Uploader".
*  The plugin uses the "Location:" header to perform the redirection.
* The blog post from nintechnet provides a detailed breakdown of the vulnerable code and how it can be exploited.
