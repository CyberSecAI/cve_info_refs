### [Malicious code + Dashboard ads](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/malicious-code-dashboard-ads/)

[fatcb](https://profiles.wordpress.org/fatcb/ "Posts by fatcb")
February 11, 2020

Plugin created a vulnerability that was exploited en mass, no telling how many sites were infected.
Plugin also displays an ad for an unrelated plugin on every page of the dashboard. Has confused clients who think their agency is telling them to install a plugin. Ads were added in an update so this most affected long-term users who kept things up to date.
This is a simple plugin with too many issues. Avoid.

This plugin has been causing many sites to have spam links injected into the 301 redirects. Users going to your site are then redirected to malicious websites.
The author has not sufficiently alerted users to the severity of having this plugin not be updated. I’m not even certain the latest updated version fixed the issue. The changelog says nothing about it. Thus, do not trust this plugin. It causes a severe security issue, and the devs have not owned up to the problem.
To fix the issue, delete the spam redirects in the 301 Redirect Settings (I had 3), and be sure to remove this plugin. Having the regular 301 redirect plugin installed and active is still fine.

Just had this plugin used to hack my site and send it to JackieLovesDogs, then onto a spammy site. Avoid at all costs and delete this (and the 301 redirect plugin) ASAP!

First, thank you for this great free plugin. We’ve been using it for many years. Recently after upgrading WP to 5.9.5 (I know it’s an old version but bear with me). The following redirects no longer work
Request:/blog-test/blog-title.html?lang=en
However if I remove the ?lang=en parameter, it will work again. We’ve never had this issue before.
Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

All redirects randomly stopped working after being fine for many years. Now the redirected paths just return 404. 🤷

I have been using this plugin for years with no problems. This morning I noticed I had many 404 errors and none of the redirects were working. The plugin currently says it’s untested with WordPress 6.0.1 which is the version I am using.
Until a patch happens this plugin is useless.

Have been using this for a long time on a lot of sites, but something happened to the focus of the developers. The import functionality has been broken for quite a while now. Even if you import the export file of the plugin itself, it doesn’t work.

Just started using this again after making some changes to slugs that are ranking well in google.
Strange bad reviews with this plugin, there is nothing wrong with it, it works perfectly fine. Some user experience is required when redirecting URL’s and the proper way to do it. Site configuration (such as SSL) will determine how redirects happen as well as many other factors. This plugin simply redirects a URL -> NEW URL as 301 Redirect, that is all, everything else after this point has nothing to do with the plugin.
It bothers me when I see “bad” reviews for a developer trying to make money with a free plugin, this developer at least allows the two notices to be dismissed and never to be seen again unlike many other popular plugins with dashboard nag screens every time the dashboard is loaded.
However, I do recommend the developer fix the example on the interface above the redirect url section that shows an example of the URL.
Destination
example: https://www.yoursite.com//new-page/
Should be a single slash
Destination
example: https://www.yoursite.com/new-page/
Great work, I appreciate the plugin.

# Unauthenticated option changes in WordPress Simple 301 Redirects Addon Bulk Uploader plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [August 10, 2019 - 11:57pm [+0700]September 19, 2019 - 4:47am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/unauthenticated-option-changes-in-wordpress-simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader-plugin/)

The WordPress [Simple 301 Redirects Addon Bulk Uploader](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader/) plugin, which has 20,000+ active installations, was prone to a unauthenticated option changes vulnerability that could allow an attacker to redirect all pages and posts of the blog to a malicious website, as well as an authenticated options export/deletion vulnerability.

### Reference

CVE-2019-15818

### Summary

Simple 301 Redirects Addon Bulk Uploader is an addon to [Simple 301 Redirects](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects/) (which is required to run it), and allows users to import redirected URLs from a CSV file.

### Unauthenticated option changes

In the main script “simple-301-bulk-uploader.php” line 240, the plugin checks if the `$_POST['submit_bulk_301']` variable is set, whenever the plugin loads. If it is set, it will call “save\_bulk\_redirects” and pass on to the function the `$_FILES['301_bulk_redirects']` variable:

```

// if submitted, process the data
if ( isset( $_POST['submit_bulk_301'] ) ) {
   $report = $bulk_redirect_plugin->save_bulk_redirects( $_FILES['301_bulk_redirects'], (int) $_POST['auto_detect_end_line'] );
}

```

Line 114, “save\_bulk\_redirects” will check if the file is a CSV and will update the plugin settings with its content using the “update\_option” function line 170.

```

/*
   save the redirects from the options page to the database
*/
public function save_bulk_redirects( $data, $auto_detect = 0 ) {
   // Get Current Redirects
   $current_redirects = get_option( '301_redirects' );

   // Get CSV File
   $allowedExts = array( "csv" );
   $temp        = explode( ".", $data["name"] );
   $extension   = end( $temp );
   $report      = '';

   $mime_types = array(
      'application/csv',
      'application/excel',
      'application/ms-excel',
      'application/x-excel',
      'application/vnd.ms-excel',
      'application/vnd.msexcel',
      'application/octet-stream',
      'application/data',
      'application/x-csv',
      'application/txt',
      'plain/text',
      'text/anytext',
      'text/csv',
      'text/x-csv',
      'text/plain',
      'text/comma-separated-values'
   );

   if ( in_array( $data["type"], $mime_types ) && ( $data["size"] < 10000000 ) && in_array( $extension, $allowedExts ) ) {
      if ( $data["error"] > 0 ) {
         $report .= "Return Code: " . $data["error"] . "<br>";
      } else {
         $report .= "Upload: " . $data["name"] . "<br />";
         $report .= "Size: " . ( $data["size"] / 1024 ) . " kB<br /><br />";

         $row = 1;

         if ( $auto_detect == 1 ) {
            ini_set( 'auto_detect_line_endings', true );
         }

         if ( ( $handle = fopen( $data["tmp_name"], "r" ) ) !== false ) {
            while( ( $data = fgetcsv( $handle, 1000, "," ) ) !== false ) {
               $num = count( $data );
               $row ++;
               if ( ! isset( $current_redirects[ $data[0] ] ) && $data[1] !== '' ) {
                  $current_redirects[ $data[0] ] = $data[1];
                  $report                        .= "<strong>" . $data[0] . "</strong> " . __( 'was added to redirect to', 's301r-bulk-uploader' ) . $data[1] . "<br />";
               } elseif ( ! isset( $current_redirects[ $data[0] ] ) && $data[1] !== '' ) {
                  $report .= "<span style='color: red'><strong>" . $data[0] . "</strong> " . __( 'is missing a corresponding URL to redirect to', 's301r-bulk-uploader' ) . ".</span><br />";
               } else {
                  $report .= "<span style='color: red'><strong>" . $data[0] . "</strong> " . __( 'already exists and was not added', 's301r-bulk-uploader' ) . ".</span><br />";
               }
            }
            fclose( $handle );
            update_option( '301_redirects', $current_redirects );

```

Because there’s no capability check and no security nonce, an unauthenticated attacker can upload a CSV file to redirect all pages to a malicious website (cross-domain redirection is allowed). The redirection is performed via the “Location:” header:

```

$ curl https://example.org/ -I
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Server: nginx/1.14.2
Date: Sat, 27 Jul 2019 13:51:14 GMT
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Connection: keep-alive
Location: https://evil.com/

```
### Authenticated options export/deletion

In the same “simple-301-bulk-uploader.php” script, lines 234 and 237, the plugin uses the `admin_action_*` hook to load 2 functions: `export_bulk_redirects` and `clear_301_redirects`

```

// Create export action
add_action( 'admin_action_bulk301export', array( $bulk_redirect_plugin, 'export_bulk_redirects' ) );

// Create clear action
add_action( 'admin_action_bulk301clearlist', array( $bulk_redirect_plugin, 'clear_301_redirects' ) );

```

Here too, there’s no capability check and no security nonce either:

```

/*
   Export redirects to CSV
*/
public function export_bulk_redirects() {
   // Get Current Redirects
   $current_redirects = get_option( '301_redirects' );

   header( 'Content-Type: application/excel' );
   header( 'Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="301_redirects.csv"' );
   $data = array();

   foreach ( $current_redirects as $old_url => $new_url ) {
      $data[] = array( $old_url, $new_url );
   }

   $fp = fopen( 'php://output', 'w' );
   foreach ( $data as $line ) {
      fputcsv( $fp, $line );
   }
   fclose( $fp );
}

/*
   Clear 301 Redirects list
*/
public function clear_301_redirects() {
   update_option( '301_redirects', '' );
   header( "Location: " . $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'] );
}

```

Because the `admin_action_*` hook can be triggered by any logged-in user, accessing the following URLs would export and clear the plugin settings:

```

wp-admin/admin.php?action=bulk301export
wp-admin/admin.php?action=bulk301clearlist

```
