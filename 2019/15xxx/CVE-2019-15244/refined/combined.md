The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the web-based management interface and sending crafted requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  **Note:** The web-based management interface is enabled by default.  There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products The vulnerabilities affect the following Cisco Analog Telephone Adapter devices:    + Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter with firmware releases 1.4.1 SR4 and earlier   + Cisco SPA122 ATA with Router with firmware releases 1.4.1 SR4 and earlier   + Cisco ATA 190 Analog Telephone Adapter with firmware releases 1.2.2 SR1 and earlierProducts Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities. However, administrators may disable the affected feature as a mitigation.  Administrators can review settings for the web-based management interface in the Administration Settings section of the [Cisco SPA100 Series Phone Adapters Administration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/td/docs/voice_ip_comm/csbpvga/spa100-200/admin_guide_SPA100/spa100_ag_1_3_5.pdf).  Fixed Software  * Cisco will release free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html](http://)  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: [https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html](http://)  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco SPA100 Series Firmware Release 1.4.1SR5 will address these vulnerabilities for Cisco SPA112 2-Port Phone Adapter and Cisco SPA122 ATA with Router devices.  Cisco ATA 190 Series Analog Telephone Adapters Software Release 1.2(3)SR2 will address these vulnerabilities for Cisco ATA 190 Analog Telephone Adapter devices.
