- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `gnrc_tcp` parser for TCP options (`_option_parse`) does not terminate correctly on all inputs. Specifically, when it encounters an unknown option with a length of zero, it does not advance the option pointer, causing an infinite loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper handling for unknown TCP options with zero length. The `_option_parse` function fails to advance the option pointer when processing such an option, leading to an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The infinite loop consumes resources, potentially leading to battery drain and preventing the device from functioning correctly.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is sending a crafted TCP packet with an unknown TCP option and an option length of zero.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to send packets to the target device, likely requiring network access. They need to be able to craft a TCP packet with a specific, malformed option.
