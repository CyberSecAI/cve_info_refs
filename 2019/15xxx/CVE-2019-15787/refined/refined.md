The provided content is related to CVE-2019-15787.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in the zpool parser.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The zpool parser was vulnerable to an integer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The integer overflow could lead to a crash. The fix implemented in the patch returns `std::u64::MAX` instead of crashing, which prevents the program from crashing but may lead to unexpected behavior down the line.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could provide specially crafted input to the zpool parser to trigger the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be able to provide input to the zpool parser, which likely means having some level of access to the system/application that uses it or by providing malformed input.
