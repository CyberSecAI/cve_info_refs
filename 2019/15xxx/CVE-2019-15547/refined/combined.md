Affected Functions
Version
`ncurses::instr`

`ncurses::mvwinstr`

* `>=0`

`ncurses::mvwprintw`

* `>=0`

`ncurses::printw`

* `>=0`

### Description

`ncurses` exposes functions from the ncurses library which:

* Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of
  data, leading to a buffer overflow. (`instr`, `mvwinstr`, etc)
* Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile
  input to execute a format string attack, which trivially allows writing
  arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the `printw` family).

## Mishandling of format strings in ncurses

High severity

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-32v7-ghpr-c8hg)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-32v7-ghpr-c8hg/dependabot)

## Package

cargo

ncurses
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

<= 5.101.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

ncurses exposes functions from the ncurses library which:

* Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of data, leading to a buffer overflow. (instr, mvwinstr, etc)
* Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile input to execute a format string attack, which trivially allows writing arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the printw family).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
