Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The `ncurses` crate in Rust exposes functions from the underlying ncurses C library without proper safety checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **Buffer Overflow:** Functions like `instr`, `mvwinstr`, etc., pass buffers to C functions without specifying the buffer length. These C functions might write more data than the buffer can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
2.  **Format String Vulnerability:** Functions in the `printw` family pass Rust `&str` strings directly to C functions that expect C format arguments. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers, enabling them to write arbitrary data to stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Buffer Overflow:** Could potentially lead to denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Format String Attack:** Allows arbitrary data to be written to stack memory, which can be leveraged for control flow hijacking and arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerabilities are triggered by passing specific arguments to the affected ncurses functions.
*   Format string attacks require the attacker to control the input strings passed to `printw` family functions.
*  Buffer overflows are triggered by calling functions like `instr`, `mvwinstr` with insufficient buffer length.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the input to `ncurses` functions, specifically the arguments of vulnerable functions.
*   For format string attacks, the attacker needs to control the content of strings passed to `printw` style functions.
* No user interaction or special privileges are required for exploitation

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability affects all versions of the `ncurses` crate prior to a patch.
* The GitHub advisory database provides a CVSS v3 score of 7.5, indicating a high severity.
* The CWE associated with the issue is CWE-134 (Uncontrolled Format String).
* There are no patched versions available for this vulnerability.
* This vulnerability is also tracked as RUSTSEC-2019-0006 and GHSA-32v7-ghpr-c8hg.
