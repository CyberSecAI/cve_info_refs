```
- Root cause of vulnerability: A CGI script (changePassword.cgi) within the uaGate SI device handles URL parameters unsafely, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unsafe handling of URL parameters, leading to command injection vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the webserver. The command output is returned in the webserver's response. This can lead to complete control over the target device when combined with privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
- Attack vectors: By sending a specially crafted web request to the vulnerable CGI script, an authenticated attacker can inject and execute arbitrary commands.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker must be authenticated to the uaGate SI device.
