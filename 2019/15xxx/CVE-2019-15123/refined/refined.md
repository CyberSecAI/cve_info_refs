  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application allows an authenticated user to change the logo on the Website, but does not properly validate the file type. An attacker can upload a malicious .aspx file and gain remote code execution on the server.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unrestricted file upload",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, allowing an attacker to compromise the host serving the application and potentially gain a foothold on the internal network.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web application file upload functionality"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the application."
  },
  "mitigation": "The vendor doesn't disclose software versioning publicly, but a fixed version is believed to be available. General mitigation includes: 1) whitelisting allowed file extensions, 2) generating server-side file names with the correct extensions."
