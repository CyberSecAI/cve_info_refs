{
    "CVE-2019-15897": {
        "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly authenticate a user when performing filesystem operations.",
        "Weaknesses": [
            "Inadequate authentication of users during filesystem operations in BeeGFS."
        ],
        "Impact": "Users can perform operations that allow them to elevate their privileges to root, leading to complete system compromise.",
        "Attack vectors": "Any host able to communicate with the BeeGFS cluster can exploit the vulnerability.",
        "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the BeeGFS cluster and perform file system operations. No specific authentication is needed if connAuthFile is not configured properly."
    }
