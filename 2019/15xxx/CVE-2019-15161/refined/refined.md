{
  "CVE-2019-15161": {
    "Description": "The issue is caused by the reuse of a variable in `rpcapd/daemon.c` in libpcap before 1.9.1 when handling length values. This mishandling may allow an attacker to add extra data at the end of a request.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by reusing the `plen` variable which holds the remaining request length to compute the reply length. If the request has extra data at the end, the `plen` variable will not be reset to the correct size of the reply leading to a mismatch.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Mishandled length values due to variable reuse"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker may be able to send extra data at the end of a request by taking advantage of the mishandled length values in a reused variable.",
    "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted request to the `rpcapd` daemon.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the `rpcapd` daemon, implying they must have some form of network access to the service."
