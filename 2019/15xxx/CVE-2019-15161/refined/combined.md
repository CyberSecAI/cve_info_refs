Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-eaa681d33e
2019-10-27 01:08:27.202809
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.9.1
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.tcpdump.org>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.

Sunday, June 24, 2018, by mcr@sandelman.ca Summary for 1.9.0 libpcap release Added testing system to libpcap, independent of tcpdump Changes to how pcap\_t is activated Adding support for Large stream buffers on Endace DAG cards Changes to BSD 3-clause license to 2-clause licence Additions to TCP header parsing, per RFC3168 Add CMake build process (extensive number of changes) Assign a value for OpenBSD DLT\_OPENFLOW. Support setting non-blocking mode before activating. Extensive build support for Windows VS2010 and MINGW (many many changes, over many months) Added RPCAPD support when --enable-remote (default no) Add the rpcap daemon source and build instructions. Put back the greasy "save the capture filter string so we can tweak it" hack, that keeps libpcap from capturing rpcap traffic. Fixes for captures on MacOS, utun0 fixes so that non-AF\_INET addresses, are not ==AF\_INET6 addresses. Add a linktype for IBM SDLC frames containing SNA PDUs. pcap\_compile() in 1.8.0 and later is newly thread-safe. bound snaplen for linux tpacket\_v2 to ~64k Make VLAN filter handle both metadata and inline tags D-Bus captures can now be up to 128MB in size Added LORATAP DLT value Added DLT\_VSOCK for http://qemu-project.org/Features/VirtioVsock probe\_devices() fixes not to overrun buffer for name of device Add linux-specific pcap\_set\_protocol\_linux() to allow specifying a specific capture protocol. RDMA sniffing support for pcap Add Nordic Semiconductor Bluetooth LE sniffer link-layer header type. fixes for reading /etc/ethers Make it possible to build on Windows without packet.dll. Add tests for large file support on UN\*X. Solaris fixes to work with 2.8.6 configuration test now looks for header files, not capture devices present Fix to work with Berkeley YACC. fixes for DragonBSD compilation of pcap-netmap.c Clean up the ether\_hostton() stuff. Add an option to disable Linux memory-mapped capture support. Add DAG API support checks. Add Septel, Myricom SNF, and Riverbed TurboCap checks. Add checks for Linux USB, Linux Bluetooth, D-Bus, and RDMA sniffing support. Add a check for hardware time stamping on Linux. Don't bother supporting pre-2005 Visual Studio. Increased minimum autoconf version requirement to 2.64 Add DLT value 273 for XRA-31 sniffer Clean up handing of signal interrupts in pcap\_read\_nocb\_remote().

Tuesday January 9, 2001. guy@alum.mit.edu. Summary for 0.6 release
 New Linux libpcap implementation, which, in 2.2 and later kernels, uses PF\_PACKET sockets and supports kernel packet filtering (if compiled into the kernel), and supports the "any" device for capturing on all interfaces. Cleans up promiscuous mode better on pre-2.2 kernels, and has various other fixes (handles 2.4 ARPHRD\_IEEE802\_TR, handles ISDN devices better, doesn't show duplicate packets on loopback interface, etc.).
 Fixed HP-UX libpcap implementation to correctly get the PPA for an interface, to allow interfaces to be opened by interface name.
 libpcap savefiles have system-independent link-layer type values in the header, rather than sometimes platform-dependent DLT\_ values, to make it easier to exchange capture files between different OSes.
 Non-standard capture files produced by some Linux tcpdumps, e.g. the one from Red Hat Linux 6.2 and later, can now be read.
 Updated autoconf stock files.
 Filter expressions can filter on VLAN IDs and various OSI protocols, and work on Token Ring (with non-source-routed packets).
 "pcap\_open\_dead()" added to allow compiling filter expressions to pcap code without opening a capture device or capture file.
 Header files fixed to allow use in C++ programs.
 Removed dependancy on native headers for packet layout. Removed Linux specific headers that were shipped.
 Security fixes: Strcpy replaced with strlcpy, sprintf replaced with snprintf.
 Fixed bug that could cause subsequent "pcap\_compile()"s to fail erroneously after one compile failed.
 Assorted other bug fixes.
 README.aix and README.linux files added to describe platform-specific issues.
 "getifaddrs()" rather than SIOCGIFCONF used, if available.
v0.5 Sat Jun 10 11:09:15 PDT 2000
itojun@iijlab.net- Brought in KAME IPv6/IPsec bpf compiler.- Fixes for NetBSD.- Support added for OpenBSD DLT\_LOOP and BSD/OS DLT\_C\_HDLC (Cisco HDLC), and changes to work around different BSDs having different DLT\_ types with the same numeric value.
Assar Westerlund <assar@sics.se>- Building outside the source code tree fixed.- Changed to write out time stamps with 32-bit seconds and microseconds fields, regardless of whether those fields are 32 bits or 64 bits in the OS's native "struct timeval".- Changed "pcap\_lookupdev()" to dynamically grow the buffer into which the list of interfaces is read as necessary in order to hold the entire list.
Greg Troxel <gdt@ir.bbn.com>- Added a new "pcap\_compile\_nopcap()", which lets you compile a filter expression into a BPF program without having an open live capture or capture file.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-10 23:54:47 UTC  ``` rpcapd/daemon.c in libpcap before 1.9.1 mishandles certain length values because of reuse of a variable. This may open up an attack vector involving extra data at the end of a request.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/commit/617b12c0339db4891d117b661982126c495439ea>  References:  <https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/libpcap-1.9/CHANGES>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-10 23:58:19 UTC  ``` Created libpcap tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1760624](show_bug.cgi?id=1760624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16301 CVE-2019-15161 CVE-2019-15162 CVE-2019-15163 CVE-2019-15164 CVE-2019-15165 libpcap: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-16 16:35:44 UTC  ``` RPCAPD support added in tcpdump 1.9.0 (see <https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/libpcap-1.9/CHANGES#L74>). RHEL 6 and 7 ship an older version of libpcap that does not even have the vulnerable file. RHEL 8 ships a newer version, however it is not compiled with RPCAPD support (--enable-remote is not specified).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-16 16:35:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of libpcap as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 as they did not include support for RPCAPD.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-01-16 20:09:41 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-15161>   ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-4fe461079f
2019-10-27 01:29:09.690085
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.9.1
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.tcpdump.org>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-b92ce3144a
2019-10-27 02:05:07.760949
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 1.9.1
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <http://www.tcpdump.org>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.

## Commit

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Calculate the reply payload length in a local variable.

```
Using the same variable for the remaining request length and the reply
length is confusing at best and can cause errors at worst (if the
request had extra stuff at the end, so that the variable is non-zero).

This addresses Include Security issue I8: [libpcap] Remote Packet
Capture Daemon Parameter Reuse.
