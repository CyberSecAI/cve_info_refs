Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-15895:

**Root Cause:**
The WordPress Search Exclude plugin versions 1.2.2 and below had two vulnerabilities due to a lack of proper authorization and security checks when saving plugin settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthenticated settings change via `admin_init`:**
    *   The `saveOptions` function, which is responsible for saving plugin settings, was registered using the `admin_init` hook.
    *   This hook can be triggered by anyone, including unauthenticated users.
    *   The `saveOptions` function lacks both capability checks and a security nonce, allowing unauthorized modification of plugin settings.
2.  **Authenticated settings change via AJAX:**
    *   The `saveBulkEdit` function, which is used for bulk editing and saving settings, was registered via the `wp_ajax_*` hook.
    *   This function also lacks capability checks and security nonces.
    *   This allowed any authenticated user, even a subscriber, to change the plugin settings via the WordPress AJAX API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could modify the plugin's settings, specifically controlling which posts or pages are excluded from search results. This could lead to:

*   **Content manipulation/censorship:** An attacker could hide specific content from search results, making it difficult for users to find.
*   **SEO manipulation:** By hiding or showing content from search results, attackers could manipulate the site's search engine optimization.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Unauthenticated attack:** Sending a crafted POST request to trigger the `admin_init` hook with malicious settings data.
2.  **Authenticated attack:** Sending a crafted AJAX request to trigger the `wp_ajax_*` hook with malicious settings data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Unauthenticated attack:** No special privileges are needed, an attacker could be an anonymous user.
2.  **Authenticated attack:** The attacker would need to have an account on the WordPress site, even a low-privileged subscriber role would be enough.
