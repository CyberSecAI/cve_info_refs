# Settings change vulnerability in WordPress Search Exclude plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [September 7, 2019 - 8:35pm [+0700]September 7, 2019 - 8:36pm [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/settings-change-vulnerability-in-wordpress-search-exclude-plugin/)

The WordPress [Search Exclude plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/search-exclude/), which has 30,000+ active installations, was prone to two vulnerabilities that could allow anyone to change its settings in version 1.2.2 and below.

### Reference

CVE-2019-15895

### Unauthenticated settings change via admin\_init

In the main “search-exclude.php” script, line 40, the plugin registers the `saveOptions` function via the `admin_init` hook:

```

add_action('admin_init', array($this, 'saveOptions') );

```

The function, located lines 297-304, lacks capability check and a security nonce:

```

public function saveOptions()
{
   if (isset($_POST['search_exclude_submit'])) {

      $excluded = $_POST['sep_exclude'];
      $this->saveExcluded($excluded);
   }
}

```

Because the `admin_init` hook can be triggered by anyone, as we have seen in the [Ocean Extra](https://blog.nintechnet.com/settings-change-and-css-injection-in-wordpress-ocean-extra-plugin/) and [Easy WP SMTP](https://blog.nintechnet.com/critical-0day-vulnerability-fixed-in-wordpress-easy-wp-smtp-plugin/) plugins vulnerability reports, an unauthenticated user can change the settings of the plugin.

### Authenticated settings change via AJAX

Line 56, the plugin registers the `saveBulkEdit` function via the `wp_ajax_*` hook:

```

add_action('wp_ajax_search_exclude_save_bulk_edit', array($this, 'saveBulkEdit'));

```

The function, located lines 141-148, lacks capability check and a security nonce, allowing an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, to change the settings via WordPress AJAX API:

```

public function saveBulkEdit()
{
   $postIds = !empty($_POST['post_ids']) ? $_POST[ 'post_ids' ] : false;
   $exclude = isset($_POST['sep_exclude']) && '' !== $_POST['sep_exclude']  ? $_POST[ 'sep_exclude' ] : null;
   if (is_array($postIds) && null !== $exclude) {
       $this->savePostIdsToSearchExclude($postIds, $exclude);
    }
}

```
### Timeline

The vulnerability was discovered and reported to the wordpress.org team on August 30, 2019.

### Recommendations

Update as soon as possible if you have version 1.2.2 or below installed.

If you are using our web application firewall for WordPress, [NinjaFirewall WP Edition](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ninjafirewall/) (free) and [NinjaFirewall WP+ Edition](https://nintechnet.com/ninjafirewall/wp-edition/) (premium), you are protected against this vulnerability.

## Installation

1. Upload `search-exclude` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress
3. Go to any post/page edit page and check off the checkbox `Exclude from Search Results` if you don’t want the post/page to be shown in the search results

## FAQ

### Does this plugin affect SEO?

No, it does not affect crawling and indexing by search engines.

The ONLY thing it does is hiding selected post/pages from your site search page. Not altering SEO indexing.

If you want posts/pages to be hidden from search engines you may add the following snippet to your `functions.php`:

```
function add_meta_for_search_excluded()
{
    global $post;
    if (false !== array_search($post->ID, get_option('sep_exclude', array()))) {
        echo '<meta name="robots" content="noindex,nofollow" />', "\n";
    }
}
add_action('wp_head', 'add_meta_for_search_excluded');

```

Note: already indexed pages will remain indexed for quite a while. In order to remove them from Google index, you may use Google Search Console (or similar tool for other engines).

### Are there any hooks or actions available to customize plugin behaviour?

Yes.

There is an action `searchexclude_hide_from_search`.

You can pass any post/page/custom\_post ids as an array in the first parameter.

The second parameter specifies state of visibility in search. Pass true if you want to hide posts/pages,

or false – if you want show them in the search results.

Example:

Let’s say you want “Exclude from Search Results” checkbox to be checked off by default

for newly created posts, but not pages. In this case you can add following code

to your theme’s function.php:

```
add_filter('default_content', 'exclude_new_post_by_default', 10, 2);
function exclude_new_post_by_default($content, $post)
{
    if ('post' === $post->post_type) {
        do_action('searchexclude_hide_from_search', array($post->ID), true);
    }
}

```

Also there is a filter `searchexclude_filter_search`.

With this filter you can turn on/off search filtering dynamically.

Parameters:

$exclude – current search filtering state (specifies whether to filter search or not)

$query – current WP\_Query object

By returning true or false you can turn search filtering respectively.

Example:

Let’s say you need to disable search filtering if searching by specific post\_type.

In this case you could add following code to you functions.php:

```
add_filter('searchexclude_filter_search', 'filterForProducts', 10, 2);
function filterForProducts($exclude, $query)
{
    return $exclude && 'product' !== $query->get('post_type');
}

```

The plugin works excellent for what I need and I never had a problem so far. Some weeks ago an update came with a bug and thanks to this I lost all my exclude settings. I contacted the customer support and I can only say the best. They reacted quick and we could solve the problem together. I wouldn´t hestitate to contact them again in the future if there is another problem.

An upgrade of this plugin broke my site. Contacting support was easy and relatively fast.
Support was able to log in to my staging site and determine the issue was tied to my theme, so it was a special case. It took them a couple of weeks to put out a fix, but when they did, they contacted me to let me know it was available. The plugin works again as expected.
I appreciate the professionalism and the great plugin.
