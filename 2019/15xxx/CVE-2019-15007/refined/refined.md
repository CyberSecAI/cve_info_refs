Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the review resource of Atlassian Crucible and Fisheye. Specifically, the name of a missing branch is used without proper encoding, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is an XSS, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML or JavaScript. This is possible because the application doesn't neutralize or encode user-controlled input that is reflected back in a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser when they access a review resource.
*   **Data Theft and Manipulation:** The attacker can use the injected script to perform actions like stealing user cookies, modifying the page content, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing other actions that are usually allowed in the context of the victim's session.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker may be able to steal session tokens, thereby hijacking the user session and gaining unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is primarily over the network using HTTP requests, by manipulating the name of a missing branch.
*   **Remote:** The attacker can be remote, not requiring any specific access to the system, only the ability to make web requests to the vulnerable application and to create or manipulate reviews.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the XSS vulnerability.
*   **Ability to create a review or manipulate a review with a crafted name of a missing branch**  that contains malicious javascript or HTML.
*   **Ability to trigger the display:** The attacker would need to induce the victim to view the affected review resource.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability affects Atlassian Crucible and Fisheye.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions 4.7.3 and 4.8.0.
*   The severity is marked as "Medium" and "Severity 3 - Minor."
