Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15017:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The SSH service on the Zingbox Inspector is enabled and exposed to the local network.
*   The device has hardcoded credentials, which, when combined with the exposed SSH service, allows attackers to gain access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposed SSH Service:** The SSH service is running and accessible on the local network without proper restrictions.
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The device uses hardcoded credentials for authentication, making it vulnerable if the SSH service is exposed. (This is related to the vulnerability described in PAN-SA-2019-0027)
*   **CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials**

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Confidentiality Impact:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive information stored on the device.
*   **High Integrity Impact:** Attackers can modify or corrupt data and configurations on the device.
*   **High Availability Impact:** Attackers can disrupt the normal operation of the device, potentially causing it to become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Network:** The vulnerability is exploited through the local network where the Zingbox Inspector is connected.
*   **SSH Service:** The exposed SSH service is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the Zingbox Inspector.
*   **Knowledge of Hardcoded Credentials:** The attacker needs to know or obtain the hardcoded credentials to authenticate to the SSH service.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Zingbox Inspector versions 1.294 and earlier.
*   Version 1.295 and later are not affected.
*   The vulnerability was discovered internally during Palo Alto Networks' acquisition of Zingbox.
*   Mitigation involves updating to a patched version (1.295 or later) or disabling access to port 22 (SSH) on the Zingbox Inspector using a firewall.
