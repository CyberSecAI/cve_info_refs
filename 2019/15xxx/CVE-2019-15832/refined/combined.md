After extensively using the free version, I made the decision to upgrade to the premium version of this plugin, and I must say, it’s been a game-changer. In comparison to other popular plugins, this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. I highly recommend it.

The name “Real Time Statistics” is misleading. There is only one real time stat and its users online count, nothing more. So, if you want a real time statistics, this plugin is not for you. Plugin name should be: “Very Basic Traffic Stats”. Also if you are buying a pro version, there is nothing “more”. It’s not worth the money. If you want basic stats, then use free version. If you need something serious, do not buy, and go look for something more advanced traffic plugin. Not worth even a penny.

It worked for awhile, at least giving the number of hits. Now, it’s not reporting. Jetpack is giving me better stats. I’m uninstalling it; I don’t have time for broken stuff.

The last updates does not show what I really want to see:
The “hits” and the directory(items) of the “hits”.
The last functional version is 10.1 so stick to that one!
