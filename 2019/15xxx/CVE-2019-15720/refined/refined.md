- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CloudBerry Backup application allows users to configure pre and post backup actions using scripts. These scripts are executed with NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, even when the user configuring the backup plan has only user-level access.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Local Privilege Escalation. The application does not properly validate the privileges of users configuring backup plans, allowing user-level accounts to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM level privileges.

- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with user-level access can execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges, leading to complete control of the affected machine.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the CloudBerry Backup application's configuration interface. A local user can modify a backup plan and add a malicious script to the pre- or post-backup actions.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires user-level access to a machine with CloudBerry Backup installed. They also need the ability to modify backup plans within the CloudBerry Backup application.
