  "CVE-2019-15809": {
    "Description": "The content describes a side-channel vulnerability in ECDSA implementations where the bit-length of the scalar used in scalar multiplication is leaked. This can be exploited to recover the private key by observing a few hundred to a few thousand signatures, using lattice techniques.",
    "Root cause": "The root cause is a timing side-channel vulnerability in the implementation of scalar multiplication algorithms used in ECDSA, where the execution time varies based on the bit-length of the scalar.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Timing side-channel vulnerability",
      "Lack of constant-time implementation in scalar multiplication",
       "Use of incomplete addition formulas leading to short circuiting of special cases"
    ],
    "Impact": "Private key recovery for ECDSA. This allows an attacker to forge signatures and potentially impersonate the victim or decrypt encrypted communications.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Timing analysis of signature generation",
      "Observation of the time taken for scalar multiplication",
       "Remote timing attacks via network traffic analysis"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to measure the duration of ECDSA signing operations",
      "Collection of several signatures of known messages",
      "Lattice reduction computation",
        "Ability to observe or manipulate network traffic during TLS handshake when targeting remote servers"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability stems from variations in the execution time of the scalar multiplication algorithm depending on the bit-length of the scalar. The timing information can be exploited to recover the private key through lattice attacks. Implementations that use incomplete addition formulas that short-circuit special cases, and those using fixed-length loop bounds for scalar multiplication are vulnerable. The paper provides a novel technique by combining information of the bitlength of the nonce by applying geometric distributions on the information, which is then used by the lattice attack. The attack was successfully demonstrated against an Athena IDProtect card, libgcrypt, wolfSSL/wolfCrypt, MatrixSSL, SunEC/OpenJDK/OracleJDK, and Crypto++. A countermeasure is proposed using an equivalent scalar of fixed bit-length in the scalar multiplication."
