Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-15879:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition exists within the `cryptodev` module of FreeBSD. This module allows userland applications to offload cryptographic requests to kernel device drivers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The race condition allows a data structure in the kernel to be accessed after it has been freed by the `cryptodev` module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unprivileged process can overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, potentially leading to:
    - Information disclosure
    - Data modification
    - Denial of Service
    - Privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local exploitation by an unprivileged process.
- The attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition in the `cryptodev` module

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the vulnerable system.
- The attacker must be able to interact with the `cryptodev` module (although the module is not loaded by default).

**Additional Notes:**
- The `cryptodev` module is not loaded by default, and most applications do not use it.
- Use of accelerated software cryptography (e.g., AES-NI) via libraries like OpenSSL does not typically utilize the `cryptodev` module.
- NetApp products that incorporate FreeBSD are affected by this vulnerability if they use the `cryptodev` module. However, the advisory lists many products as not affected.
- The FreeBSD advisory provides specific patch information for various FreeBSD versions and branches.
