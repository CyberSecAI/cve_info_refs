Affected Functions
Version
`ncurses::instr`

* `>=0`

`ncurses::mvprintw`

* `>=0`

`ncurses::mvwinstr`

* `>=0`

`ncurses::mvwprintw`

* `>=0`

`ncurses::printw`

* `>=0`

### Description

`ncurses` exposes functions from the ncurses library which:

* Pass buffers without length to C functions that may write an arbitrary amount of
  data, leading to a buffer overflow. (`instr`, `mvwinstr`, etc)
* Passes rust &str to strings expecting C format arguments, allowing hostile
  input to execute a format string attack, which trivially allows writing
  arbitrary data to stack memory (functions in the `printw` family).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
