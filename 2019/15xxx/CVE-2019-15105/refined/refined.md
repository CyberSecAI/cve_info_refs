Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-15105:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw present in the `resourceid` parameter of the `/jsp/NewThresholdConfiguration.jsp` page within ManageEngine Applications Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input in the `resourceid` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL queries.
2.  **Command Injection:** Secondary to the SQL injection, the attacker can exploit a command injection vulnerability present in the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature. This allows the attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the server.
3.  **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, a low-authority user can create a new administrative user, thereby gaining elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can escalate their privileges from a low-authority user to an administrator by injecting SQL queries to create a new admin user.
2.  **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** After gaining administrative privileges, an attacker can upload and execute arbitrary code on the server through the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature, leading to full control of the affected system.
3.  **System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise, allowing the attacker to potentially steal sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

**Attack Vectors:**
1.  **SQL Injection:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to `/jsp/NewThresholdConfiguration.jsp` with a malicious SQL query in the `resourceid` parameter.
2.  **File Upload:** After gaining admin privileges the attacker uploads a malicious payload via the `Upload.do` endpoint.
3.  **Command Execution:** The attacker exploits the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature to execute the uploaded malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ManageEngine Applications Manager server.
2.  **Low-Authority User Credentials:** The attacker needs valid login credentials for a low-authority user account on the application.
3.  **Knowledge of SQL syntax:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious SQL queries to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability for the specific database.
4.  **Knowledge of the command execution feature:** The attacker needs to be able to leverage the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature.

**Additional Details:**
*   The exploit has been demonstrated to work against both MSSQL and PostgreSQL databases.
*   The Metasploit module provided automates the process of exploitation, including SQL injection, privilege escalation, file upload, and command execution.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Applications Manager version 14 build 14300.
*   The vulnerability was originally presented at the DEFCON AppSec Village.
