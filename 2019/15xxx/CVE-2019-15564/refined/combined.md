### @Theyiot **[Theyiot](/Theyiot)** commented [Jun 14, 2019](#issue-456239031)

The module partner\_compassion previously had a weakness making SQL injection feasible. This PR provides a defense against this, by using the method cursor.mogrify(), which parametrize a string and take care of escaping dangerous characters. This method is provided by PsycoPG, the Python API for PostgreSQL.

Sorry, something went wrong.
