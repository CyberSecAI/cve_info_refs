{
  "CVE-2019-15233": {
    "Description": "The Live Input Macros app for Confluence Server and Data Center versions 2.10 and before, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can execute JavaScript code on the Confluence site if a user adds malicious code. This can be used to steal the session cookie of an administrator (session hijacking).",
    "Root cause": "The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to session hijacking by stealing cookies, and potentially performing actions on behalf of the user.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a Live Input Macro on a Confluence page which is then viewed by an administrator."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to create or edit Confluence pages, and include the malicious code in a Live Input Macro. The attacker also needs to be able to convince a user (e.g., administrator) to view the page containing the malicious macro."
  }
