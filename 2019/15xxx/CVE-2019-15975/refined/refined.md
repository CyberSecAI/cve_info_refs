Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-15975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because a static encryption key is shared between installations of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Static encryption key:** Using a static, shared encryption key for session tokens.
-  **Authentication bypass:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms.
- **REST API vulnerability**: The REST API endpoint is vulnerable.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Administrative access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges on the affected device.
- **Complete compromise:** The attacker can have full control over the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **REST API:**  The attacker targets the REST API endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication.
- **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely.
- **Knowledge of static key:** The attacker needs access to the static encryption key shared across DCNM installations.
