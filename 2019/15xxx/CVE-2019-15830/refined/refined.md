Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Icegram plugin for WordPress fetches gallery data from an external source (`icegram[.]com`).
*   This data is then serialized and stored in the `ig_cat_list` option within the WordPress database.
*   The `save_gallery_data` function, responsible for updating this option, lacks proper permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Due to the lack of permission checks in the `save_gallery_data` function, any registered user can inject arbitrary data, including malicious JavaScript code, into the `ig_cat_list` option. This makes the XSS persistent, as the malicious code is stored in the database and executed whenever the plugin's admin page is accessed.
*   **Lack of Authorization/Permission Checks:** The core issue lies in the absence of proper authorization checks in the `save_gallery_data` function. This allows any authenticated user, even with low-level privileges like a subscriber, to modify plugin settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the admin area, leading to various impacts such as:
    *   **Account Hijacking:** Stealing admin session cookies, allowing the attacker to take over the administrator account.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting administrators to malicious sites or injecting malware into the website.
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive data from the WordPress backend.
    *   **Website Defacement:** Modifying website content or functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered via an AJAX request to the `save_gallery_data` action. This action is vulnerable due to the lack of permission checks.
*   **Data Injection:** An attacker injects a crafted array containing malicious JavaScript as gallery data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Registered User Account:** The attacker needs to have a user account on the WordPress website, even a subscriber-level account.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Function:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable action (`save_gallery_data`) and the structure of the data it expects to be able to inject the malicious payload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.10.28.2 and lower of the Icegram plugin.
*   The patched version is 1.10.29.
*   The plugin has over 40,000 installations, increasing the scope of potential exploitation.
*   The blog post mentions that Sucuri's Website Firewall can protect clients from this vulnerability.
