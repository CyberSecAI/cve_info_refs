### @yancyribbens **[yancyribbens](/yancyribbens)** commented [Jun 25, 2019](#issue-460300466)

This PR sanitizes the input to `delete_records` [here](https://github.com/YourAcclaim/block_acclaim/commit/7c8a11700717c992cd0a9ecd12175b0275173dc2). This `delete_records` call is used such that if a `badge_template` was already selected, and next, a different badge\_template is selected, the associated table will call `delete_records` on the previous and insert the most recent. The superfluous code was removed which checked if it existed before deleting and instead simplified to just call `delete_records` as suggested in [#8](https://github.com/YourAcclaim/block_acclaim/issues/8) regardless of if a record already exists and the tablename is no longer stored in a variable [here](https://github.com/YourAcclaim/block_acclaim/commit/36be9a43efd16b905c6d75db139a613ae2e905a3). Lastly, the ultimate goal is to not allow more than one `course_id` to exist currently, and so, a constraint was added [here](https://github.com/YourAcclaim/block_acclaim/commit/2f0e81c88ab4d65b408619da583dd1e7dbd7e8ac) to further enforce the expected behavior.

Sorry, something went wrong.
