The provided content describes a pull request that addresses a SQL injection vulnerability in the YourAcclaim/block_acclaim repository.

Root cause of vulnerability:
- Unsanitized input to the `delete_records` function, which is used to delete records from a database table.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- SQL injection vulnerability in the `delete_records` function.
- The table name was stored in a variable, which could potentially be manipulated.

Impact of exploitation:
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL commands, leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.

Attack vectors:
- By manipulating the input to the `delete_records` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- The attacker would need to be able to influence the input to the vulnerable function.

Mitigation:
- Input sanitization was implemented to prevent SQL injection.
- The table name is now hardcoded instead of being stored in a variable.
- A database constraint was added to limit the number of `course_id` entries.
