- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Inadequate checks in the `com_contact` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrect access control, allowing mail submission in disabled forms.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  A malicious actor could submit contact form data even when the form is disabled, potentially leading to spam or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a request to submit a contact form even if it is disabled.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Joomla site. The attacker does not need any special privileges or roles.
