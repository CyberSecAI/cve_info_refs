Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The lack of proper input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying Linux operating system of the affected router. This could lead to a complete compromise of the device and the network it protects.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web-based management interface of the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have administrative privileges to access the vulnerable web-based management interface of the device.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a command injection issue in the web-based management interface of specific Cisco Small Business RV Series routers. This is caused by insufficient input validation. An attacker with administrative privileges can remotely inject and execute arbitrary commands as root on the device's operating system.
