LOCKED OUT⛔ 24 hour lockout initiated

hi. we regret to inform you that a condition has occurred that has resulted in a 24 hour lockout. this occurs when rate limiting controls are exceeded or when someone attempts to hack the system but fails too many times. we wish you luck in your future attempts tomorrow.

#Unfortunately as I did not have access to the source code a lot of this couldn't really be coded. #Lot of this seems to be user specific (zoneid, dashboard etc). Virtually just taking the vulnerable request and running the exploit. #Very bare bones...wish I could've done more, but maybe someone else with access to the source would want to do that as an exercise.
