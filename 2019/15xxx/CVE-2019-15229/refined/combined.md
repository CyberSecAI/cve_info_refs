CVE-2019-15229

FuelCMS 1.4.4 and possibly before are affected by a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability in the Create Blocks section of the Admin console.  This could lead to an attacker tricking the administrator into executing arbitrary code via a specially crafted HTML page.

Viewing the Blocks section from the admin console, "No data to display":
