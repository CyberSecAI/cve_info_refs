Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of CVE-2019-15130 lies in the lack of proper input validation and access control in the Humanica Humatrix 7 Recruitment module when handling file uploads for candidate profile pictures. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication and upload arbitrary files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The application allows unauthenticated users to upload files of any type to the server.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The `WRC01_USERID` parameter, which is meant to identify a user, is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to specify any number. This allows the attacker to write to other user's directories.
*   **Lack of Authentication/Authorization:** The upload functionality does not require authentication, allowing any user to upload files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By uploading executable files (e.g., ASP or ASPX), attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The ability to upload malicious files could enable attackers to steal sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Denial of Service:** Malicious uploads could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks by filling up storage space or by crashing the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker crafts a multiple-part POST request to the vulnerable endpoint: `https://[target]/sunfish5/ehrm/humanica/recruitment_online/personalData/act_personaltab.cfm`
*   **Cookie Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `WRC01_USERID` cookie value to control the target directory where the file will be uploaded.
*   **File Upload:** The malicious file is sent as part of the POST request in the `photo` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need to authenticate to perform the attack.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the Recruitment module of Humanica Humatrix 7 versions 1.0.0.203 and 1.0.0.681.
*   The vulnerable endpoint is `https://[target]/sunfish5/ehrm/humanica/recruitment_online/personalData/act_personaltab.cfm`.
*   The attacker uses a `WRC01_USERID` cookie and a `photo` parameter to upload a file.
*   The attacker can combine this vulnerability with CVE-2019-15129 (Unauthorized Access File) to access and execute the uploaded malicious files.
