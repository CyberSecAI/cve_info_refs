Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-15921 and CVE-2019-15926 and CVE-2019-15920 from the provided texts:

**CVE-2019-15921**

*   **Vulnerability:** Memory Leak
*   **Root Cause:** A memory leak occurs in the `genl_register_family()` function within `net/netlink/genetlink.c` when `idr_alloc()` fails. Specifically, the code doesn't free the memory possibly allocated for `family->attrbuf`.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attack vector is local.
*   **Impact:** Could lead to a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.
*   **Affected Versions:** Linux kernel before 5.0.6

**CVE-2019-15926**

*   **Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Access
*   **Root Cause:** Out of bounds access exists in the `ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx` and `ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx` functions within `drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c`.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (system crash) or possibly arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Marvell wifi chip driver.

**CVE-2019-15920**

*   **Vulnerability:** Use-After-Free
*   **Root Cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists in `SMB2_read` function within `fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c` in the Linux Kernel.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local, single authentication.
*   **Impact:** The impact is listed as partial information disclosure based on CVSS v2 from NVD, but SUSE rates it with higher impacts (Complete Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) but requires local access.
*   **Affected Versions:** Linux kernel before 5.0.10

The SUSE information also includes details on affected products, fixed versions, and patch names for their enterprise Linux distributions and related products. The openSUSE information describes a security update addressing these and other vulnerabilities for openSUSE Leap 15.1.

The commit log from cdn.kernel.org doesn't mention CVE-2019-15920 or CVE-2019-15926 and is therefore unrelated to the requested CVEs.

The Netapp advisory lists CVE-2019-15921 among a list of CVEs, with no specific details other than successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS) in multiple NetApp products that incorporate the Linux Kernel.
