{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-15741",
  "attackVector": "Local",
  "rootCause": "The log directory is owned by the 'git' user, and logrotate, running as root, rotates logs within this directory without using the 'su' directive. This allows the 'git' user to manipulate the log directory and leverage a race condition in logrotate.",
  "vulnerability": "Insecure permissions and a race condition in logrotate allow a local user to escalate privileges to root.",
  "impact": "Privilege escalation from the 'git' system user to the 'root' user.",
  "attackDetails": "A local attacker with 'git' user privileges can exploit a race condition in logrotate by replacing a log directory with a symbolic link to another directory (e.g., /etc/bash_completion.d). When logrotate runs, it writes to the target directory as root, and the attacker can inject malicious code (e.g., a reverse shell) into a file in that directory. Upon root login, the malicious code is executed, granting the attacker a root shell.",
  "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker requires local access to the system with the privileges of the 'git' user.",
  "affectedVersions": "GitLab Omnibus versions 7.4 through 12.2.1",
  "remediation": "Update to GitLab Security Release: 12.2.3, 12.1.8, and 12.0.8, or change the owner and group of /var/log/gitlab to root or use the 'su' directive in the logrotate configuration file."
