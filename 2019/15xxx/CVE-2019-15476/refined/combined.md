### @carlosvini **[carlosvini](/carlosvini)** commented [Jun 12, 2019](#issue-455399689) • edited Loading

Hi,

The default behavior of Former is to use $\_GET variables to populate the form fields, If I understood correctly.

This makes a XSS attack possible because checkbox are not escaping their values.

A similar fix was made here in 2014 for hidden inputs: [5859644](https://github.com/formers/former/commit/58596440993dd09e77724e24afdbb229e227946b)

I had a hard time trying to use the right version for the tests, since there's no composer.lock, but when I got it right all tests passed.

## Steps to reproduce:

* Create new Laravel app
* Install Former through Composer
* Add code to welcome.blade.php:

  `{!! Former::checkbox('test') !!}`
* run php artisan serve
* Open URL:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/?test="><h1><i>some HTML here</i></h1>

```
## Expected behavior:

* Value would be escaped/encoded, no HTML would be rendered

## What happens:

* HTML is displayed (XSS attack)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| It seems passing the checkbox name on the $\_GET as array is also a problem, i.e. ?**name[]**=X instead of only ?**name**=X  Like: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/?test[]="><h1><i>some HTML here</i></h1>`  But this time the *label* tag has unescaped HTML. The previous mentioned problem had HTML inside the attribute *value* of the *input* tag.  I will see if I find time to make a pull request for this one too. |
