# Vulnerability

CVE-2019-15078

## Vendor

AIRDROPX BORN

## Vulnerability Type

Typo in Constructor

## Abstract

We found a vulnerability in smart contract of "XBORNID" which is an Ethereum ERC20 Token. Because there is a typo in constructor, the attacker can change the owner of the contract and able to obtain XBORNID token for free.

## Details

XBORNID is a Ethereum ERC20 Token contract. The total number of transactions submitted to this contract is 41,813, and 1,718 users holding the XBORNID token.
Moreover, the last transaction date of this contract is 8 days ago which indicates that the contract is actively being used by external users.

[![](/smsecgroup/SM-VUL/raw/master/typo-vul-00/img/figure1.png)](/smsecgroup/SM-VUL/blob/master/typo-vul-00/img/figure1.png)
*Figure 1. XBORNID Token Information*

In the constructor of the 'XBORNID' contract, there is a logic of changing owner of the contract to function caller.
Moreover, the XBORNID Tokens are assigned to owner.

```
contract XBORNID is ERC20 {
...
function XBornID() public {
   owner = msg.sender;
   balances[owner] = totalDistributed;
    }
}

```

The constructor of the XBORNID Token becomes normal `public` function due to the typo. The name of the constructor must be `XBORNID` and not `XBornID`. Because it is a `public` function, external attacker can call this function without any restriction.
By calling this function, attacker can become owner of the contract and could obtain 'XBORNID' Tokens for free and steal ether.

```
modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner);
        _;
    }

function withdraw() onlyOwner public {
        uint256 etherBalance = address(this).balance;
        owner.transfer(etherBalance);
    }

```

Also, once the attacker becomes the owner of the contract, it can bypass `onlyOwner` modifier and calls `withdraw` function to steal all the ether holds by the contract.

## Exploit

Below figure is the result of `XBornID` function. We can obtain Tokens for free and able to become owner of the contract easily.

*Figure 2. The Result of XBornID() function*

## Conclusion

The constructor name must be same as contract name or `constructor` keyword should be used by developers.
