If the code that uses libflate panics, it may trigger a use-after-free in libflate code. Since use-after-free usually poses an arbitrary code execution vulnerability, I will relay further details privately to the maintainer.

Code compiled with `panic=abort` is not affected. This can be used as a mitigation in the interim.

Affected Functions
Version
`libflate::gzip::MultiDecoder::read`

* `<0.1.25, >=0.1.14`

### Description

Affected versions of libflate have set a field of an internal structure with a generic type to an uninitialized value in `MultiDecoder::read()` and reverted it to the original value after the function completed. However, execution of `MultiDecoder::read()` could be interrupted by a panic in caller-supplied `Read` implementation. This would cause `drop()` to be called on uninitialized memory of a generic type implementing `Read`.

This is equivalent to a use-after-free vulnerability and could allow an attacker to gain arbitrary code execution.

The flaw was corrected by aborting immediately instead of unwinding the stack in case of panic within `MultiDecoder::read()`. The issue was discovered and fixed by Shnatsel.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
