{
  "CVE-2019-15925": {
    "Root cause": "A deadlock can be triggered when a thin-volume is built on a loop device and available memory is low. Process P1 allocates memory with GFP_FS flag, direct allocation fails, memory reclaim invokes memory shrinker in dm_bufio, acquiring mutex dm_bufio_client->lock. P1 then waits for dm_buffer IO completion. However, if the underlying loop device forwards the IO using direct-IO which allocates memory with GFP_KERNEL and that fails, memory reclaim will invoke the dm_bufio shrinker which will attempt to acquire the same mutex held by P1, resulting in a deadlock.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Deadlock due to ABBA lock acquisition between memory allocation and device IO"
    ],
    "Impact": "System deadlock, preventing further operations.",
    "Attack vectors": "Triggering specific memory allocation and IO conditions, specifically related to thin-volumes built on loop devices.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create thin volumes on loop devices and the ability to induce memory pressure on the system."
