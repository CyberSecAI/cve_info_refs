Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_AvccAtom::Create` function.
*   **Weakness:** The code reads a number of picture parameters (`num_pic_params`) and then iterates through them, reading a 2-byte length and then length bytes for each parameter. The check `if (cursor > payload_size)` after incrementing the cursor is not sufficient to prevent a heap overflow if `num_pic_params` is large enough as there may not be enough space left in the buffer to read a further byte.
*   **Impact:** Heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted MP4 file.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to `mp4compact`.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_RtpAtom::AP4_RtpAtom` constructor.
*  **Weakness**: The code calculates `str_size` and allocates `str_size+1` bytes. However, `str_size` is derived by subtracting `AP4_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE + 4` from the atom's size. If the size of the atom is exactly `AP4_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE + 4`, `str_size` becomes zero. A zero-length string is allocated, and then at `str[str_size] = '\0'`, a write occurs one byte beyond the allocated memory.
*   **Impact:** Heap-buffer-overflow, leading to potential crashes.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted MP4 file.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to `mp4compact`.

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-buffer-overflow in `AP4_AvccAtom::AP4_AvccAtom` constructor.
*   **Weakness:**  The code reads `num_pic_params` from the payload, then iterates through picture parameters, reading a 2-byte length for each parameter. Before this loop it checks if `cursor+2 <= payload_size`. However, after reading a byte for `num_pic_params` there isn't a check to ensure that there is enough space in the buffer to read the two bytes for the length of the first param.
*   **Impact:** Heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to crashes.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted MP4 file.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file as input to `mp4compact`.
