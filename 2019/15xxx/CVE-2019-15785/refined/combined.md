```

`warn_script_unsaved` is declared as `bool`, but prefs.c:1230 casts its pointer to `int *`, leading the issue above. Prefs of type `pr_bool` should be int as well, FontForge is pre-C99 and does not know `bool`.

### Type of change

This is correct due to the cast, but in [another issue](https://github.com/fontforge/fontforge/issues/3512#issuecomment-509553312) we agreed that using C99 features is OK, so `bool` is OK as long as it doesn't break anything. `-fsanitize=address` is a good idea in that regard.

# FontForge: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202004-14**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in FontForge, the worst of
which could result in the arbitrary execution of code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **media-gfx/fontforge** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20200314** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20200314** |

### Background

FontForge is a PostScript font editor and converter.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in FontForge. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted font
using FontForge, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All FontForge users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=media-gfx/fontforge-20200314"

```
