      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability occurs because `warn_script_unsaved` is declared as `bool`, but `prefs.c` casts its pointer to `int *` when loading preferences from file. This is because FontForge predates C99 which introduced the `bool` type.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Type mismatch when reading boolean preference data, leading to out-of-bounds write"
        ],
        "impact": "A global buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Opening a specially crafted font file or preferences file."
        ],
       "required_capabilities": [
          "Ability to entice a user to open a specially crafted font/preference file"
