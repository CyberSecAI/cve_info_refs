Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in WPS Hide Login v1.5.2.2, as described in the first document:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The plugin attempts to hide the default WordPress login page by redirecting users. However, it contains multiple flaws in its logic, allowing attackers to bypass this protection. These flaws stem from insufficient input validation and insecure checks on URL parameters and referrers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Protection Bypass #1:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Access to the login page is granted if the URL contains `action=confirmaction`, regardless of other checks.
    *   **Code Location:** `/classes/plugins.php`, line 427
2.  **Protection Bypass #2:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Access to the login page is granted if the URL contains the `adminhash` parameter.
    *   **Code Location:** `/classes/plugins.php`, lines 477-480
3.  **Protection Bypass #3:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** If WooCommerce is active, access to the login page is granted by using `action=rp&key&login` in the URL.
    *   **Code Location:** `/classes/plugin.php`, lines 653-656
4.  **Protection Bypass #4:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Access to the login page can be gained by sending a POST request with a crafted "Referer" header containing "wp-login.php"
    *   **Code Location:** `/classes/plugin.php`, line 563
5. **Default Parameter Usage**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The plugin uses "login" as a default value for the login URL, making it easier to guess the login path
    *   **Code Location:** `/classes/plugin.php`
6.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** By triggering the hook `wps_hide_login_signup_enable` with a specific URL a fatal error occurs disclosing the server path.
    *  **Code Location:** `/classes/plugin.php`, line 498

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Attackers can bypass the intended login page hiding functionality.
*   Attackers can access the login page and attempt brute-force attacks on user credentials.
*   Attackers can gain sensitive path information through the full path disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Manipulating URL parameters in HTTP GET requests.
*   Crafting HTTP POST requests with a specific "Referer" header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker does not need to be logged in or have any special privileges.
*   The attacker only needs to send HTTP requests.

The second document is the plugin page on wordpress.org. It does not contain specific vulnerability information for the version mentioned in the first document but provides a general description of the plugin, its functionality and some user reviews. It also confirms that the vulnerabilities were fixed in version 1.5.3.

The changelog also lists "Fix : Security vulnerabilities (Thanks @juliobox)" for version 1.5.3 which confirms that the vulnerabilities were patched in this version.

This information is more detailed than a simple CVE description and identifies multiple specific vulnerabilities in the plugin code.
