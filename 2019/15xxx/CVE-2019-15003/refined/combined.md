**Platform notice: Server and Data Center only.** This article only applies to Atlassian products on the Server and Data Center platforms.

Support for Server\* products **ended on February 15th 2024**. If you are running a Server product, you can visit the [Atlassian Server end of support](https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud "https://www.atlassian.com/migration/assess/journey-to-cloud") announcement to review your migration options.

*\*Except Fisheye and Crucible*

## Problem

Affected Jira Service Management versions in CVE-2019-15003 will allow non-application access users - Service Management Customers to see restricted information in the Jira instance.

This allows Service Management Customers who normally don't have access to Jira information, this authorization bypass allows remote attackers with portal access to gain direct access to Jira with the same permissions.

This affects Jira Service Management portals that have the "Anyone can email the service project or raise a request in the portal" setting enabled, exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance.

## Affected versions

* All versions **before** 3.9.17
* 3.10.x
* 3.11.x
* 3.12.x
* 3.13.x
* 3.14.x
* 3.15.x
* 3.16.x **before** 3.16.11 (the fixed version for 3.16.x)
* 4.0.x
* 4.1.x
* 4.2.x **before** 4.2.6 (the fixed version for 4.2.x)
* 4.3.x **before** 4.3.5 (the fixed version for 4.3.x)
* 4.4.x **before** 4.4.3 (the fixed version for 4.4.x)
* 4.5.x **before** 4.5.1 (the fixed version for 4.5.x)

Permanent resolution below along with workarounds if immediate upgrade is not possible

## Resolution

Upgrade to fixed version of Jira Service Management

* 3.9.17
* 3.16.11
* 4.2.6
* 4.3.5
* 4.4.3
* 4.5.1

## Workaround

Block authorization bypass.

### Workaround 1.

Redirect requests to Jira containing jspa, jspx, jsp to a safe URL

1. Add the following to the `<urlrewrite>` section of `[jira-installation-directory]/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/urlrewrite.xml`:

   ```
   <rule>
       <from>(?s)/servicedesk/.*\.jsp.*</from>
       <to type="temporary-redirect">/</to>
   </rule>
   ```
2. Save the `urlrewrite.xml`
3. Restart Jira

### Workaround 2.

Block requests to Jira for authorization bypass at the reverse proxy or load-balancer level

#### Apache

1. Add the following into the .conf file that contains the virtualhost that proxies to Jira

   ```
   <LocationMatch "/servicedesk/.*\.jsp.*">
      Order Allow,Deny
       Deny from  all
   </LocationMatch>
   ```

   example below -

   ```
   <VirtualHost *:80>
       ServerName jira.example.com

       ProxyRequests Off
       ProxyVia Off

       <Proxy *>
            Require all granted
       </Proxy>
       ProxyPass /jira  http://ipaddress:8080/jira
       ProxyPassReverse /jira  http://ipaddress:8080/jira

       <LocationMatch "/servicedesk/.*\.jsp.*">
        Order Allow,Deny
        Deny from  all
       </LocationMatch>

    </VirtualHost>
   ```
2. Restart your Apache proxy

#### Nginx

1. Add the following into the .conf file that contains the server block that proxies to Jira inside location block

   ```
   if ($uri ~* "/servicedesk/.*\.jsp.*"){ return 403;}
   ```

   example below -

   ```
       location /jira {
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Server $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
           proxy_pass http://ipaddress:8080/jira;
           client_max_body_size 10M;

   		if ($uri ~* "/servicedesk/.*\.jsp.*"){ return 403;}
    }
   ```
2. Restart your NGINX

## Summary

* Our Support team will help with workarounds and bug reporting
* We'll generally fix critical bugs in the next maintenance release
* We schedule non-critical bugs according to a variety of considerations

 [Report a bug](https://support.atlassian.com/contact/)

Developing an app (add-on) for an Atlassian product or using one of our APIs? Report any related bugs in our [Ecosystem](https://ecosystem.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) Jira.

**On this page:**

Bug reports

Atlassian Support is eager and happy to help verify bugs—we take pride in it! Create an issue in our [support system](http://support.atlassian.com), providing as much information as you can about how to replicate the problem you're experiencing. We'll replicate the bug to verify, then lodge the report for you. We'll also try to construct workarounds if possible.

## Search existing bug reports

Use our [public issue tracker](https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/Dashboard.jspa?selectPageId=10440) to search for existing bugs, add your report, and watch the ones that are important to you. When you watch an issue, we'll send you an e-mail notification when the issue's updated.

## How we approach bug fixing

Bug fix releases are more frequent than feature releases, and target the most critical bugs affecting customers. The notation for a bug fix release is the final number in the version (the 1 in 6.0.1, for example).

We assess each bug based on the symptom severity (that is, when this bug causes symptoms, how severe are those symptoms). There are three levels of symptom severity.

### Severity 1 - Critical

Your application is unavailable. Users aren't able to perform their job function, and no workarounds are available.

See some examples...

* login failure affecting all users
* all or most pages don't display
* out of memory errors cause application failure
* significant data loss
* node communication failures
* administration tools fail.

### Severity 2 - Major

A feature is unavailable, application performance is significantly degraded, or users job functions are impaired.

See some examples...

* the application performs slowly and fails intermittently
* application is functional, but frequently used gadgets or macros don't work
* application links fail
* specific editing features fail
* or a Severity 1 (critical) issue where there is a viable workaround.

### Severity 3 - Minor

The application or specific feature isn't working as expected, but there is a workaround available. Users experience is impacted, but their job function is not impaired.

See some examples...

* some searches fail
* sections of pages load slowly
* administrative features fail intermittently, but a workaround is available
* visual defects, that don't affect function
* minor translation or localization problems
* keyboard shortcuts not functioning as expected.

Assessing bugs using symptom severity makes sure that we prioritise the most impactful fixes. We give high priority to [security issues](https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/bug-fix-policy).

## About our bug fix workflow

If you watch or mark a bug as affecting your team, it’s useful to understand how we review, prioritize, and resolve them in our public issue tracker [jira.atlassian.com](https://jira.atlassian.com).

We prioritize issues using a metric called User Impact Score (UIS), which is individually calculated for every issue. It takes into account the number of affected users, the severity of the issue, recent interest, and the percentage of users affected per instance. The higher the UIS score, the more pervasive and severe the issue is.

We have also standardised our workflow statuses across Data Center products to make it easy for you to see where an issue is at. Here’s the current workflow, and a description of each status.

![](/support/files/201294573/1180147451/1/1667327165629/image2022-11-1_14-26-4.png)

| **Workflow status** | **Definition** | **Phase** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Needs triage** | This issue is waiting to be reviewed by a member of the Atlassian product team. Typically, only recently created issues are in this status. Our product teams review these issues regularly. | **Review** |
| **Gathering impact** | This issue has been reviewed, but needs more supporting information to gauge how pervasive the problem is. | **Prioritization** |
| **Long term backlog** | A fix for this issue is required, but planned for farther in the future. This is because it’s not as severe or pervasive as other issues. |  |
| **Short term backlog** | A fix for this issue is required, and will be prioritised in the near future. This is because it’s more severe or pervasive than other issues. |  |
| **Ready for development** | A fix for this issue is required, and is ready for the development team to start their implementation. |  |
| **In progress** | The development team is currently working on this issue. | **Implementation** |
| **In review** | A fix for this issue has been proposed and is being reviewed and quality-tested by the development team. |  |
| **Waiting for release** | A fix for this issue has been implemented and is waiting to be shipped in a release. |  |
| **Closed** | Work on this issue is complete. If it’s fixed, the resolution will be ‘Fixed’ and the Fix Version field will indicate the product version that contains the fix. If no code changes were required, the resolution will be ‘Duplicate', 'Won't fix', 'Handled by support', 'Timed out', or similar. | **Closure** |

## How to get access to bug fixes

To get access to bug fixes you will need to upgrade to a release that contains the fix.

## Release terminology for Data Center products

* **Platform release** (example: 4.0) contains significant or breaking changes. For example changes or removal of existing APIs, significant changes to the user experience, or removal or a major feature.
* **Feature release** (example: 4.6) can contain new features, changes to existing features, changes to supported platforms (such as databases, operating systems, Git versions), or removal of features. These were previously referred to as 'major' releases by most products.
* **Bugfix release** (example: 4.6.2) can contain bug fixes and stability and performance improvements. Depending on the nature of the fixes they may introduce minor changes to existing features, but do not include new features or high-risk changes, so can be adopted quickly. We recommend regularly upgrading to the latest bugfix release for your current version. These were previously referred to as 'maintenance' releases by most products.

In addition to the three main release types, a feature release can also be designated a **Long Term Support release**(formerly known as an Enterprise release), which means it will receive bug fixes for a longer period of time than a standard feature release.

### Long Term Support releases

Long Term Support releases (formerly known as Enterprise releases) are for Data Center customers who prefer to allow more time to prepare for upgrades to new feature versions but still need to receive critical bug fixes. If you only upgrade to a new feature version about once a year, a Long Term Support release may be a good fit for your organization. For Jira Software, Confluence, Bitbucket, and Bamboo we will:

* Designate a feature release as a Long Term Support release, at least every 12 months.
* Backport critical security fixes, as outlined in our current security bug fix policy, and fixes relating to stability, data integrity, or critical performance issues.
* Make bug fix releases available for the designated version until it reaches end-of-life.
* Provide a change log of all changes between one Long Term Support release and the next to make upgrading easier.

Not all bug fixes will be backported. We'll target the bugs and regressions that we deem most critical, focusing on stability, data integrity, or performance issues. There may also be some fixes that we choose not to backport due to risk, complexity, or because the fix requires changes to an API, code used by third-party apps (also known as add-ons), or infrastructure that we would usually reserve for a platform release.

For Jira Software Data Center customers, we'll endeavor to allow zero downtime upgrades between one Long Term Support release and the next Long Term Support release, but can't guarantee that downtime will not be required, depending on the nature of the changes. The change log will indicate if a zero downtime upgrade will be available.

In the example below, version 4.2 has been designated a Long Term Support release. The number of bug fix releases and timing illustrated below is just an example, your product's release cadence may differ.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

### **Authorization bypass allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-15003**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed by **any attacker with portal access\*** who exploits an authorization bypass. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.

All versions of Jira Service Desk before 3.9.17, from 3.10.0 before 3.16.11, from 4.0.0 before 4.2.6, from 4.3.0 before 4.3.5, from 4.4.0 before 4.4.3, and from 4.5.0 before 4.5.1 are affected. This issue can be tracked here: <https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/JSDSERVER-6590>

**\* Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service Desk portals that have the [Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-939926273.html)[setting](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-939926273.html) enabled. Changing this permission does not remove the vulnerability to an exploit by an attacker that has portal access. Atlassian does not recommend changing the permission, instead please read-on and follow the instructions outlined in the section:**

#### Acknowledgements

We would like to acknowledge [Raphaël Arrouas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphaelarrouas/) for discovering this vulnerability.

#### **Mitigation**

If you are unable to upgrade Jira Service Desk immediately or are in the process of [migrating to Jira Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/cloud-migration), then as a **temporary workaround**, you can:

* [Block requests to Jira containing jspa, jpsx, jsp at the reverse proxy or load balance level](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirakb/workaround-for-cve-2019-15003-979411903.html), or
* Alternatively, configure Jira to redirect requests containing jspa, jspx, jsp to a safe URL
  + Add the following to the `<urlrewrite>` section of `[jira-installation-directory]/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/urlrewrite.xml`:

    ```

    ```
    ```
    <rule>
        <from>/servicedesk/.*\.jsp.*</from>
        <to type="temporary-redirect">/</to>
    </rule>
    ```
    ```

    ```
  + After saving the changes above, [restart Jira](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/start-and-stop-jira-applications-938847802.html)

After upgrading Jira Service Desk this mitigation can be removed.

### **URL path traversal allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-15004**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

### Description

### **Authorization bypass allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-15003**

#### **Severity**

Atlassian rates the severity level of this vulnerability as **critical**, according to the scale published in [our Atlassian severity levels](https://www.atlassian.com/security/security-severity-levels). The scale allows us to rank the severity as critical, high, moderate or low.

This is our assessment and you should evaluate its applicability to your own IT environment.

#### **Description**

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed by a remote attacker with portal access who exploits authorization bypass. Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service Desk portals that have the "**[Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal"](https://confluence.atlassian.com/servicedeskserver/managing-access-to-your-service-desk-939926273.html) setting** enabled. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.

**Which versions are affected?**

All versions of Jira Service Desk before 3.9.17, from 3.10.0 before 3.16.9, from 4.0.0 to 4.0.3, from 4.1.0 to 4.1.3, from 4.2.0 before 4.2.6, from 4.3.0 before 4.3.5, from 4.4.0 before 4.4.3, and from 4.5.0 before 4.5.1 are affected by this vulnerability.

**Mitigation**

Refer to the [Jira KB](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRAKB/Workaround%2Bfor%2BCVE-2019-15003) for more information on these workarounds.

Description:

By design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to
raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer
portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed
by a remote attacker with portal access who exploits a path traversal
vulnerability. Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service
Desk portals that have the Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request
in the portal setting enabled. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all
issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could
include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software
projects.
Versions of Jira Service Desk Server and Data Center all versions before 3.9.17
(the fixed version for 3.9.x), from version 3.10.0 before 3.16.10 (the fixed
