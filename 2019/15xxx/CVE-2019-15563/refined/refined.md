**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the OHDSI WebAPI application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  The application was vulnerable to SQL injection. This means that an attacker could insert malicious SQL code into input fields, which would then be executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this SQL injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Access sensitive data within the database.
    - Modify or delete data in the database.
    - Potentially gain control of the database server.
    - The provided documents do not contain details about the specific data at risk or the extent of potential access/control that could be gained.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through input fields of the WebAPI application where SQL queries are constructed using user-supplied data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable input fields of the WebAPI application. The content does not provide information on the level of access (e.g., unauthenticated, authenticated user) needed to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
