Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-15266:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied input within command-line parameters that handle filenames in Cisco Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue (CWE-22). This means an attacker can use directory traversal techniques (e.g., "../") in the filename parameters to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to view system files that should be restricted. These files may contain sensitive information, potentially exposing the system's security configuration or other confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device. The attack is performed via the command-line interface (CLI).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system, requiring high privileges ("PR:H" in CVSS).
*   **Local Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to execute commands on the affected device.

**Summary of Key Points:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco WLC software releases earlier than 8.10.
*   The vulnerability allows a local attacker with high privileges to read sensitive files.
*   There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to fix this vulnerability in release 8.10 and later.

**CVSS Score:**

*   The CVSS v3 base score is 4.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating:
    *   Attack Vector (AV): Local
    *   Attack Complexity (AC): Low
    *   Privileges Required (PR): High
    *   User Interaction (UI): None
    *   Scope (S): Unchanged
    *   Confidentiality Impact (C): High
    *   Integrity Impact (I): None
    *   Availability Impact (A): None
