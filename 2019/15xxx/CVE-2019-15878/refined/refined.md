  "CVE-2019-15878": {
    "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate FreeBSD. FreeBSD version 11.3 is susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "root_cause": "The SCTP layer does improper checking when an application tries to update a shared key. Therefore an unprivileged local user can trigger a use-after-free situation, for example by specific sequences of updating shared keys and closing the SCTP association.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS). Triggering the use-after-free situation may result in unintended kernel behavior including a kernel panic.",
