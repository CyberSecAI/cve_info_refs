Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities in the WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) plugin:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The plugin's AJAX action `admin-common-settings` is accessible to unauthenticated users (`wp_ajax_nopriv_`), despite the subsequent function `run()` checking for admin privileges.
*   Lack of nonce verification within the `run()` function, which is meant to prevent CSRF attacks.
*   The plugin saves the `admin_email` GET input without sanitization.
*   The `admin_email` setting is displayed without escaping, leading to potential XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Due to the lack of nonce verification, an attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into unknowingly changing plugin settings by crafting a malicious request.
*  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Because the admin_email setting is not sanitized before being saved and not escaped when being displayed, a malicious user could inject JavaScript code into the setting, leading to XSS when an admin views the settings page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker can modify the plugin's settings, potentially causing unauthorized changes or disruptions. In this case, they can change the admin email.
*   **XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the admin settings, which can then be executed when an admin views the settings page. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, data theft, or further compromising the WordPress installation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker could craft a malicious link or form that, when clicked or submitted by a logged-in administrator, would trigger the vulnerable AJAX action and change plugin settings.
*   **XSS:** An attacker would craft a malicious URL with JavaScript in the `admin_email` parameter, and trick the admin to visit the URL. Once set, the malicious script would be executed when the administrator accesses the settings page in the backend.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CSRF:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. The attacker does not need access to the WordPress backend.
*   **XSS:** The attacker needs to be able to entice the administrator to visit a crafted URL and be able to view the admin settings page.

**Additional Information**

*   The plugin uses a custom CSRF token system, but it's not used correctly for AJAX requests. Instead of utilizing WordPress's built-in nonce system, it uses user metadata for CSRF tokens, which are updated every time `checkCSRF` is called, even if the form is not submitted.
*   The vulnerability was found in the `SPDSGVOCommonSettingsAction` class, specifically the `listen()`, `run()`, and `checkCSRF()` functions.
*   The proof of concept provided demonstrates how an attacker can exploit the XSS vulnerability by injecting JavaScript code via the `admin_email` parameter.
*   The provided content is more detailed than a standard CVE description.
