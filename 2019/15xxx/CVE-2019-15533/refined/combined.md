### @aNullValue **[aNullValue](/aNullValue)** commented [Jul 16, 2019](#issue-468921717)

This code is wholly and entirely untested. Make sure that it does what you intend, etc. Even if you don't merge this request, please do not leave the code vulnerable to sql injection, in production.

Sorry, something went wrong.
