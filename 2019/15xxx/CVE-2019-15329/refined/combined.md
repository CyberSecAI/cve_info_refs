### **Basics**

* Import users and customers from a CSV easily
* And also extra profile information with the user meta data (included in the CSV with your custom fields)
* Just upload the CSV file (one included as example)
* All your users will be created/updated with the updated information, and of course including the user meta
* Autodetect delimiter compatible with `comma ,`, `semicolon ;` and `bar |`
* Export users and customers choosing delimiters and using some filters
* Create a cron task to do the import periodically in order to integrate WordPress with an external system
* Interaction with lots of other plugins like WooCommerce, BuddyPress, Paid Membership Pro, WooCommerce Memebership, WooCommerce Subscriptions and many others
* Import users from frontend using a shortcode

### **Usage**

Once the plugin is installed you can use it. Go to Tools menu and there, there will be a section called *Insert users from CSV*. Just choose your CSV file and go!

### **CSV generation**

You can generate CSV file with all users inside it, using a standar spreadsheet software like: Microsoft Excel, LibreOffice Calc, OpenOffice Calc or Gnumeric.

You have to create the file filled with information (or take it from another database) and you will only have to choose CSV file when you “Save as…” the file. As example, a CSV file is included with the plugin.

### **Some considerations**

Plugin will automatically detect:

* Charset and set it to **UTF-8** to prevent problems with non-ASCII characters.
* It also will **auto detect line-ending** to prevent problems with different OS.
* Finally, it will **detect the delimiter** being used in CSV file

Please read documentation before start using this plugin.

## FAQ

### Columns position

You should fill the first two columns with the next values: Username, Email.

The next columns are totally customizable and you can use whatever you want. All rows must contains same columns. User profile will be adapted to the kind of data you have selected. If you want to disable the extra profile information, please deactivate this plugin after make the import.

### id column

You can use a column called id in order to make inserts or updates of an user using the ID used by WordPress in the wp\_users table. We have two different cases:

* If id doesn’t exist in your users table: WordPress core does not allow us insert it, so it will throw an error of kind: invalid\_user\_id
* If id exists: plugin check if username is the same, if yes, it will update the data, if not, it ignores the cell to avoid problems

### Passwords

We can use a column called “Password” to manage a string that contains user passwords. We have different options for this case:

* If you don’t create a column for passwords: passwords will be generated automatically
* If you create a column for passwords: if cell is empty, password won’t be updated; if cell has a value, it will be used

### Serialized data

Plugin can import serialized data. You have to use the serialized string directly in the CSV cell in order the plugin will be able to understand it as an serialized data instead as any other string.

### Lists

Plugin can import lists as an array. Use this separator: :: two colons, inside the cell in order to split the string in a list of items.

### WordPress default profile data

You can use those labels if you want to set data adapted to the WordPress default user columns (the ones who use the function wp\_update\_user)

* user\_nicename: A string that contains a URL-friendly name for the user. The default is the user’s username.
* user\_url: A string containing the user’s URL for the user’s web site.
* display\_name: A string that will be shown on the site. Defaults to user’s username. It is likely that you will want to change this, for both appearance and security through \* obscurity (that is if you don’t use and delete the default admin user).
* nickname: The user’s nickname, defaults to the user’s username.
* first\_name: The user’s first name.
* last\_name: The user’s last name.
* description: A string containing content about the user.
* jabber: User’s Jabber account.
* aim: User’s AOL IM account.
* yim: User’s Yahoo IM account.
* user\_registered: Using the WordPress format for this kind of data Y-m-d H:i:s.

### Multiple imports

You can upload as many files as you want, but all must have the same columns. If you upload another file, the columns will change to the form of last file uploaded.

### Export

You can export a file with all your users data using “Export” tab. There you will be able to find some filters and options to prepare your export.

### Hooks: actions and filter

It just exports an empty CSV when selecting a user role without a date range. Does not work.

I have been using this plugin for almost two years. It helps a lot when I need regularly export user info for auditing. Especially, it can export customized user metadata, not just the default ones. The importing feature is also versatile for bulky update on existing users.
This plugin is straight forward, very easy to use. Most of all, it is reliable, and the developer is easy to reach when I encountered an issue. Bugs are fixed in a few days, and the plugin is periodically updated and improved.
