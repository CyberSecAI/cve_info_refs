The native feed code direct from Facebook causes the loading animation to loop and the feed never loads if a user is logged in to their FB account as per several support threads that seem to go unanswered by Meta.
This plugin fixed that for me.
Only four stars because it is not responsive.

After trying the free version of this plugin, I decided to purchase the pro version. However, my experience has been very disappointing as I was only able to use the same features that were available in the free version. The rest just didn’t work, and to make matters worse, this premium plugin caused problems on my website, forcing me to uninstall it to get it working properly again.
I have tried to claim a refund through PayPal, but have received no response so far. I want to warn you not to install the pro version as it will not work as expected and you may lose your paid money. It’s really frustrating to feel cheated like this.

One of the websites I manage was infected thanks to this plugin. It’s probably not intentional damage, but poor plugin security. Don’t use it.

Nothing works, the App, the support videos do not match version being used, and direct support team ignore you when faced with a problem they cannot resolve.
Asked for money back but ignored.

Maybe this layout makes sense to someone but not to me. I had to input information, reload the page – and nothing. There was no shortcode generated and no information about how to proceed. Instead, there were pages of options with “available on pro” in grey text across them. It’s like someone uploaded a PDF and called it a plugin. Absolute waste of time.
