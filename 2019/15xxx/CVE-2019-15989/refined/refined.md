## CVE-2019-15989

The content provided relates to CVE-2019-15989.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of a BGP update message that contains a specific BGP attribute.

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect processing of a malformed BGP update message. The specific malformed attribute is a non-transitive attribute.

**Impact:** An unauthenticated, remote attacker could send crafted BGP update messages to an affected system, causing the BGP process to restart unexpectedly, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability affects only Interior BGP (iBGP) as the malformed attribute would be dropped at Autonomous System (AS) boundaries and could not be transmitted through Exterior BGP (eBGP).

**Attack Vector:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker sends a BGP update message containing a specific, malformed BGP attribute to a vulnerable Cisco IOS XR Software device.

**Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be a configured, valid BGP peer, or be able to inject the malicious BGP update message into the victimâ€™s BGP network on an existing, valid TCP connection to a BGP peer.

**Affected Products:** Cisco devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software and configured for BGP. This affects both Cisco IOS XR 32-bit and 64-bit software.
