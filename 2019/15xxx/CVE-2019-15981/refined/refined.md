Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15981:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the SOAP API of Cisco DCNM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path traversal vulnerability (CWE-22) in the SOAP API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can read, write, or execute arbitrary files on the affected system with full administrative privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is conducted remotely through the SOAP API.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated and have administrative privileges on the DCNM application.
- A crafted request is sent to the API to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the Cisco DCNM application.
- The attacker needs network access to the affected DCNM instance.
- The attacker must be able to craft specific requests to the SOAP API.

**Additional notes:**
- This CVE is related to other path traversal vulnerabilities in Cisco DCNM, specifically CVE-2019-15980 (REST API) and CVE-2019-15982 (Application Framework).
- Proof-of-concept exploit code is available.
- There are no known workarounds; upgrading to Cisco DCNM software release 11.3(1) or later is recommended.
- The severity of the path traversal vulnerabilities is aggravated by the authentication bypass vulnerabilities detailed in another advisory related to Cisco Data Center Network Manager (cisco-sa-20200102-dcnm-auth-bypass), which was published simultaneously.
