Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from passing user-controlled parameters directly to the `Terrasoft.Core.DB.Column.Const()` method within the bpm'online CRM-System SDK. This method appears to be constructing SQL queries, and the lack of proper sanitization of user input leads to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to SQL injection attacks. The `Column.Const()` method is vulnerable because it directly incorporates user-provided input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The article doesn't explicitly state the impact, but standard SQL injection vulnerabilities could lead to:
    - Data breaches: An attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database.
    - Data manipulation: An attacker could modify or delete data, compromising the integrity of the system.
    - System compromise: In severe cases, an attacker might be able to execute operating system commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious SQL code through user-controlled parameters passed to the vulnerable `Column.Const()` method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to influence the input parameters that are used by the `Column.Const()` method. This would typically involve interacting with the application through user interfaces or API calls.
- The attacker likely needs some knowledge of the application's structure and how it utilizes the `Column.Const()` method.

**Additional Details:**
- The article mentions that the vendor, Terrasoft, did not provide a patch and instead shifted responsibility to the developers by altering the documentation.
- The recommended mitigation is to avoid using `Column.Const()` and switch to `Column.Parameter()`, which should properly sanitize input.
