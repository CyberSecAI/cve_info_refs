## Package

cargo

slice-deque
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.2.0

## Patched versions

0.2.0

## Description

Affected versions of this crate entered a corrupted state if mem::size\_of::() % allocation\_granularity() != 0 and a specific allocation pattern was used: sufficiently shifting the deque elements over the mirrored page boundary.

This allows an attacker that controls controls both element insertion and removal to corrupt the deque, such that reading elements from it would read bytes corresponding to other elements in the deque. (e.g. a read of T could read some bytes from one value and some bytes from an adjacent one, resulting in a T whose value representation is not meaningful). This is undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected by using a pair of pointers to track the head and tail of the deque instead of a pair of indices. This pair of pointers are represented using a Rust slice.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

using a Rust slice.

## Description

![@aldanor](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2418513?v=4&size=48)[aldanor](https://github.com/aldanor)opened [on Dec 3, 2018](https://github.com/gnzlbg/slice_deque/issues/57#issue-386620997)

This took me a long while to figure out, but I narrowed it down to just a single line:

```
println!("{:?}", queue);
queue.pop_front();
println!("{:?}", queue);
```

The elements are simple Clone/Copy structs; the first println outputs the queue in its normal state, whereas in the second all values are like 4294999990 or 123145302343606. This only happens in a quickcheck-like test suite where the queue is used super intensively, and pushes/pop are done thousands of times (it constantly fails at the same spot though).

I could try running it through valgrind if it helps, not sure how else I could help. Is this a known issue perhaps?
