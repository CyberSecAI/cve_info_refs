{
  "CVE-2019-15847": {
    "Description": "The POWER9 backend in GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) before version 10 could optimize multiple calls of the __builtin_darn intrinsic into a single call, thus reducing the entropy of the random number generator. This occurred because a volatile operation was not specified. For example, within a single execution of a program, the output of every __builtin_darn() call may be the same.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `__builtin_darn` intrinsic was not marked as volatile, allowing the compiler to perform optimizations that reduced the randomness of the output.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect optimization of a hardware random number generator leading to reduced entropy.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Reduced entropy in the output of the `__builtin_darn` intrinsic. This could lead to predictability in applications using this intrinsic to generate cryptographic keys or other security-sensitive values.",
     "Attack vectors": "Exploitation can occur through network if the application using DARN is generating cryptographic keys or otherwise acting upon a value received from the network.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to compile code using vulnerable versions of GCC, and then execute said code or have it execute in a victim's machine."
