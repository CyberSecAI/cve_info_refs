Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper handling of user-supplied input within the "User Description" field in the user administration pages of ManageEngine Endpoint Central. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or encode HTML-like text entered into this field.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **HTML Injection:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to HTML injection. When a user enters text that resembles HTML tags into the description field, the application interprets these tags instead of treating them as plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The HTML injection can lead to unwanted changes in the user data displayed or stored. The document indicates the texts were altered based on the tags in the description, leading to unexpected modifications of the created user data. This could potentially be used to deface the user interface, inject malicious scripts, or perform other actions depending on the context of where the user description is used.
  
**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The attack vector is through the user interface in the user administration pages. An attacker (or a user with malicious intent) would enter crafted text containing HTML tags into the "User Description" field while creating or modifying user accounts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the user administration section of ManageEngine Endpoint Central. This likely requires the attacker to have user creation or modification permissions.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was released on 04-Nov-2019.
- The document provides a fix by instructing users to download and install the latest PPM (Patch Program Module) to update their installation.
