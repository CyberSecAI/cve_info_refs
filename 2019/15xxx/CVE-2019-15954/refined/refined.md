Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15954:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied input when creating widgets in Totaljs CMS. Specifically, the CMS evaluates Javascript code embedded within a custom `<script>` tag with the `total` attribute, leading to code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authenticated Code Injection:** An authenticated user with the "widgets" privilege can inject arbitrary code into the system via malicious widget creation.
- **Server-Side Javascript Evaluation:** The server-side evaluation of Javascript code from the specially crafted `<script>` tag allows for execution of malicious code on the server.
- **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allows attackers to escape the sandbox environment using the `global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec()` function, which leads to remote code execution (RCE).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server running the Totaljs CMS. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Widget Creation:** The primary attack vector involves creating a malicious widget within the Totaljs CMS admin panel.
- **Malicious Payload:** The malicious Javascript payload is embedded within a `<script total>` tag within the widget's source code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the "widgets" privilege within the Totaljs CMS.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text includes an example payload to demonstrate the exploitation: `<script total>global.process.mainModule.require('child_process').exec('RCE here');</script>`
- The vulnerability affects Totaljs CMS version 12.0
