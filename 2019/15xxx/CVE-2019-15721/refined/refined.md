- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control allows group maintainers to edit group runners, even though they are not supposed to have this permission according to the UI and recent changes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Inconsistent permissions between UI and backend logic
    - Lack of proper authorization checks when accessing the runner edit page directly.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Group maintainers can modify existing group runners, potentially disrupting CI/CD pipelines or gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Direct navigation to the runner edit page using the Runner ID.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Must be a group maintainer.
    - Must know the Runner ID, which can be found by accessing CI/CD settings page within any project under the affected group.
