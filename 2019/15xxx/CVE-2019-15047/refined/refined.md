The provided content describes two potential heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities in Bento4 version 1.5.1.0, as identified by fuzzing.

**Vulnerability 1:** AP4\_BitReader::SkipBits@Ap4Utils.cpp-548

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `AP4_BitReader::SkipBits` function at Ap4Utils.cpp-548.
*   **Weakness:** The `SkipBits` function reads beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, the AddressSanitizer (ASan) output shows a READ of size 4 at an address located just outside a 44-byte region allocated for `AP4_DataBuffer`.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted AAC file using the `mp42aac` tool. The command line used is `mp42aac @@ a.aac`.
*   **Impact:** The impact of this vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Details from ASan:**
    *   The overflow occurs during a read operation within the `AP4_BitReader::SkipBits` function.
    *   The memory region involved is allocated by `AP4_DataBuffer::ReallocateBuffer`.
    *   The ASan report provides a call stack leading to the vulnerability.

**Vulnerability 2:** AP4\_Dec3Atom::AP4\_Dec3Atom@Ap4Dec3Atom.cpp-97

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `AP4_Dec3Atom::AP4_Dec3Atom` function at Ap4Dec3Atom.cpp-97.
*   **Weakness:** The `AP4_Dec3Atom` constructor reads beyond the allocated buffer. The ASan output shows a READ of size 1 at an address located just outside a 15-byte region allocated for `AP4_DataBuffer`.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted AAC file using the `mp42aac` tool with the command line `mp42aac @@ a.aac`.
*   **Impact:** The impact is a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to a crash or arbitrary code execution.
*   **Details from ASan:**
    *   The overflow occurs during a read operation within the `AP4_Dec3Atom` constructor.
    *   The memory region involved is allocated by `AP4_DataBuffer`.
    *   The ASan report provides a call stack leading to the vulnerability.

Both vulnerabilities are triggered using the same `mp42aac` tool and a malformed AAC file. They both result in heap-buffer-overflows. The provided information includes the source code locations of the vulnerabilities, command-line arguments to trigger them, and full ASan reports, including call stacks and memory allocation details. Links to the input files (POC) are also provided.
