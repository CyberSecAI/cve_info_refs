Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-15120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Kunena forum extension's BBCode parsing functionality. Specifically, the BBCode parser does not adequately prevent the injection of malicious HTML/JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. Malicious code can be injected via BBCode.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject and store malicious JavaScript code within the forum database through a crafted BBCode tag. This JavaScript code is then executed in the browsers of users who view the affected forum topic.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE):** As stated by one of the sources, while the primary vulnerability is XSS, it can be leveraged further to achieve RCE on the affected server. The specific mechanism is not detailed in this content.
*   **User compromise:** An attacker can potentially hijack user sessions, steal cookies, or redirect users to malicious sites.
*   **Data manipulation or theft:** The attacker could potentially modify or steal data within the context of the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **BBCode Input:** The attack vector is through a crafted BBCode tag within any user-submitted content that gets parsed by the vulnerable BBCode parser (e.g., topic titles, posts, or other fields that use BBCode).
*   **Stored XSS:**  The malicious code is stored in the forum's database and triggered each time a user views the affected content, meaning the attacker does not have to directly interact with each victim.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Forum Access:** The attacker requires the ability to post or submit content within the affected Kunena forum.
*   **Understanding of BBCode:** The attacker needs knowledge of how BBCode works and how to craft a malicious payload within a BBCode tag.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Kunena versions 5.0.x through 5.1.14.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Andrey Skuratov of FBK CyberSecurity.
*   A fix was implemented in Kunena version 5.1.14.
*   The XSS is only triggered if the affected post is the latest one in the topic.
*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit is provided: `[spoiler="qwe<script>alert('PWNED!')</script>"]rty[/spoiler]`
*   There's a video demonstration of the stored XSS leading to RCE.
