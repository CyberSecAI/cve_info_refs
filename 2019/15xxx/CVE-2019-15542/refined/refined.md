Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2019-15542.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of uncontrolled recursion during the serialization of HTML DOM trees.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled recursion: The `ammonia` crate used recursion for serializing HTML DOM trees.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker could provide a pathologically nested input, causing a stack overflow and leading to program termination (abort). This results in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The attack can be initiated remotely over a network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability. They simply need to supply a maliciously crafted, deeply nested HTML input to the affected function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of the `ammonia` crate prior to 2.1.0.
- The vulnerability is present in the `ammonia::Document::to_string`, `ammonia::Document::write_to` and `ammonia::clean` functions.
- The fix involves changing the serialization from a recursive approach to an iterative one to prevent stack overflows.
