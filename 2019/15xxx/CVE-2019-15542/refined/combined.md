* feature: add `UrlRelative::RewriteWithRoot`

* chore: remove unnecessary dependency on third-party `matches!` macro

# 3.1.3

* fix: incorrect FF/CR handling in `clean_text`
* fix: split class name attribute by all ASCII whitespace, not just SP 0x20
* docs: fix incorrect English in `is_html` documentation

# 3.1.2

* fix: unexpected namespace switches can allow XSS via svg/mathml parsing

# 3.1.1

* fix: Crash on invalid URLs in some configurations ([issue #136](https://github.com/rust-ammonia/ammonia/issues/136))

# 3.1.0

* feature: Whitelist generic attribute prefix

* Updated to [rust-url 2.0](https://docs.rs/url/2.0.0/url/).
* Updated to the 2018 edition.

# 2.1.4

* fix: split class name attribute by all ASCII whitespace, not just SP 0x20 (backported from 3.1.3)

# 2.1.3

* fix: unexpected namespace switches can allow XSS via svg/mathml parsing (backported from 3.1.2)

# 2.1.2

* Fix a memory leak caused by certain node types.

# 2.1.1

* Update dependencies

# 2.1.0

* Bump minimum supported Rust version to 1.30.
* Fix a potential DoS attack from pathologically nested input.

# 2.0.0

* Add "script" and "style" to the default set of [clean content tags](https://docs.rs/ammonia/2.0.0/ammonia/struct.Builder.html#method.clean_content_tags)
* Make all iterator-accepting APIs use `IntoIterator` and `Borrow`, so that you can pass slices directly to them.

# 1.2.0

* Recognize `action`, `formaction` and `ping` as [URL attributes](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#attributes-3) for scheme and origin filtering
* Add [`Builder::url_filter_map`](https://docs.rs/ammonia/1.2/ammonia/struct.Builder.html#method.url_filter_map) which allows URLs, both relative and absolute, to be pre-filtered

# 1.1.0

* Add [`Builder::clean_content_tags`](https://docs.rs/ammonia/1.1/ammonia/struct.Builder.html#method.clean_content_tags) which allows elements to be removed entirely instead of just having the tags removed

# 1.0.1

* Update dependencies

# 1.0.0

* Breaking change: The `Ammonia` struct is now called `Builder` and uses that pattern for better forward compatibility
* Breaking change: The `Builder::clean()` method now returns a `Document` struct instead of a `String`. You can use the `Document::to_string` method to obtain a `String`.
* Breaking change: `keep_cleaned_elements` has changed from being an off-by-default option to the only supported behavior
* Breaking change: Using a tag with `allowed_classes` means that the class attribute is banned from `tag_attributes` (it used to be required)
* Breaking change: The default set of allowed elements and attributes was expanded
* Added support for reading the input from a stream
* Added `UrlRelative::Custom`, allowing you to write your own relative URL resolver
* Changed `UrlRelative::RewriteWithBase` take a custom URL. This made the `url` crate a public dependency.
* Added `id_prefix`, which can be used to avoid element `id` collisions with the rest of the page
* Added property getters to `Builder`, to see what everything is currently set to
* Added property modifiers, to change the existing whitelist (instead of completely replacing it)

# 0.7.0

* Add `allowed_classes`, allowing the user to set only specific items that can go in the class attribute

# 0.6.1

* Fix a bug in the traversal code

# 0.6.0

* Resolve relative URLs with a given base (off by default, you need to specify that base URL)
* Add `rel="noreferrer noopener"` to links, as a security measure
* Avoid closing void tags, such as turning `<br>` into `<br></br>`
* Bump the html5ever version
* Switch to using docs.rs to host docs

# 0.5.0

* Bump html5ever to 0.18 (this updates serde from 0.9 to 1.0)

# 0.4.0

* Upgrade to html5ever 0.17

# 0.3.0

* Add an option to keep elements that had attributes removed

# 0.2.0

* Removed the strip option. Not a security problem, but it was wrong and looked stupid. I'm not going to reintroduce this until html5ever allows me to preserve the original text enough to have non-stripped tags come out exactly like they go in.
* Treat the data attribute of object as a URL. In non-default configurations, this could have been a leak.
* Update to the newest html5ever.

### Description

Affected versions of this crate did use recursion for serialization of HTML
DOM trees.

This allows an attacker to cause abort due to stack overflow by providing
a pathologically nested input.

The flaw was corrected by serializing the DOM tree iteratively instead.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
