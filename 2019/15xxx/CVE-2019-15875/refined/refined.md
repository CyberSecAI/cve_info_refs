- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect initialization of a stack data structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A flaw exists in the kernel where stack data is not properly initialized before a core dump is created, leading to potential disclosure of kernel data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Up to 20 bytes of sensitive kernel data, previously stored on the stack, can be disclosed to a crashing user process.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user can trigger a process crash, leading to the creation of a core dump containing the leaked kernel data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user capable of crashing a process.
