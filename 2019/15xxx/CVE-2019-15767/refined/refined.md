{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `cmd_load` function in `frontend/cmd.cc` of gnuchess does not properly handle the case where a loaded file lacks a newline character. When parsing a file without newlines, if the filename is too long, the `while` loop in the `cmd_load` function continues to copy data beyond the intended buffer, causing a stack buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A crafted EPD file, when loaded, can overwrite parts of the stack, including the base pointer and the return address. This can potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious EPD file with a long filename and no newlines in the file's contents. When the user loads the crafted file through the `load` command, the buffer overflow occurs.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted EPD file to the gnuchess application, typically by having the user execute the `load` command with the malicious file as input."
