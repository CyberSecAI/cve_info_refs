## FAQ

### Do you support older WordPress versions?

Version 6.x.x should support WP versions 4.0 and up. Version 4.7.0 should support WP versions 2.3 – 4.0.

Since WordPress is constantly changing, this plugin will always strive to support the latest version of WordPress. As there are many security vulnerabilities reported, please always keep WordPress as up-to-date as possible.

Unfortunately, we do not support older versions of WordPress or the non-current release of this plugin.

### How do I change the WordPress update notification e-mail?

Go to the General tab in our settings. You can enter a single email address, or multiple if you comma-separate them.

### Automatic Updates

### How Do I Enable Logging?

Check out our video on how logs work.

### Does Easy Updates Manager work with third-party plugins and themes?

Since third-party providers use custom update mechanisms, we cannot always guarantee that they will work with Easy Updates Manager. Most will, but there are a number of common mistakes that plugin authors can make.

I’ve been using Easy Updates Manager for a month, and it works great. I’ve not had any issues on all four sites that I have installed it on.

## Changelog

#### 9.0.19 – 2024-11-12

* FIX: Misreporting of plugin’s update statuses in notification emails, which were labeled “success” instead of the appropriate designation of “failed”
* TWEAK: Improve the strategy for using an associative array to filter option default values, aiming to safeguard existing defaults from removal and to prevent the introduction of non-relevant options
* TWEAK: The notification email should omit any “failed” update status for plugins, themes and translations if they lack the corresponding name and/or version number
* TWEAK: Improve updates-check anonymisation and randomisation, stripping out further unnecessary data

#### 9.0.18 – 2024-07-10

* FIX: Couldn’t reactivate plugins due to plugin dependency issues (Premium)
* TWEAK: Allow auto-updates event from other plugins to take place only if it’s in the same exact schedule with the auto-updates scheduling feature

* TWEAK: Split multiple sentences into separate translation calls.

#### 9.0.15 – 2023-04-13

* TWEAK: Improve MPSUM\_Logs::normalise\_call\_stack\_args() method to reduce the size of call stacks being stored in the database, also to prevent silent termination due to size of the call stacks that swell

* TWEAK: Add a user capabilities check when receiving a request through the `wp_ajax_eum_ajax` handler

#### 9.0.13 – 2022-06-07

* TWEAK: Update logs are sent separately causing a huge number of emails being sent to the user (Premium)

#### 9.0.11 – 2021-12-08

* FIX: Change the order (priority) of auto\_update\_plugin/theme filters to make the ‘Safe Mode’ feature (Premium) work properly
* TWEAK: Improve the way errors are handled before and after a plugin activation takes place (deactivated plugins must be reactivated immediately regardless of whether or not the plugins contain a fatal error)
* TWEAK: Change use of ‘$’ to local/function scope, to prevent conflicts

#### 9.0.10 – 2021-09-28

* FIX: Inconsistent behaviour of the ‘manually update’ option of the plugin updates setting (it updated plugins to their major/minor version that shouldn’t have happened)

* TWEAK: Bump PHP requirement to 5.6+

#### 9.0.5 – 2020-08-10

* TWEAK: Some minor code improvements based on PHPCS analysis
* TWEAK: Updated seasonal notices
* TWEAK: Add WP 5.5 support. Since EUM’s update management facilities are much more sophisticated than WP 5.5’s new “automatic upgrades” user-interface additions, the new WP 5.5 options do not map simply onto existing EUM options. Thus the only way they can work together is if EUM replaces those additions with links back to the EUM controls.

#### 9.0.4 – 2020-04-27

* FEATURE: Allow “every 3 hours” and “every 6 hours” options for the update frequency checks

#### 9.0.3 – 2020-04-14

* FIX: Auto-backup (Premium) feature disabled whilst an issue that could cause it to continually repeat is investigated

* FIX: Prevent Force Updates from deactivating plugins.
* FIX: (Premium feature) UpdraftPlus will now take a backup during an auto-update

* FIX: Delayed updates were delaying automatic updates to WordPress core when no delay was requested
* TWEAK: Divi theme can now be auto-upgraded.
* TWEAK: Bump required WP version from 4.6 to 4.7. We’ve not introduced anything to make it incompatible so it will likely still work; but this is the support requirement.

#### 8.1.1 – 2019-10-23

* FIX: Fixed uninstall script error when deleting the plugin.

#### 8.1.0 – 2019-10-08

* TWEAK: Automatic update emails are only sent once every twenty four hours.

#### 8.0.5 – 2019-03-28
