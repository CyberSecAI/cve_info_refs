# Low: Unlikely SQL injection through schemaName or tableName

## Package

npm

connect-pg-simple
([NPM](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 6.0.1

## Patched versions

6.0.1

## Description

### Impact

An unlikely SQL injection if the case of an unsanitized table name input.

### Patches

The user should upgrade to `6.0.1`. Due to its low impact a backport has not been made to the `5.x` branch.

### Workarounds

If there is no likelihood that the `tableName` or `schemaName` options sent to the constructor could be of an unsanitized nature, then no workaround is needed. Else the input could be sanitized and escaped before sending it in. Take note though that such an escaping would need to be removed when upgrading to `6.0.1` or later, to avoid double escaping.
