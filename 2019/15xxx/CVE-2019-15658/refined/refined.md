Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `tableName` or `schemaName` options when passed to the constructor of the `connect-pg-simple` library. This allows for potential SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `tableName` or `schemaName` input parameters if they are not properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into the `tableName` or `schemaName` parameters. The impact is "unlikely" and "low" as stated, implying exploitation is possible if the input is not sanitized.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `tableName` or `schemaName` options passed to the constructor. The attacker has to control these options to inject SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be in a position to control the `tableName` and/or `schemaName` options passed to the `connect-pg-simple` constructor. This could mean compromising a system or application that uses this library, and injecting malicious input into these parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of `connect-pg-simple` prior to `6.0.1`.
- The fix was introduced in version `6.0.1`.
- The advisory explicitly states that if the `tableName` or `schemaName` inputs are always sanitized, no workaround is needed, otherwise input sanitization is recommended, but needs to be removed when upgrading to `6.0.1` to prevent double escaping.
- The advisory notes the severity as "low" due to the "unlikely" nature of the injection happening, depending on how the application is used.
- The advisory explicitly states that there is no known CVE ID associated with it, and that there are no CWEs associated with it.
