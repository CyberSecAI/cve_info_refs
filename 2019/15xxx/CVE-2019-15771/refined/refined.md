Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the insecure handling of AJAX requests within multiple WordPress plugins developed by NicDark (now Endreww) and in the Simple 301 Redirects – Addon – Bulk Uploader plugin. Specifically:

*   **NicDark Plugins:** These plugins register `nopriv_` AJAX actions that are intended for importing WordPress settings. These actions lack proper authentication and authorization checks.
*   **Simple 301 Redirects - Addon - Bulk Uploader:** This plugin has a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users to upload a CSV file containing redirect rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated AJAX Actions:** The NicDark plugins expose AJAX actions that can be triggered by unauthenticated users (visitors not logged in to the WordPress site).
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** These AJAX actions do not properly sanitize or validate the data being processed, allowing for the modification of sensitive settings like `siteurl`.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The Simple 301 Redirects plugin does not properly validate the uploaded CSV file allowing the attacker to inject malicious redirect rules.
*   **Insecure Import Functionality:** The plugins use import functionalities that are not secured against malicious input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Website Redirection:** Attackers can modify the `siteurl` setting of the victim site, causing all the site's scripts to load from a path controlled by the attacker.
*   **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript into the victim’s site by controlling the loaded script path, which can be used for various purposes such as phishing, malware distribution, etc.
*   **Traffic Hijacking:** In the case of the Simple 301 Redirects vulnerability, attackers can redirect all site traffic to malicious websites through CSV file injection.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** By controlling the website's scripts, attackers can gain more control of the website, which may lead to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct AJAX Requests:** Attackers send crafted AJAX requests to vulnerable endpoints exposed by the plugins. This can be done without authentication.
*   **Malicious CSV Upload:** Attackers upload a specially crafted CSV file to the vulnerable Simple 301 Redirects plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers do not need to log in to the WordPress site; the vulnerabilities are exploitable by any visitor.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs only network access to the vulnerable website to send the malicious AJAX requests or upload the CSV.
*   **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker requires a basic understanding of how to make AJAX requests and/or how to upload files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The threatpost.com article mentions that the attacks are actively ongoing and that the redirect domains used by the attackers change.
*   The WordPress.org plugin page for ND Shortcodes includes user reports of errors, including security vulnerabilities in older versions.
*   The article also lists other plugins that were vulnerable to similar attacks, such as Woocommerce User Email Verification, Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer, Coming soon and Maintenance Mode and Blog Designer, suggesting a widespread issue.
