Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-15789:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   MicroK8s, prior to version 1.15.3, allowed any local user with access to the host to deploy pods to the underlying Kubernetes installation. This was due to insufficient access control on the Kubernetes API, allowing low-privileged users to interact with it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** Low-privileged users could directly interact with the Kubernetes API without proper authorization checks.
*   **Privileged Container Deployment:**  The lack of restrictions on pod deployment allowed a low-privileged user to create a privileged container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** By deploying a privileged container, an attacker could gain root access to the underlying host system. This could be achieved by mounting the host's root filesystem into the container and modifying critical system files such as `/etc/sudoers`.
*  **Full System Compromise:** With root access, the attacker could have full control over the host, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the host running MicroK8s. This means they must already have a user account on the system, but it does not require administrative or root privileges.
*   **Kubernetes API Exploitation:** The attacker leverages the MicroK8s functionality to deploy a malicious pod to the Kubernetes API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the host machine running MicroK8s.
*   **Basic Kubernetes Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to create and deploy a pod with a privileged container.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in MicroK8s version 1.15.3 by restricting access to the Kubernetes API to privileged users, requiring the use of `sudo` or membership in the `microk8s` group to execute MicroK8s commands.
*   The fix also included changes to the permissions of critical files and directories, especially around certificates and credentials, to prevent unauthorized access.
* The vulnerability could also be achieved by exploiting the default configuration of Istio which enabled privileged containers.
