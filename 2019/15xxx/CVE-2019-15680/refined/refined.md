Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15680:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a null pointer dereference within the `HandleZlibBPP` function in TightVNC's vncviewer code. This occurs because the result of a memory allocation using `malloc` is not checked before being used. If `malloc` fails to allocate the requested memory (e.g., due to a large allocation size), it returns a null pointer. The code then attempts to dereference this null pointer, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is the lack of a check on the return value of the `malloc` function, resulting in a null pointer dereference when memory allocation fails.
*   **Missing Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling for memory allocation failures.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability results in a denial of service, as the application crashes due to the null pointer dereference.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The vulnerability is exploitable via network connectivity, implying that an attacker can trigger it by sending specially crafted data to the vulnerable VNC viewer.
*  **VNC Viewer/Client:** The vulnerability exists in the VNC client, which means the attack vector involves the client connecting to a malicious server or receiving manipulated data from a server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the VNC server/client.
*   **Malicious Server/Manipulated Data:** The attacker needs to either set up a malicious VNC server or be in a position to manipulate the data being sent to the VNC client.
*   **Understanding of VNC Protocol:** An understanding of the VNC protocol is necessary to craft malicious packets that trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is in the client-side code of TightVNC's viewer.
*   The `HandleZlibBPP` function is involved in handling compressed data, suggesting that the crafted packets may need to involve zlib compression.
*   The issue was reported by a security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.
* The vulnerability was addressed in `libvncserver` package updates, as shown in the Ubuntu security notice (USN-4407-1).
* Siemens confirms the vulnerability in their advisory SSA-478893.
