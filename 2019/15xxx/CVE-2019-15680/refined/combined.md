                 CVE-2019-15681
Debian Bug     : 945364

Several vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in TightVNC 1.x, an
X11 based VNC server/viewer application for Windows and Unix.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in rfbserver.c in TightVNC
    server did not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of
    ClientCutText data, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message
    that was processed by using a single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2018-7225

    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2019-8287

    TightVNC code contained global buffer overflow in HandleCoRREBBP
    macro function, which could potentially have result in code
    execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

    (aka CVE-2018-20020/libvncserver)

CVE-2018-20021

    TightVNC in vncviewer/rfbproto.c contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop
    vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to consume
    an excessive amount of resources like CPU and RAM.

CVE-2018-20022

    TightVNC's vncviewer contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper
    Initialization vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed
    attackers to read stack memory and could be abused for information
    disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could be used to
    leak stack memory layout and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2019-15678

    TightVNC code version contained heap buffer overflow in
    rfbServerCutText handler, which could have potentially resulted in
    code execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

    (partially aka CVE-2018-20748/libvnvserver)

CVE-2019-15679

    TightVNC's vncviewer code contained a heap buffer overflow in
    InitialiseRFBConnection function, which could have potentially
    resulted in code execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable
    via network connectivity.

    (partially aka CVE-2018-20748/libvnvserver)

CVE-2019-15680

    TightVNC's vncviewer code contained a null pointer dereference in
    HandleZlibBPP function, which could have resulted in Denial of System
    (DoS). This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

CVE-2019-15681

    TightVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could have been abused
    for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it
    could have been used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This
    attack appeared to be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.9-6.5+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tightvnc packages.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.Ô¨Årst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciÔ¨Åc to the customer‚Äôs
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deÔ¨Åned by the customer to accomplish Ô¨Ånal scoring.

An additional classiÔ¨Åcation has been performed using the CWE classiÔ¨Åcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiÔ¨Åcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Subject: libvnc and tightvnc vulnerabilities

Hello,

LibVNC is a cross-platform library to implement programs that use RFB (remote frame buffer protocol). Although, on its Github page (<https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver>) it is stated that libvnc is designed to implement server-side software, it also has functionality to implement a VNC client. Due to the fact that many ICS vendors use open source VNC products I would like to drag some attention to the VNC products because they have some problems that should be fixed asap.

During recent research of libvnc I managed to discover few vulnerabilities (11 in total) which affect products that are using libvncserver and libvncclient (<https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+author%3Apaulcher>). There are a couple of issues left to the next release of libvnc (<https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/milestone/4>), but the packages, that I have recently reviewed still didn't patch vulnerabilities that were found quite some time ago. Meanwhile, an issue that has been found by @ateska (<https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/211>) is critical, affects VirtualBox and probably every multithreading VNC server that is based on libvnc and it is still not patched after almost a year.

At first, I thought that these issues were inside the code that was written by libvnc developers, by this wasn't exactly the case. Some of them (i.e. buffer overflow inside heap structure in CoRRE handler <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/250>) were inside vulnerable code written by AT&T Laboratories in 1999 and got copy-pasted by many software developers (you can see it by trying to find HandleCoRREBPP function in Github search), as well by LibVNC and TightVNC  developers. LibVNC contributors managed to fix all security issues that I have reported to them so far. Also I tried to report these vulnerabilities in TightVNC software version 1.3.10 (which is used, for example, in latest Ubuntu "xtightvncviewer" package) to GlavSoft company, who are authors of the TightVNC software:

```
1. global buffer overflow in corre.c
    In `vnc_unixsrc/vncviewer/corre.c` inside the `HandleCoRREBPP` function global buffer overflow occurs due to the lack of size check.
    `buffer` is defined in rfbproto.c:96 as ```char buffer[640*480];```. Inside `HandleCoRREBPP` function data is being read to the buffer `ReadFromRFBServer(buffer, hdr.nSubrects * (4 + (BPP / 8))` where `hdr.nSubrects` is 32-bit unsigned integer controlled by remote user.

2. heap buffer overflow in rfbServerCutText handler
    Heap buffer overflow in `rfbServerCutText` handler inside `HandleRFBServerMessage` happens due to the malloc argument unsigned integer overflow on line rfbproto.c:1220. Suppose msg.sct.length equals 0xffffffff, then `malloc(msg.sct.length+1);` = `malloc(0);` will allocate small heap chunk of size 0x10. But `msg.sct.length` = 0xffffffff bytes may be read in this chunk on line 1222 (`ReadFromRFBServer(serverCutText, msg.sct.length)`).

3. heap buffer overflow in InitialiseRFBConnection function
    Heap buffer overflow `InitialiseRFBConnection` function happens due to the malloc argument unsigned integer overflow on line rfbproto.c:307. Because of the integer overflow `malloc` function will allocate small heap chunk of size 0x10 and 0xffffffff bytes will be read into the chunk by ReadFromRFBServer function.

4. null-ptr dereference in `zlib.c`
    Because malloc result is not checked after allocation on line zlib.c:56 null pointer dereference is possible if malloc argument is too big and malloc fill fail to allocate memory Allocation of raw buffer : `raw_buffer = (char*) malloc( raw_buffer_size );`, next usage of raw_buffer is on line 68
```

But GlavSoft representative politely declined to patch the 1.X version of TightVNC software, because it doesn't bring any income to the company. They are currently developing TightVNC 2.X, which is not affected by GPL licenses in third-party code. This is the exact answer of the GlavSoft representative (in Russian):

–ö —Å–æ–∂–∞–ª–µ–Ω–∏—é, –∫–∞–∫ –∫–æ–º–º–µ—Ä—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –Ω–∞–º —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –Ω–µ—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç–∞–±–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞—Ç—å—Å—è TightVNC 1.x, —Ç.–∫. –æ–Ω–æ —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∏—Ç —á—É–∂–æ–π GPL-–∫–æ–¥ –∏ –ø–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É –º—ã –Ω–µ –∏–º–µ–µ–º –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ª–∞–≥–∞—Ç—å —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –∫–æ–¥ –ø–æ–¥ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º–∏ –ª–∏—Ü–µ–Ω–∑–∏—è–º–∏. –ê —Ç–µ—Ö–ø–æ–¥–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∫–∞ –≤ —Å–ª—É—á–∞–µ —Å TightVNC –Ω–∏–∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—Å–∏–ª–∞ –Ω–∞–º —Å–∫–æ–ª—å-–Ω–∏–±—É–¥—å —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ—Ö–æ–¥–∞. –ü–æ—ç—Ç–æ–º—É, —É–≤—ã, –≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ 1.x –Ω–∞–º —Å–æ–≤—Å–µ–º –Ω–µ–∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω—ã.

That being said, package maintainers should probably patch these vulnerabilities by themselves if they want to continue supporting TightVNC 1.X packages in their repositories.

These bugs are so obvious and I still cannot believe that they haven't been already found by anyone else. So please tell me if these issues have been already discovered before, but remained unpatched for some reason.
