| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1154091#c0)  Guillaume GARDET   2019-10-15 14:43:07 UTC  ``` While trying to build some binaries using openCV libs, I get the following error with Leap 15.1 and 15.2 (x86 and ARM):  [  464s] make[2]: *** No rule to make target 'opencv_calib3d-NOTFOUND', needed by 'tests/ArmnnExamples'.  Stop. [  464s] make[2]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....  Tumbleweed is fine.  It looks like this patch is missing: <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/9656/files>  Please note that openCV is coming from SLE, so the update/fix should go through SLE. ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1154091#c2)  Michael Gorse   2019-10-16 19:58:37 UTC  ``` 3.3.1 already has that patch. <https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull//10299> is the patch that we're missing. I see that graphics/mjpg-streamer is failing to build on leap with a similar error, and I am able to get it to build in a vm if I apply that patch. Anyway, I am going to submit it to SLE along with a couple of CVE fixes. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154091#c5)  Ludwig Nussel   2019-12-03 12:49:50 UTC  ``` looks like this is fixed now? ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1154091#c6)  Guillaume GARDET   2019-12-03 13:20:50 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ludwig Nussel from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1154091#c5)) > looks like this is fixed now?  Not at all, there is no SR for openCV to Leap:15.2.

Debian Bug     : 886282 885843 875342 872044 872043

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenCV, the Open
Computer Vision Library. Buffer overflows, NULL pointer dereferences and
out-of-bounds write errors may lead to a denial-of-service or other
unspecified impact.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.9.1+dfsg1-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your opencv packages.

For the detailed security status of opencv please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/opencv>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
