## CVE-2019-15910

The content describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in ASUS HG100, MW100, WS-101, TS-101, AS-101, MS-101, DL-101 devices using ZigBee PRO.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability stems from an insecure ZigBee network discovery procedure.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
The vulnerability lies in the insecure "discover ZigBee network procedure" which can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service attack.

### Impact of exploitation
By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can disrupt the ZigBee network, preventing end devices and routers from transmitting messages correctly. Users lose control over these devices, leading to a denial of service.

### Attack vectors
The attack involves sending Beacon request packets to obtain the ZigBee network's personal area network (PAN) identifier and extended PAN identifier. The attacker then sends fake beacon packets with the same PAN identifier but a different extended PAN identifier. This causes the coordinator to detect a PAN identifier conflict and change its PAN identifier. Since the end devices and routers are unaware of this change, they continue sending packets to the old PAN identifier.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker needs the following:
1.  A laptop with Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.
2.  Atmel RZ Raven USB sticks (2.4 GHz dongle).
3.  KillerBee (with modifications to the API).
4.  Zigdiggity.
5.  Wireshark.

The attacker needs to be within range of the ZigBee network to send and receive ZigBee packets.
