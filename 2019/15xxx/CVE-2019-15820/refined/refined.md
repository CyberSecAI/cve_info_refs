Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-15820:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `lolmi_save_settings` function within the Login or Logout Menu Item plugin lacked proper security measures. Specifically, it did not implement capability checks or a security nonce.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unauthenticated options change:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for any unauthenticated user to modify the plugin's settings via the `lolmi_save_settings` function.
*   **Missing capability check:** The function doesn't verify if the user has the necessary permissions to modify settings.
*   **Missing security nonce:** The function does not validate the request origin with a nonce making it vulnerable to CSRF.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing attacks:** Attackers could change the login URL to a malicious website, tricking users into entering their credentials on a fake login page.
*   **Redirection to malicious sites:** By modifying the redirect URLs, attackers could redirect users to arbitrary sites after logging in or out, potentially exposing them to further attacks or malware.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a POST request to the server with modified `lolmi_login_page_url`, `lolmi_login_redirect_url`, and `lolmi_logout_redirect_url` parameters, to the vulnerable `lolmi_save_settings` function.
*   No authentication is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   An attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit this vulnerability.
*   They need to be able to send a POST request to the server.

**Additional details from the blog post:**

*   The vulnerable plugin version is 1.1.1 and below.
*   The vulnerability was reported to WordPress.org on August 4, 2019.
*   The blog post includes a code snippet showing the vulnerable `lolmi_save_settings` function.
