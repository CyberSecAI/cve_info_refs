Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) frames that pass through the data plane of affected Cisco Aironet Access Points (APs).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper validation of GRE frames within the PPTP VPN packet processing functionality.
- Reintroduction of previously patched vulnerability CVE-2018-0234.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can cause an internal process of the targeted AP to crash, leading to a device reload.
- The AP reload results in a denial of service (DoS) condition for clients associated with the affected AP.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.
- Exploitation involves associating with a vulnerable AP, initiating a PPTP VPN connection to an arbitrary PPTP VPN server.
- Attacker sends a malicious GRE frame through the AP's data plane.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be within wireless range of a vulnerable AP to associate with it.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability, implying that the attacker need not have credentials to initiate the attack.
- Ability to establish a PPTP connection and craft malicious GRE packets

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a reintroduction of CVE-2018-0234
- Affected Products:
    - Aironet 1810 Series APs
    - Aironet 1830 Series APs
    - Aironet 1850 Series APs
- No workarounds are available, requiring software updates to fix the issue.
- Cisco has released free software updates to address the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
