# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-2515-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org

Package        : csync2
Version        : 2.0-8-g175a01c-4+deb9u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-15523

It was discovered that csync2, a cluster synchronization tool, did
not correctly check for the return value from GnuTLS security
routines. It neglected to repeatedly call this function as required
by the design of the API.

For Debian 9 "Stretch", this problem has been fixed in version
2.0-8-g175a01c-4+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your csync2 packages.

For the detailed security status of csync2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/csync2>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
