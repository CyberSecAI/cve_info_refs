Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `filemgr.php` file of Artica Integria IMS version 5.0.86.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files through the `index.php?sec=wiki&sec2=operation/wiki/wiki&action=upload` endpoint. This indicates a lack of proper file validation and sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution on the server. This is because an attacker can upload malicious files (e.g., PHP scripts) and execute them.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attack can be carried out remotely.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The attack vector is through the arbitrary file upload vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable `index.php?sec=wiki&sec2=operation/wiki/wiki&action=upload` endpoint of the application.
*   No specific authentication or authorization bypass is mentioned, meaning that if the vulnerable endpoint is accessible without restrictions the attacker could be unauthenticated, otherwise the attacker will require valid user credentials.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability CVE-2019-15091 in Artica Integria IMS 5.0.86 allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files due to improper file handling within `filemgr.php`. This can lead to code execution on the server, posing a significant security risk.
