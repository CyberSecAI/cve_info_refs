  "CVE-2019-15166": {
    "description": "lmp_print_data_link_subobjs() in print-lmp.c in tcpdump before 4.9.3 lacks certain bounds checks.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to missing bounds checks in the `lmp_print_data_link_subobjs()` function within `print-lmp.c`. This function handles the printing of data link subobjects within the Link Management Protocol (LMP) and lacks proper validation on the size and type of these subobjects before processing, leading to a potential buffer over-read.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer over-read",
         "Missing bounds checks"
      ],
      "impact": "The missing bounds checks could potentially lead to a buffer overflow or over-read. This could lead to denial of service or potentially arbitrary code execution",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network traffic analysis (pcap file)",
        "Processing of a malicious network capture (pcap file) containing crafted LMP packets"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": [
         "Ability to craft and send malicious network packets",
         "Ability to create a malicious pcap file"
      ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability exists in the handling of Link Management Protocol (LMP) packets, specifically in the parsing and printing of data link subobjects. An attacker could exploit this by creating a malformed pcap file, causing tcpdump to attempt to access memory locations outside of the buffer in `lmp_print_data_link_subobjs()`, potentially leading to a crash or other undefined behavior."
