Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15625:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Trend Micro Password Manager stores sensitive information such as IDs and passwords in plaintext in memory under certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Exposure (CWE-200):**  The application fails to properly protect sensitive data by keeping it unencrypted in memory, making it accessible through memory scans.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker with the ability to scan the memory of a system running the vulnerable Password Manager can retrieve sensitive information like login credentials.
- This access can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and other sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker must have local access to the system where the vulnerable Password Manager is running.
- **Memory Scan:** The attacker needs to perform a memory scan to extract the plaintext credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local access** to the target machine, possibly with low privileges
- Ability to perform a **memory scan**
- User account on the system, or some form of administrative access could also be used
