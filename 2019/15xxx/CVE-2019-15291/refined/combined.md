Subject: Linux kernel: multiple vulnerabilities in the USB subsystem x2

Hi!

I've previously reported vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel USB
drivers on this list [1] found with syzkaller [2]. The USB fuzzing
project has been on hold for a while, but has been resumed earlier
this year. Here's a new bunch of 15 CVEs.

As an experiment this time I've requested CVEs for 2 bugs
(CVE-2019-15290, CVE-2019-15291) that haven't yet been fixed (fixes
for the other 13 bugs are in the upstream kernel). Both have been
reported by syzbot over 4 months ago. I've made sure that these 2 bugs
are reproducible with a crafted USB device and crash a Linux laptop
(or rather crash the USB worker thread) with one of the distro
kernels.

There are many more still not fixed bugs shown here [3].

Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    Hui Peng and Mathias Payer reported that the ath6kl wifi driver
    did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead to a
    null pointer derefernce.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15217

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the zr364xx mdia driver did not
    correctly handle devices without a product name string, which
    could lead to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service
    (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15291

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the b2c2-flexcop-usb media
    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the af9005
    media driver if the device fails to respond to a command.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19037

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not
    correctly handle directories with holes (unallocated regions) in
    them.  An attacker able to mount arbitrary ext4 volumes could use
    this to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2019-19051

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the i2400m
    wimax driver if the software rfkill operation fails.  The security
    impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19052

    Navid Emamdoost discovered a potential memory leak in the gs_usb
    CAN driver if the open (interface-up) operation fails.  The
    security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19056, CVE-2019-19057

    protocol implementation that could lead to a null pointer
    dereference.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-19332

    The syzkaller tool discovered a missing bounds check in the KVM
    implementation for x86, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to use KVM could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-19447

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem driver did not safely
    handle unlinking of an inode that, due to filesystem corruption,
    already has a link count of 0.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary ext4 volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19523

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free bug in the adutux
    USB driver.  An attacker able to add and remove USB devices could

CVE-2019-19537

    The syzkaller tool discovered race conditions in the USB stack,
    involving character device registration.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19767

    The syzkaller tool discovered that crafted ext4 volumes could
    trigger a buffer overflow in the ext4 filesystem driver.  An
    attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19947

    It was discovered that the kvaser_usb CAN driver was missing
    initialisation of some structures, which could leak sensitive
    information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-19965

    Gao Chuan reported a race condition in the libsas library used by
    SCSI host drivers, which could lead to a null pointer dereference.

                 CVE-2019-19966

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap and stack buffer
    overflows in the libertas wifi driver.  On systems using this
    driver, a malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could
    use these to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash) or possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-15098

    driver did not properly validate USB descriptors, which could lead
    to a null pointer dereference.  An attacker able to add USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-15505

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the technisat-usb2 media driver
    did not properly validate incoming IR packets, which could lead to
    a heap buffer over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.
    A local user permitted to configure a wifi interface could use
    this to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-17052, CVE-2019-17053, CVE-2019-17054, CVE-2019-17055,
CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

# CVE-2019-9506

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9503.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9511.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9506 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9506)

#### Description

The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and does not prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This allows practical brute-force attacks (aka "KNOB") that can decrypt traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing.

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18809](/security/CVE-2019-18809))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-19965](/security/CVE-2019-19965))

It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in

certain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-20096](/security/CVE-2019-20096))

Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel

when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations

before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-5108](/security/CVE-2019-5108))

It was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while

destroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-7053](/security/CVE-2020-7053))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Affected Products:
openSUSE Leap 15.0
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has 48 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.0 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-15291: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the flexcop\_usb\_probe function in the
drivers/media/usb/b2c2/flexcop-usb.c driver (bnc#1146540).
- CVE-2019-14821: An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the way Linux
kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation.
It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm\_coalesced\_mmio' object,
wherein write indices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be
supplied by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or
process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could have used this flaw to
crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially
escalating privileges on the system (bnc#1151350).
- CVE-2017-18595: A double free might have been caused by the function
allocate\_trace\_buffer in the file kernel/trace/trace.c (bnc#1149555).
- CVE-2019-9506: The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including
version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and did not
prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This
allowed practical brute-force attacks (aka "KNOB") that can decrypt
traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing
(bnc#1137865 1146042).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:
- ACPI: custom\_method: fix memory leaks (bsc#1051510).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4254-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

Thanks for filing CVEs for these.

FWIW, link [3] seems to be missing some of the USB bugs since it only includes
bugs seen on the "ci2-upstream-usb" syzbot manager, when in fact USB bugs are
also being reported from the "ci-upstream-kmsan-gce" manager.

Based on my categorization of all open syzbot reports, as of today there are 80
USB-related ones, 52 of which have occurred in the last week.  The 52 are listed
at [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/20190822032841.GC6111@zzz.localdomain/T/#u](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-usb/20190822032841.GC6111%40zzz.localdomain/T/#u)
These include use-after-frees, out of bounds reads/writes, using uninitialized
memory, general protection faults, etc.  More are reported each week, and syzbot
has covered only a tiny percentage of Linux's USB driver code so far.

# CVE-2019-14821

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-14818.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-14822.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-14821 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14821)

#### Description

An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel, all versions through 5.3, in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm\_coalesced\_mmio' object, wherein write indices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be supplied by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system.

An update that solves four vulnerabilities and has 59 fixes
is now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-15291: There was a NULL pointer dereference caused by a
malicious USB device in the flexcop\_usb\_probe function in the
drivers/media/usb/b2c2/flexcop-usb.c driver (bnc#1146540).
- CVE-2019-14821: An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the way Linux
kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation.
It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm\_coalesced\_mmio' object,
wherein write indices 'ring->first' and 'ring->last' value could be
supplied by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or
process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash
the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially
escalating privileges on the system (bnc#1151350).
- CVE-2017-18595: A double free may be caused by the function
allocate\_trace\_buffer in the file kernel/trace/trace.c (bnc#1149555).
- CVE-2019-9506: The Bluetooth BR/EDR specification up to and including
version 5.1 permits sufficiently low encryption key length and did not
prevent an attacker from influencing the key length negotiation. This
allowed practical brute-force attacks (aka "KNOB") that can decrypt
traffic and inject arbitrary ciphertext without the victim noticing
(bnc#1137865 bnc#1146042).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2
* [linux-snapdragon](/security/cves?package=linux-snapdragon) - Linux kernel for Snapdragon processors

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19050](/security/CVE-2019-19050), [CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19077](/security/CVE-2019-19077))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC Router TUN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19079](/security/CVE-2019-19079))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or have other unspecified impacts. ([CVE-2019-19252](/security/CVE-2019-19252))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Sound Open Firmware (SOF) driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18811](/security/CVE-2019-18811))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19050](/security/CVE-2019-19050), [CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Broadcom Netxtreme HCA device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19077](/security/CVE-2019-19077))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

It was discovered that the IO uring implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly perform credentials checks in certain situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to gain administrative privileges.

([CVE-2019-19241](/security/CVE-2019-19241))

Or Cohen discovered that the virtual console subsystem in the Linux kernel

did not properly restrict writes to unimplemented vcsu (unicode) devices. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash) or have other unspecified impacts. ([CVE-2019-19252](/security/CVE-2019-19252))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel on x86

platforms when keeping track of which process was assigned control of the

FPU. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory

corruption) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-19602](/security/CVE-2019-19602))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

It was discovered that the Kvaser CAN/USB driver in the Linux kernel did

not properly initialize memory in certain situations. A local attacker

could possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-19947](/security/CVE-2019-19947))

Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-19965](/security/CVE-2019-19965))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

## Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly clear data

structures on context switches for certain Intel graphics processors. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information.

([CVE-2019-14615](/security/CVE-2019-14615))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically

proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-15099](/security/CVE-2019-15099))

It was discovered that the HSA Linux kernel driver for AMD GPU devices did

not properly check for errors in certain situations, leading to a NULL

pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16229](/security/CVE-2019-16229))

It was discovered that the Marvell 8xxx Libertas WLAN device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly check for errors in certain situations,

leading to a NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could possibly use

this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-16232](/security/CVE-2019-16232))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Virtual Video Test

Driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker with write access to /dev/video0 on

a system with the vivid module loaded could possibly use this to gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-18683](/security/CVE-2019-18683))

It was discovered that the Renesas Digital Radio Interface (DRIF) driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data. A local attacker could

possibly use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-18786](/security/CVE-2019-18786))

It was discovered that the Afatech AF9005 DVB-T USB device driver in the

Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-18809](/security/CVE-2019-18809))

It was discovered that the btrfs file system in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate metadata, leading to a NULL pointer dereference. An

attacker could use this to specially craft a file system image that, when

mounted, could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-18885](/security/CVE-2019-18885))

It was discovered that multiple memory leaks existed in the Marvell WiFi-Ex

Driver for the Linux kernel. A local attacker could possibly use this to

cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19057](/security/CVE-2019-19057))

It was discovered that the crypto subsystem in the Linux kernel did not

properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).

([CVE-2019-19062](/security/CVE-2019-19062))

It was discovered that the Realtek rtlwifi USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19063](/security/CVE-2019-19063))

It was discovered that the RSI 91x WLAN device driver in the Linux kernel

did not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory

exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19071](/security/CVE-2019-19071))

It was discovered that the Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in

the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error

conditions. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of

service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19078](/security/CVE-2019-19078))

It was discovered that the AMD GPU device drivers in the Linux kernel did

not properly deallocate memory in certain error conditions. A local

attacker could use this to possibly cause a denial of service (kernel

memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-19082](/security/CVE-2019-19082))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the AppleTalk networking subsystem of the

Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions, leading to a

NULL pointer dereference. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial

of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19227](/security/CVE-2019-19227))

It was discovered that the KVM hypervisor implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle ioctl requests to get emulated CPUID

features. An attacker with access to /dev/kvm could use this to cause a

denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2019-19332](/security/CVE-2019-19332))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly handle certain conditions. An attacker could use

this to specially craft an ext4 file system that, when mounted, could cause

a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-19767](/security/CVE-2019-19767))

Gao Chuan discovered that the SAS Class driver in the Linux kernel

contained a race condition that could lead to a NULL pointer dereference. A

local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-19965](/security/CVE-2019-19965))

It was discovered that the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP)

implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in

certain error conditions. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a

denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2019-20096](/security/CVE-2019-20096))

Mitchell Frank discovered that the Wi-Fi implementation in the Linux kernel

when used as an access point would send IAPP location updates for stations

before client authentication had completed. A physically proximate attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-5108](/security/CVE-2019-5108))

It was discovered that a race condition can lead to a use-after-free while

destroying GEM contexts in the i915 driver for the Linux kernel. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or

possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-7053](/security/CVE-2020-7053))

It was discovered that the B2C2 FlexCop USB device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate device metadata. A physically proximate

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-15291](/security/CVE-2019-15291))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[slackware-security]  Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2020-008-01)

New kernel packages are available for Slackware 14.2 to fix security issues.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/linux-4.4.208/*:  Upgraded.
   IPV6_MULTIPLE_TABLES n -> y
  +IPV6_SUBTREES y
  These updates fix various bugs and security issues.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.

Installation instructions:
+------------------------+

Upgrade the packages as root:
# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.208-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.208 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.208-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.208 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.
