Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-15296:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   A buffer overflow exists in the `faad_resetbits` function within `libfaad/bits.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, specifically within the `faad_resetbits` function when handling bitstream data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Exploitation could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS).
*   It is also stated that some vulnerabilities in faad2 might allow arbitrary code execution, although this is not specifically stated for CVE-2019-15296.

**Attack vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by processing crafted MPEG AAC data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to supply a maliciously crafted MPEG AAC file to be processed by the vulnerable software.

**Additional details:**
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves a change in the `libfaad/bits.c` file, where a check is introduced to ensure that `ld->buffer_size` is greater or equal to `words * 4` before proceeding, preventing a potential overflow.
*   The fix is also mentioned in relation to a commit in the faad2 repository on GitHub, indicating that the overflow was addressed by ensuring the remaining buffer size (`bytes_left`) is handled correctly.
*   Multiple sources list CVE-2019-15296 along with other faad2 vulnerabilities, suggesting that a batch of fixes were implemented to secure the library.
