Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-15282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an issue in the authentication logic of the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper authentication leading to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated, remote attacker can read tcpdump files generated on the affected device.
- The attacker gains access to sensitive network data potentially contained in the tcpdump files.
- This is classified as an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker sends a crafted request to the web interface.
- The attack vector is over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the web interface of the vulnerable Cisco ISE device.
- No prior authentication is needed.
- No special privileges are required to initiate the attack.
- User interaction is required as indicated by the CVSS vector (UI:R).

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco ISE Software releases earlier than Release 2.4.0 Patch 10.
- There are no workarounds for this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released software updates (2.4.0 Patch 10 and later) to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Krzysztof Przybylski of Przybylski Consulting.
- The CVSS v3 base score is 4.3 (MEDIUM severity) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the specific naming scheme of the tcpdump file.
