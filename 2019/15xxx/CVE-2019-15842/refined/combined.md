## Description

Restaurant Menu Plugin lets you easily manage your restaurant menus online in just minutes. Designed with employee-friendliness in mind, this plugin includes a user role specifically for uploading restaurant menus as PDFs or other file types. It allows you or authorized staff to upload and manage food and drink menus on your site effortlessly. Menu links can be embedded using a shortcode or the raw link.

Documentation: <https://beautiful-wp.com/documentation/>

#### Key Features

1. The upload area is completely separate from the other admin settings, staff can be given permission to upload menus without any risk.
2. Support for Gutenberg Blocks
3. SEO and User friendly: Links are stable -> you can change the menu name, but the link to the menu stays the same.
4. Unlimited menus supported with premium add-on: [beautiful-wp.com](https://beautiful-wp.com/wordpress-plugin/easy-pdf-restaurant-menu-upload-food-menu/). The basic version supports lunch menu and a main menu.
5. Links to menus can be placed everywhere in wordpress: you get shortcodes for the links.
6. Linktext can easily be changed in the shortcode.
7. Multilanguage support.
8. Add a descriptive text for the menu uploader with instructions.
9. Optional redirect to Menu Upload Page, after login.

The menus can be uploaded under Media > Easy Menu Upload.

With this plugin you can leave the restaurant menu upload to your employee. The file type is fixed and if the employee does have the user role **Restaurant Menu Uploader** he can only upload the food menus, nothing else.

## Blocks

This plugin provides 1 block.

* Nsceprm Simplelink

## Installation

Just install this plugin and go to Media > Easy Menu Upload to upload the menu files.

#### Shortcodes

You can refer to the menus everywhere in wordpress with the following shortcodes:

**To get ready to use html link**

**For Lunch:** [nsc\_eprm\_menu\_link restaurant\_menu\_type=”lunch” linktext=”Lunch menu”]

**For general menu:** [nsc\_eprm\_menu\_link restaurant\_menu\_type=”general” linktext=”General Menu”]

You can change the text of “linktext” as you like.

Both will return a html link ready for usage, with the text of the defined “linktext” value.

**to get file url**

[nsc\_eprm\_menu\_file\_url restaurant\_menu\_type=”lunch” cachebuster=true]

If you use the premium add-on and have more link types you get the shortcode for the required food menu in the upload section.

#### New user role

This Plugin also adds a new role: **Restaurant Menu Uploader**. User with this role can only upload the restaurant menu and see the dashboard, so perfect for any employee.
