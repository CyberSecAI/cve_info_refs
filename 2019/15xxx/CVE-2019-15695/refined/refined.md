```
CVE-2019-15695
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Insufficient sanitization of the `PixelFormat` in `CMsgReader::readSetCursor`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stack buffer overflow due to missing validation of pixel format data, allowing attacker-controlled offset when writing values into a buffer on the stack.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
Network connectivity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to connect to a vulnerable TigerVNC server and provide a crafted message with a malicious pixel format. The attacker needs to have single authentication to trigger this vulnerability
