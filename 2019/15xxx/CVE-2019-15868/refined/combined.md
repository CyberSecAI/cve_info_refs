Well, well, well. First, you need to purchase to find out that the complete system is relying on cookies. What a shame, this is not practical, once a user is deleting his browser, referral sales are no longer recorded which is a mess. This makes a NO GO for this plugin at all. Support is also crap, after one message no further interaction.

I have tried for more than 3 years to have them fix a bug. The plugin is not loading jquery and css when language is other than default. Instead lof looking at how to help a paying customer, they say it’s not core WP feature and refuse to look at it.
Pathetic !!Can’t put the link here, but just google this: “uncaught typeerror.datepicker is not a function” “affiliate manager”

I initially read some of the other reviews and got discouraged from downloading and trying this plugin. But luckily I did do it in the end because as it turns out, these other reviewers must have either reviewed a very old (and therefore different) version of this plugin, or they expect everything to be served on a golden plate to them.
I was able to figure out all the functions of this plugin using their website. And now I have successfully set up my own affiliate program. I have achieved something that I thought was very complicated – thanks to this plugin!
