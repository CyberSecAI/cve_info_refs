Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15824 and related vulnerabilities in the "WPS Hide Login" WordPress plugin:

**Note:** The provided information refers to multiple vulnerabilities in WPS Hide Login v1.5.2.2, which were supposedly patched in v1.5.3. CVE-2019-15824 is not explicitly mentioned, but the details align with the type of vulnerabilities described. It's possible CVE-2019-15824 is an umbrella CVE or one that covers one of the specific issues detailed.

**Vulnerabilities in WPS Hide Login v1.5.2.2:**

1.  **Protection Bypass #1**

    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin checks for the string "action=confirmaction" in the URL. If found, it directly includes `wp-login.php`, bypassing the intended protection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts a URL containing "action=confirmaction".
    *   **Impact:** Allows unauthenticated users to access the login page, defeating the purpose of hiding it.
    *   **Example:** `https://example.com/wp-login.php?SECUPRESSaction=confirmaction`

2.  **Protection Bypass #2**

    *   **Root Cause:**  The plugin checks for the presence of the "adminhash" parameter in the URL. If present, it grants access to the login page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attacker crafts a URL including the "adminhash" parameter.
    *   **Impact:**  Allows unauthenticated users to access the login page.
    *   **Example:** `https://exemple.com/wp-admin/?adminhash=1`

3.  **Protection Bypass #3**

    *   **Root Cause:** If WooCommerce is activated, specific `$_GET` parameters (`action=rp`, `key`, and `login`) will redirect to the new login URL.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL with the specified GET parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can be redirected to the custom login page.
    *   **Vulnerable Condition:** Requires WooCommerce to be active.
    *   **Example:** `https://example.com?action=rp&key&login`

4.  **Protection Bypass #4**

    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin checks for "wp-login.php" in the *Referer* header.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        1.  Attacker sends an empty POST request to "`https://example.com/wp-login.php?action=postpass`".
        2.  Attacker modifies the *Referer* header to include "wp-login.php".
    *   **Impact:**  The plugin redirects the attacker to the login page.

5.  **Default Parameter Usage**

    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin uses "login" as the default value for the login URL.
    *   **Weakness:** If the administrator doesn't change the login URL, attackers can guess the location by trying "/login".

6.  **Full Path Disclosure**

    *   **Root Cause:** Triggering the "wps\_hide\_login\_signup\_enable" hook with the correct URL leads to a fatal error because the function `wpmu_activate_signup()` is not declared (missing file inclusion).
    *   **Impact:** The error message reveals the full path to the plugin files.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Requires specific URL with the vulnerable hook triggered.

**General Characteristics:**

*   **Weakness:** Reliance on easily bypassed checks (string matching in URLs, presence of specific GET parameters, checking the referer).
*   **Impact:** Circumvention of the plugin's intended security feature (hiding the login page).
*   **Attack Vector:** Crafted URLs, modified headers.
*   **Required Capabilities:** Basic understanding of HTTP requests and WordPress plugin behavior. No special privileges are required.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerabilities were supposedly patched in version 1.5.3.  Users should update to the latest version of the plugin.
*   Ensure the custom login URL is not the default "login".
*   Applying more robust methods for restricting access to the login page.
