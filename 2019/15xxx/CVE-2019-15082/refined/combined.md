We use this plugin for a little over 1 year now.
The contact, support and help are outstanding, quick replies, good communication and good understanding of the English language.
He is really willing to help where he can to solve the problem or question.
We requested some custom features, and after the invoice, a few days later he could already start working.
Approximately a week later the total custom feature is tested and working!!
Good plugin, but even better support.
We would really recommend to others!

At first I thought it was working but days later I looked at it and see that it is breaking the page code and since it is no longer supported there is nothing I can do but go find something else that works. Bummer.

This product is great and helps with conversions. While there‚Äôs the odd bugs, Matus is super helpful for solving them.
What I love about this plugin (as opposed to other 360 rotate plugins \*cough smart product viewers cough\*) is that it takes advantage of caching the rotation, so it‚Äôs not rebuilding it every time someone hits your page. It‚Äôs honestly night and day as far as load-times go.
So there you have it, faster load times, the rare bug (Just working through with Matus over some https stuff) but support that matches it. Buy the pro version and support the dev ‚Äì it‚Äôs honestly worth it.
