{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Serial Attached SCSI library (libsas) did not correctly handle a failure to discover devices beyond a SAS expander.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Resource leak, kernel BUG due to an attempt to add a phy to an already existing port.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Resource leak and crash (BUG).",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered by a failure during SAS expander discovery.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "No specific attacker capabilities/position are mentioned other than the ability to trigger the SAS discovery failure.  The content notes 'The security impact of this is unclear.'."
