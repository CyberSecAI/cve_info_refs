## Description

This is the official Facebook for WooCommerce plugin that connects your WooCommerce website to Facebook. With this plugin, you can install the Facebook pixel, and upload your online store catalog, enabling you to easily run dynamic ads.

Marketing on Facebook helps your business build lasting relationships with people, find new customers, and increase sales for your online store. With this Facebook ad extension, reaching the people who matter most to your business is simple. This extension will track the results of your advertising across devices. It will also help you:

* Maximize your campaign performance. By setting up the Facebook pixel and building your audience, you will optimize your ads for people likely to buy your products, and reach people with relevant ads on Facebook after they’ve visited your website.
* Find more customers. Connecting your product catalog automatically creates carousel ads that showcase the products you sell and attract more shoppers to your website.
* Generate sales among your website visitors. When you set up the Facebook pixel and connect your product catalog, you can use dynamic ads to reach shoppers when they’re on Facebook with ads for the products they viewed on your website. This will be included in a future release of Facebook for WooCommerce.

I have been running this plugin for well over a year now. I finally became so utterly sick of the updates causing major, major issues to my WooCommerce store that I made the decision to permanently disable the Facebook plugin. By doing so, I have noticed a huge improvement to the speed of my entire site which was quite the revelation and, also, quite concerning as that means one little plugin has been slowing my site down for all this time. I don’t care how much they claim to improve this plugin over time – I will NEVER run it on my site or any other EVER again! How can such a monolith in the tech world get this so wrong?!

Since recently I started noticing how my entire site, especially checkout page is slow. I upgraded my hosting plan to as high as possible, but still I got the same problem. Finally, I found when debugging this single plugin is responsible for the whole site to slow down. I strongly recommend to not install this plugin as it causes your entire site to be slow even if you are on a premium hosting plan.

Made our site significantly slower. And adding things to the cart took ages. Completely useless.
