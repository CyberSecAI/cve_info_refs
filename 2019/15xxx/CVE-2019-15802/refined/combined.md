# CVE-2019-15802 decrypter

The Zyxel firmware for the GS1900 switches, at least version 2.40(AAHH.2)C0,
contains a hardcoded parameters which are used for AES256-CBC encryption an
decryption of passwords. These parameters (IV, salt and password) are fixed
for all devices running the firmware.

```
salt[] = "1A3BB2F78D6EC7D8";
iv[32] = "2268BA68768B58C3687D4F205923A741";
key_data[64] = "EC14D4F5BC6B9A3766D31EF9A1BB854121FB938B606462C70B2D0E26549C486A";
```

A longer write-up of this (and the associated issues) is available [here](https://jasper.la/exploring-zyxel-gs1900-firmware-with-ghidra.html) and Zyxel's advisory is [here](/jasperla/realtek_turnkey_decrypter/blob/master).

## decrypter

Based on the code in `libsal.so` (responsible the encryption and decryption in the
firmware) I hacked up a quick tool to demonstrate how these hardcoded parameters
can be used to decrypt passwords, e.g. in combination with [CVE-2019-15799](https://vimeo.com/354726424).

The hardcoded credentials in the firmware ([CVE-2019-15801](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15799))
were also encrypted with this key.

### or, how I found multiple vulnerabilities on a lazy Sunday afternoon[⌗](#or-how-i-found-multiple-vulnerabilities-on-a-lazy-sunday-afternoon)

Earlier this year the NSA released [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/), a reverse engineering suite with support for a large number of CPU/MCU instruction sets. While I have some experience with [Hopper](https://www.hopperapp.com/) and [radare2](https://rada.re/r/) I wanted to play with Ghidra to poke around the firmware for my Zyxel GS1900-8 switch which runs on a 32-bit MIPS CPU. All in all this has turned out to be an interesting exploration of both Ghidra and the `GS1900-8-2.40(AAHH.2)C0.bix` firmware image.

Initially I wanted to write about poking around the firmware image and showing how one can use Ghidra to explore unknown binaries, but whilst looking around some libraries that are used by this switch I realised there is actually an interesting vulnerability to write about.

## TL;DR[⌗](#tldr)

“Unprivileged” users have full administrative privileges through SSH which also allows for obtaining encrypted credentials, which can then be trivially decrypted.

Secondly, there are two undocumented and password protected interfaces. One is a password recovery menu only reachable via serial console and the other is diagnostic menu which is available via SSH. The passwords for these hidden menus are hardcoded in the firmware.

## Extracting the binaries and libraries[⌗](#extracting-the-binaries-and-libraries)

The firmware image I used was downloaded from the [Zyxel support site](https://www.zyxel.com/support/DownloadLandingSR.shtml?c=gb&l=en&kbid=M-01596&md=GS1900-8) or you can grab it from their FTP site.

Binwalk had a hard time figuring out what was in the `bix` file however it did get a number of binaries extracted that were of enough interest to pursue further exploration of this image. A quick search revealed the [gs1900fw](https://github.com/cmsj/gs1900fw) project which was used to extract the firmware:

```
% python gs1900fw.py -w GS1900-8-2.40\(AAHH.2\)C0.bix -e
Loading: GS1900-8-2.40(AAHH.2)C0.bix
Checking file magic: Expected 0x83800000, found 0x83800000
Examining part: 0
  Writing to: GS1900-8-2.40(AAHH.2)C0.bix-part-0.gz
  Decompressing to: GS1900-8-2.40(AAHH.2)C0.bix-part-0-vmlinux_org.bin
  Writing kernel to: GS1900-8-2.40(AAHH.2)C0.bix-part-0-vmlinux_org.bin-kernel
  Writing initramfs to: GS1900-8-2.40(AAHH.2)C0.bix-part-0-vmlinux_org.bin-initramfs.gz

```

Next I extracted the `initramfs.gz` o Linux with GNU cpio as it required the `--no-absolute-filenames` flag:

```
$ gunzip GS1900-8-2.40\(AAHH.2\)C0.bix-part-0-vmlinux_org.bin-initramfs.gz
$ cpio -vid --no-absolute-filenames < GS1900-8-2.40\(AAHH.2\)C0.bix-part-0-vmlinux_org.bin-initramfs

```

This resulted in a few files which appear to be Busybox related, nothing that would indicate this being a switch firmware yet, except for an `sqfs.img` file:

```
$ binwalk sqfs.img

```

This contained the real binaries used by the device:

## Initial analysis[⌗](#initial-analysis)

*Note: all C-like code was copied from the Decompile view of Ghidra, in general this was a very good representation of the assembly so that made it a lot easier to comb to the code.*

After some initial poking around various binaries and libraries I focussed my attention to `cli` which is the entrypoint application that gets spawned when a user connects via telnet or SSH:

![gs1900-telnet-start_login.png](/images/gs1900-telnet-start_login.png)

Going through `main()` of `cli` you’ll eventually hit a call to `vtysh_readline_init`:

![gs1900-cli-readline_init](/images/gs1900-cli-readline_init.png)

This is where it gets interesting, because aside from the known keybindings such as `0x3f`/`?` for a help-like text, there is this call:

```
rl_bind_keyseq("\\C-\\M-t",vtysh_diagDebug);

```

That’s `CTRL-ALT-t` to trigger `vtysh_diagDebug()` which I wasn’t aware of it existed and judging by the key combination needed to trigger it, it’s not meant for general consumption (cat owners might trigger this combination more often than others though..)

![gs1900-cli-diagdebug.png](/images/gs1900-cli-diagdebug.png)

What this function does is it checks if remote debugging is enabled (remote being not connected to serial, so basically via a network connection) by calling `fds_sys_remoteDebugEnable_ret()` from `libfds.so.0.0`. Disassembling that function I expected it to check a configuration flag or a switch or anything. But no, it simply returned `1` indicating that remote debugging is enabled. Odd.
Also note that `cmd_textline_enable_get()` is simply returns `0`, so this branch is always taken.

Next it prints `Diagnostics:` and waits for input which, judging by the code, is supposed to be a password of sorts. But there is nothing that indicates this, again, odd. Renaming a few variables (with hindsight) we get:

```
printf("\nDiagnostics: ");
memset(user_input, 0, 0x20);
input_str(user_input, 0x1f, 0x2a);
memset(encrypted_input, 0, 0x41);
sal_util_str_encrypt(user_input, encrypted_input);
debug_password = (char *)fds_sys_passDebugPasswd_ret();
rc = strcmp(encrypted_input, debug_password);
if (rc == 0) {
	puts("Press ENTER to continue");
	diagdbg_auth = 1;
	diagdbg_flag = 1;
}

```

So it reads the user input, encrypts it and compares it against what `fds_sys_passDebugPasswd_ret()` returned. This function returns a hardcoded string:

```
char * fds_sys_passDebugPasswd_ret(void)
{
  return "jjvoKbG3ShgF1fdV3CxHWA==";
}

```

Looking around `libfds.so.0.0` I also found this function, more on that later.

```
char * fds_sys_passRecoveryPasswd_ret(void)
{
  return "UAZX5JDMex9wNUNjmOHSRSX8NUrI+Xb1dWsghaV2JEo=";
}

```

This looked like a base64 encoded string of sorts, however I couldn’t make sense of the decoded output.

`sal_util_str_encrypt()` imported from `libsal.so.0.0` provided a valuable clue:

![gs1900-sal-str_encrypt.png](/images/gs1900-sal-str_encrypt.png)

So some encryption and base64 encoding going on and aside from standard C and OpenSSL function calls there is a call to what Ghidra named `FUN_000410b0`:

![gs1900-sal-fun004.png](/images/gs1900-sal-fun004.png)

Bingo! Looking at the [OpenSSL API documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/EVP_BytesToKey.html) for `EVP_BytesToKey()` we can rename the variables to paint a more complete picture:

```
memcpy(salt,"1A3BB2F78D6EC7D8",0x11);
memcpy(iv,"2268BA68768B58C3687D4F205923A741",0x20);
memcpy(key_data,"EC14D4F5BC6B9A3766D31EF9A1BB854121FB938B606462C70B2D0E26549C486A",0x40);
type = EVP_aes_256_cbc();
md = EVP_sha1();
key_size = EVP_BytesToKey(type, md, salt, key_data, 0x40, 5, key, iv);

```

At this point I attempted to write a quick decryption tool for the passwords using the decompiled code from the library. This wasn’t needed however because someone posted the source code for `libsal` to GitHub which was easy enough to find with the *unique* values for the salt, IV and key\_data: [`sal_util_crypt.c`](https://github.com/liujl-git/turnkey/blob/91df263d480fef3b32bfd8874003389636cc13c1/rtk_switch_turnkey_sdk/turnkey/lib/libsal/sal_util_crypt.c#L31). I’m not entirely sure this was supposed to have been posted there but it helped to validate my analysis [after writing the initial version of this post the entire GitHub accounts has been removed].

Given that AES256 is a symmetric cipher we simply need the key to decrypt the passwords previously uncovered. And sure enough that worked:

![gs1900-decrypt-key.png](/images/gs1900-decrypt_key.png)

So the password for the hidden diagnostic menu is: `1900one` and the illusive pass recovery password is `gs1900@zyxel.com.tw`. Given the name of the switch this firmware targets that makes sense.

The decryption tool is available on GitHub: [jasperla/CVE-2019-15802](https://github.com/jasperla/CVE-2019-15802).

### Diagnostic menu[⌗](#diagnostic-menu)

Sure enough, logging into the switch via SSH as `admin`, hitting `CTRL-ALT-t` prompted me for a password and dropped me into a diagnostics shell:

```
sw.pwr#

From here one can get and set various settings, including register values of what I believe to belong to the PHY:

```

I decoded them but couldn’t find anything obviously useful so I moved on. This menu is implemented by the `diag` binary.

### passRecoveryPasswd[⌗](#passrecoverypasswd)

Going back to `passRecoveryPasswd`, in `cli` there are several references to password recovery passwords:

```
004103e4 24 84 2f 58     _addiu     a0=>s__Password_Recovery_Password:_00452f58,a0   = "\nPassword Recovery Password: "

004104a8 24 84 2f 94     _addiu     a0=>s_[P]_Password_recovery_for_specif_00452f9   = "[P] Password recovery for specific user"

```

The first is the string printed at a prompt (we now know the password to be entered there) and the second is a menu option to recover the password for a specific user.

Looking where these are actually used it’s in the signal handling for `SIGQUIT`:

![gs1900-cli-sigquit.png](/images/gs1900-cli-sigquit.png)

However as you can see from the code above, it checks `access_flag` if we’re allowed to enter this menu. It turns out that for SSH connections that’s not the case as demonstrated when I send a SIGQUIT (`CTRL+\\`) via SSH:

```
sw.pwr> Do not allow remote user to launch password recovery

sw.pwr>

```

Getting the serial console working didn’t work out so this menu still remains to be explored.

Suffice to say however I couldn’t find a mention of these hidden menus anywhere in the public documentation, nor are there any references to these passwords. What’s worse is that the encryption parameters are public, reused and static across all devices with this firmware (and perhaps other devices where the vendors didn’t change the settings).

### system() calls[⌗](#system-calls)

Furthermore this firmware contains a large number of calls to the libc `system()` function to perform a host of functions. However input is not always sanitised to prevent code injection through user controlled parameters:

`puParm4` is the fourth argument to `cmd_sys_traceroute_exec()`

```
memset(acStack144,0,0x80);
sprintf(acStack144,"traceroute %s -m %u",*puParm4,uVar1);
system(acStack144);

```

Same here, but for `cmd_sys_arp_clear()` which resorts to a `system()` invocation if the third argument is non-zero:

```
{
  [...]
  __stream = &FStack600;
  memset(__stream,0,0x80);
  sprintf((char *)__stream,"arp -d %s 1> /dev/null 2> /dev/null",*puParm4);
  pcVar4 = system;
}
(*pcVar4)(__stream);

```

And again in `cmd_sys_ping_exec()`:

```
iVar1 = sal_util_ipv6str_vlidate(*puParm4);
__format = "ping6 -c %d %s";
if (iVar1 != 0) {
  __format = "ping -c %d %s";
}
sprintf(acStack144,__format,uVar2,*puParm4);
system(acStack144);

```

I couldn’t find these functions actively in use in this version of the firmware, however they could provide useful primitives for an attacker to gain a code execution on the switch.

## Privileged unprivileged users[⌗](#privileged-unprivileged-users)

Before documenting my findings I wanted to see if I could trigger the diagnostic menu via SSH as a regular user. The web interface allows for creating users with one of two types of privilege: `admin` or `user`. So I created a `user`, logged in and triggered the menu. Yikes.

Ok, moving on, what are the privileges actually:

```
sw.pwr# show privilege
Current CLI Username:  unpriv
Current CLI Privilege: 15
sw.pwr#

```

But that’s the same privilege level an admin user has! And sure enough, I had all the commands available to me as a regular user and adding insult to injury, I could now request a tech support dump which contains the encrypted password for `admin`. This password is encrypted in the same way as we previously discussed so it can be decrypted without any effort.

What’s funny is that the same user has very limited rights in the web interface…so it turns out that *unprivileged* users are indeed *unprivileged* in the web interface, but have full administrative rights in the CLI.

To demonstrate this flaw I’ve made a screen recording which demonstrates:

* Create a new user
* Generate and set a new password for the admin account
* Show the limited rights of the user in the webui
* Show equal privileges via SSH and trigger the diagnostic menu to display some register values
* Finally dump the encrypted hashes and decrypt the admin password which was generated at the beginning of the video.

## Reproducing and reporting[⌗](#reproducing-and-reporting)

I have ensured the privileged-unprivileged user accounts issue is not a weird side effect of running this switch for a few years, by doing a factory reset and reproducing the issue.

Also I’ve looked online if anyone was clever enough to post their `tech-support` or `running-config.cfg` anywhere (spoiler: they did) and whether I was able decrypt their passwords without issues (I was).

## Conclusion[⌗](#conclusion)

Reverse engineering firmware is fun and yet scary. It seems that manufacturers hope noone looks at the internals because what I found was simply hidden in plain sight. At least I got to figure out that my switch had much more functionality than was advertised when I bought it, but I’m not sure how happy I am about this…
