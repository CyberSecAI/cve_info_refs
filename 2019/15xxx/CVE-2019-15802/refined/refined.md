Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability CVE-2019-15802:

*   **Root Cause:** The Zyxel GS1900 series switch firmware uses hardcoded parameters (salt, IV, and key) for AES256-CBC encryption and decryption of passwords. These parameters are the same across all devices running the affected firmware.

*   **Vulnerability:** Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key. The encryption relies on a static, hardcoded key, IV, and salt.

*   **Impact:** An attacker can decrypt sensitive information, including user passwords and other configuration data, if they obtain an encrypted password. The hardcoded credentials in the firmware (related to CVE-2019-15801) were also encrypted with this key, amplifying the impact.

*   **Attack Vector:**

    1.  Obtain encrypted passwords from the device. This can be done through vulnerabilities like CVE-2019-15799 (Incorrect access control, allowing unprivileged users to access admin functionality) or by extracting the firmware.
    2.  Use the hardcoded key, IV, and salt to decrypt the passwords. A decryption tool is available on GitHub.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**

    *   Ability to obtain encrypted configuration data, either by exploiting other vulnerabilities or by extracting the firmware.
    *   Knowledge of the hardcoded encryption parameters or access to a tool that uses them.

*   **Affected Devices:** Zyxel GS1900 switches, at least version 2.40(AAHH.2)C0.
