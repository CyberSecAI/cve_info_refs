### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff cd66549...17ee52c`

## Description

![@bradyjoestar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29145722?u=b25351ea8d19c2d288e2c5d89c3ed5f21f16b47d&v=4&size=48)[bradyjoestar](https://github.com/bradyjoestar)opened [on Aug 8, 2019](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/issues/285#issue-478342906)

I have found the following situation:

```
number of connections is: 19
self closed: false
self closing: true
self tls_session.wants_write: false
reregister
number of connections is: 19
self closed: false
self closing: true
self tls_session.wants_write: false
reregister
number of connections is: 19
self closed: false
self closing: true
self tls_session.wants_write: false
reregister
number of connections is: 19
self closed: false
self closing: true
self tls_session.wants_write: false
reregister
number of connections is: 19
self closed: false
self closing: true
self tls_session.wants_write: false
reregister

```

The client is closed and the sever is trapped in loop of `conn_event` and `ready` function.

<https://github.com/ctz/rustls/blob/056d843c0b96ea5ccf7837da3b2de33a87fc0c28/rustls-mio/examples/tlsserver.rs#L182-L189>

Maybe we should change the above code to

```
if self.closing {
            let _ = self.socket.shutdown(Shutdown::Both);
