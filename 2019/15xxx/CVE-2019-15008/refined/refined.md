Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization of the `reviewedBranch` parameter within the `/plugins/servlet/branchreview` resource.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By injecting malicious JavaScript, attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code within the user's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing user credentials
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Redirecting users to malicious sites
    - Other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `reviewedBranch` parameter of the `/plugins/servlet/branchreview` resource.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Remote attacker: An attacker does not need to have any prior access or authentication to exploit this vulnerability. They can simply send a specially crafted request to the vulnerable resource.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload that will be executed when the vulnerable parameter is rendered.

**Affected Products:**
- Atlassian Crucible (fixed in versions 4.7.3 and 4.8.0)
- Atlassian Fisheye (fixed in versions 4.7.3 and 4.8.0)
