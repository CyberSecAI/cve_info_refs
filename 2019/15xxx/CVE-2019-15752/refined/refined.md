{
  "CVE-2019-15752": {
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability arises from insecure default permissions on the C:\\ProgramData\\ folder and its subfolders on Windows, which are writable by all users. Docker for Windows loads executables from this location without proper access controls.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default file permissions",
      "Loading executables from user-writable location without validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can achieve privilege escalation by replacing a legitimate executable used by Docker (e.g., 'docker-credential-wincred.exe') with a malicious one. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Docker service (typically admin) when Docker attempts to load or execute that replaced executable.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system is required to write to the vulnerable directory C:\\ProgramData\\",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to write files to the C:\\ProgramData\\ folder. This is possible for any local user by default. After placing the malicious executable, the attacker would need to trigger an action by docker to load the replaced file (e.g. using 'docker login')."
