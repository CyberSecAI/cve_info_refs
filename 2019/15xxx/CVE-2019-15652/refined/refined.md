{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The web interface of the SatLink VSAT modem did not properly sanitize input for error messages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary client-side code, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious activities by leveraging the XSS vulnerability. Additionally, the use of insecure protocols like HTTP and Telnet would allow attackers to sniff credentials, insert unintended data, or hijack entire management sessions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting malicious code in the form of a crafted URL that, when processed by the vulnerable web interface, executes within the victim's browser session."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that when visited by a victim using a vulnerable browser executes the injected code. The attacker could be in a man-in-the-middle position, or be a user that has access to an administrative account through a different vulnerability, such as insecure credential storage."
