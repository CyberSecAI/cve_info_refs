The provided content is related to CVE-2019-15775.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way several WordPress plugins, specifically those by the developer NicDark (now "Endreww"), handle AJAX requests. These plugins register a `nopriv_` AJAX action that is responsible for importing various WordPress settings. Due to a lack of proper access controls, unauthenticated users can send these AJAX requests to modify the `siteurl` setting of a website.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Unauthenticated access to AJAX actions:** The plugins' AJAX endpoints that are meant to modify settings could be accessed by anyone, including unauthenticated users.
- **Insecure direct object reference (IDOR):** The vulnerable plugins allowed modification of the `siteurl` setting using an AJAX request.
- **Lack of proper input validation/sanitization:**  There was no proper validation or sanitization on user-supplied data in AJAX requests, which allowed attackers to inject malicious URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Website redirection:** Attackers could change the `siteurl` setting, causing all site scripts to load from an attacker-controlled path. This means all traffic from the targeted website is redirected to the malicious URLs.
- **Malware distribution:** The redirected traffic can lead to a wide array of malicious activities such as malware distribution.
- **Arbitrary script execution:** By injecting a malicious `siteurl`, an attacker could replace all of the site's Javascript with attacker-controlled code.
- **Complete compromise:** In effect, this can give an attacker full control over the client side of the website.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending unauthenticated AJAX requests to the vulnerable plugins' endpoints.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not require any authentication or special privileges.
- The attacker only needs knowledge of the vulnerable plugin and its vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
