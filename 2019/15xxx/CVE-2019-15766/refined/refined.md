CVE-2019-15766:
  - Root cause: The KSWEB Web Interface, a tool developed by the vendor, allows authenticated users to update core settings, including server configurations. The 'configFile' field in the AJAX handler lacks a whitelist of files that can be written to, and the write permissions of the application directory aren't restricted.
  - Weakness: Unrestricted file write vulnerability. The application does not validate or restrict the files that can be written to via the 'configFile' parameter.
  - Impact: Remote code execution. An attacker can write a PHP file to the web directory and execute arbitrary commands. If KSWEB runs as root, full device control is possible.
  - Attack vector: An authenticated user can send a POST request to the AJAX handler with the 'act' parameter set to 'save_config', a 'configFile' parameter specifying the path to write to (e.g., a PHP file in the web directory), and 'config_text' containing the PHP code to be written.
  - Required capabilities: Attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the KSWEB Web Interface.
