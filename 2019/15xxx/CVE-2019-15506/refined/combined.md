# CVE-2019-15506: Kaseya VSA — Critical Information Disclosure / Unauthenticated Access

August 23, 2019[CVE](https://cybir.com/category/cve/)

# Exploit Title: Kaseya VSA – Critical Information Disclosure / Unauthenticated Access

# Date: 8/22/2019

# Exploit Author: Ken Pyle, DFDR Consulting

# consult@dfdrconsulting.com

# Vendor Homepage: https://www.kaseya.com

# CVE : CVE-2019-15506

An critical information disclosure issue has been discovered in Kaseya Virtual System Administrator (VSA) through 9.4.0.37. Newer versions may be affected. Kaseya is aware of the issue and has released a patch for this issue. Users are urged to update to the latest release.

An unauthenticated attacker can send properly formatted requests to the web application and download sensitive files and information.

For example, the /DATAREPORTS directory can be farmed for reports and system metadata. Because this directory contains the results of reports such as NMAP, Patch Status, and Active Directory domain metadata, an attacker can easily collect this critical information and parse it for information.

There are a number of other directories and files affected.

Please credit Ken Pyle, DFDR Consulting in all public references to this issue.
