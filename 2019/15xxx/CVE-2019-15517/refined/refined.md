The provided content is related to CVE-2019-15517.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The management interface of the Nginx Proxy Manager allowed access to the local file system due to insufficient input validation. Specifically, the application failed to prevent directory traversal attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory traversal vulnerability.
- Inadequate input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could access sensitive files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd` or other configuration files, potentially leading to information disclosure or further compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending HTTP requests to the management interface with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `..%2f`, `../`) in the URL path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the management interface. This could be an external attacker if the management interface is exposed to the internet, or an internal attacker if the service is within a private network.
