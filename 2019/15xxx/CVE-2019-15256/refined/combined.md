| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Firepower Threat Defense Software IKEv1 Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-ikev1-dos  First Published: 2019 October 2 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvo11077](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvo11077)     CVE-2019-15256     CWE-399       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.0&vector=CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2019-15256     CWE-399       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-ikev1-dos/csaf/cisco-sa-20191002-asa-ftd-ikev1-dos.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) feature of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper management of system memory. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious IKEv1 traffic to an affected device. The attacker does not need valid credentials to authenticate the VPN session, nor does the attacker's source address need to match a peer statement in the crypto map applied to the ingress interface of the affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory resources, leading to a reload of an affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. This advisory is part of the October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication, which includes 10 Cisco Security Advisories that describe 18 vulnerabilities. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: October 2019 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-72541).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products when running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software on interfaces that have the IKEv1 protocol enabled for LAN-to-LAN or Remote Access IPsec VPN connections:    + Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)   + Firepower 2100 Series Appliances   + Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv) The IKEv1 protocol is disabled in Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software by default.  **Note:** IKE version 2 (IKEv2)-based VPN connections are not affected by this vulnerability.  For information about which Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether the IKEv1 Protocol Is Configured To enable the IKEv1 protocol for LAN-to-LAN or Remote Access IPsec VPN connections, two conditions need to be true:    1. An Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) policy for IKEv1 needs to be configured.   2. IKEv1 needs to be enabled on at least one interface. Administrators can use the **show running-config crypto ikev1** command to determine whether an ISAKMP policy for IKEv1 is configured and whether IKEv1 is enabled on at least one interface. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config crypto ikev1** command on a device that has ISAKMP policy 1 configured for IKEv1 and that has IKEv1 enabled on the **outside** interface:  ```   ciscoasa# show running-config crypto ikev1crypto ikev1 enable outsidecrypto ikev1 policy 1 authentication pre-share encryption aes hash sha group 2 lifetime 86400   ``` Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability. Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:   + 3000 Series Industrial Security Appliances (ISAs)   + ASA 1000V Cloud Firewall   + ASA 5505 Series Adaptive Security Appliances   + ASA 5500-X Series Firewalls   + ASA Services Module for Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Switches and Cisco 7600 Series Routers   + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 ASA Security Module   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Firepower Management Center (FMC)  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.6 |
