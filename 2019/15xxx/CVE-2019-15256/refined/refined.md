Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-15256

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper management of system memory within the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) feature of Cisco ASA and FTD software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Exhaustion:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to exhaust system memory resources by sending malicious IKEv1 traffic.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation leads to a device reload, causing a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Malicious IKEv1 Traffic:** The attack is triggered by sending specially crafted IKEv1 packets to a vulnerable device.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to authenticate the VPN session.
- **No Peer Requirement:** The attacker's source address does not need to match a peer statement in the crypto map of the affected device's ingress interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device with IKEv1 enabled.
- **Ability to send malicious IKEv1 packets:** The attacker needs the ability to craft and send IKEv1 packets, but not necessarily establish a valid VPN session.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Adaptive Security Virtual Appliance (ASAv)
- Cisco Firepower 2100 Series Appliances
- Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Virtual (FTDv)

**Note:** IKEv1 needs to be enabled on the interface, as it is disabled by default. IKEv2 based VPN connections are not affected by this vulnerability.
