The provided content relates to CVE-2019-15234.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The SHAREit v4.0.6.177 Windows application's secured channel fails to validate the full message length from the received packet header.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled memory allocation. The application uses the full message length from the received packet header to allocate memory for the expected data. Lack of validation on this length leads to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Resource exhaustion. By providing a large value in the message length, an attacker can force the application to allocate a large amount of memory, potentially up to 2 GB, leading to a denial of service or system instability.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted packets with a large value for the message length in the header to the SHAREit application over the secured channel.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send packets to the SHAREit application over the secured channel. The provided text doesn't explicitly say if the attacker needs to be on the same network or can be remote.
