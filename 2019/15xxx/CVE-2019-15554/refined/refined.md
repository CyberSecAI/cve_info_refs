{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `grow` function in `smallvec` crate does not correctly handle the case where a spilled `SmallVec` is shrunk to a size within its inline capacity. This leads to corruption of memory allocator data structures.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption due to incorrect handling of capacity changes after spilling",
      "Use of uninitialized memory"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially achieve memory disclosure or remote code execution by controlling the value passed to the `grow` function.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `grow` function on a spilled `SmallVec` with a value less than the current capacity.",
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the value passed to the `grow` function."
