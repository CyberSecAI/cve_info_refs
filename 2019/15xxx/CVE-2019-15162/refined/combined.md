Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-eaa681d33e
2019-10-27 01:08:27.202809
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 1.9.1
Release : 1.fc30
URL : <http://www.tcpdump.org>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.

Add support for BPF and libdlpi in OpenSolaris (and SXCE) Hyphenate "link-layer" everywhere Add /sys/kernel/debug/usb/usbmon to the list of usbmon locations In pcap\_read\_linux\_mmap(), if there are no frames available, call poll() even if we're in non-blocking mode, so we pick up errors, and check for the errors in question. Note that poll() works on BPF devices is Snow Leopard If an ENXIO or ENETDOWN is received, it may mean the device has gone away. Deal with it. For BPF, raise the default capture buffer size to from 32k to 512k Support ps\_ifdrop on Linux Added a bunch of #ifdef directives to make wpcap.dll (WinPcap) compile under cygwin.

Tuesday January 9, 2001. guy@alum.mit.edu. Summary for 0.6 release
 New Linux libpcap implementation, which, in 2.2 and later kernels, uses PF\_PACKET sockets and supports kernel packet filtering (if compiled into the kernel), and supports the "any" device for capturing on all interfaces. Cleans up promiscuous mode better on pre-2.2 kernels, and has various other fixes (handles 2.4 ARPHRD\_IEEE802\_TR, handles ISDN devices better, doesn't show duplicate packets on loopback interface, etc.).
 Fixed HP-UX libpcap implementation to correctly get the PPA for an interface, to allow interfaces to be opened by interface name.
 libpcap savefiles have system-independent link-layer type values in the header, rather than sometimes platform-dependent DLT\_ values, to make it easier to exchange capture files between different OSes.
 Non-standard capture files produced by some Linux tcpdumps, e.g. the one from Red Hat Linux 6.2 and later, can now be read.
 Updated autoconf stock files.
 Filter expressions can filter on VLAN IDs and various OSI protocols, and work on Token Ring (with non-source-routed packets).
 "pcap\_open\_dead()" added to allow compiling filter expressions to pcap code without opening a capture device or capture file.
 Header files fixed to allow use in C++ programs.
 Removed dependancy on native headers for packet layout. Removed Linux specific headers that were shipped.
 Security fixes: Strcpy replaced with strlcpy, sprintf replaced with snprintf.
 Fixed bug that could cause subsequent "pcap\_compile()"s to fail erroneously after one compile failed.
 Assorted other bug fixes.
 README.aix and README.linux files added to describe platform-specific issues.
 "getifaddrs()" rather than SIOCGIFCONF used, if available.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

On UN\*X, don't tell the client why authentication failed.

```
"no such user" tells the client that the user ID isn't valid and,
therefore, that it needn't bother trying to do password cracking for
that user ID; just saying that the authentication failed dosn't give
them that hint.

This resolves the third problem in Include Security issue F11: [libpcap]
Remote Packet Capture Daemon Multiple Authentication Improvements.

The Windows LogonUser() API returns ERROR_LOGON_FAILURE for both cases,
so the Windows code doesn't have this issue.  Just return the same
"Authentication failed" message on Windows to the user.

For various authentication failures *other* than "no such user" and
"password not valid", log a message, as there's a problem that may need
debugging.  We don't need to tell the end user what the problem is, as
they may not bother reporting it and, even if they do, they may not give
the full error message.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-10 23:54:47 UTC  ``` rpcapd/daemon.c in libpcap before 1.9.1 mishandles certain length values because of reuse of a variable. This may open up an attack vector involving extra data at the end of a request.  Upstream patch:  <https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/commit/617b12c0339db4891d117b661982126c495439ea>  References:  <https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/libpcap-1.9/CHANGES>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-10-10 23:58:19 UTC  ``` Created libpcap tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1760624](show_bug.cgi?id=1760624 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2018-16301 CVE-2019-15161 CVE-2019-15162 CVE-2019-15163 CVE-2019-15164 CVE-2019-15165 libpcap: various flaws [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c2)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-16 16:35:44 UTC  ``` RPCAPD support added in tcpdump 1.9.0 (see <https://github.com/the-tcpdump-group/libpcap/blob/libpcap-1.9/CHANGES#L74>). RHEL 6 and 7 ship an older version of libpcap that does not even have the vulnerable file. RHEL 8 ships a newer version, however it is not compiled with RPCAPD support (--enable-remote is not specified).   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c3)  Riccardo Schirone    2020-01-16 16:35:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of libpcap as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 as they did not include support for RPCAPD.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1760623#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-01-16 20:09:41 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed. Further updates for individual products will be reflected on the CVE page(s):  <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2019-15161>   ``` |  |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-4fe461079f
2019-10-27 01:29:09.690085
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 1.9.1
Release : 1.fc31
URL : <http://www.tcpdump.org>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.Â  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.Â  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.Â  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2633852.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2633852.1).

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-b92ce3144a
2019-10-27 02:05:07.760949
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : libpcap
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 1.9.1
Release : 1.fc29
URL : <http://www.tcpdump.org>
Summary : A system-independent interface for user-level packet capture
Description :
Libpcap provides a portable framework for low-level network
monitoring. Libpcap can provide network statistics collection,
security monitoring and network debugging. Since almost every system
vendor provides a different interface for packet capture, the libpcap
authors created this system-independent API to ease in porting and to
alleviate the need for several system-dependent packet capture modules
in each application.

Install libpcap if you need to do low-level network traffic monitoring
on your network.
