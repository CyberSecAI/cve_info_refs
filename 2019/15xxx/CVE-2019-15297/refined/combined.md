Asterisk
Project Security Advisory - AST-2019-004

| **Product** | Asterisk |
| **Summary** | Crash when negotiating for T.38 with a declined stream |
| **Nature of Advisory** | Remote Crash |
| **Susceptibility** | Remote Authenticated Sessions |
| **Severity** | Minor |
| **Exploits Known** | No |
| **Reported On** | August 05, 2019 |
| **Reported By** | Alexei Gradinari |
| **Posted On** | September 05, 2019 |
| **Last Updated On** | September 4, 2019 |
| **Advisory Contact** | kharwell AT sangoma DOT com |
| **CVE Name** | CVE-2019-15297 |

| **Description** | When Asterisk sends a re-invite initiating T.38 faxing, and the endpoint responds with a declined media stream a crash will then occur in Asterisk. |
| **Modules Affected** | res\_pjsip\_t38.c |

| **Resolution** | If T.38 faxing is not required then setting the ât38\_udptlâ configuration option on the endpoint to ânoâ disables this functionality. This option defaults to ânoâ so you have to have explicitly set it âyesâ to potentially be affected by this issue.    Otherwise, if T.38 faxing is required then Asterisk should be upgraded to a fixed version. |

| **Affected Versions** | | |
| **Product** | **Release Series** |  |
| Asterisk Open Source | 15.x | All releases |
| Asterisk Open Source | 16.x | All releases |

| **Corrected In** | |
| **Product** | **Release** |
| Asterisk Open Source | 15.7.4,16.5.1 |

         Product        Asterisk
         Summary        Crash when negotiating T.38 with a zero port
    Nature of Advisory  Remote Crash
      Susceptibility    Remote Authenticated Sessions
         Severity       Minor
      Exploits Known    No
       Reported On      February 20, 2021
       Reported By      Gregory Massel
        Posted On
     Last Updated On    February 25, 2021
     Advisory Contact   bford AT sangoma DOT com
         CVE Name       CVE-2019-15297

      Description     When Asterisk sends a re-invite initiating T.38 faxing
                      and the endpoint responds with a m=image line and zero
                      port, a crash will occur in Asterisk. This is a
                      reoccurrence of AST-2019-004.
    Modules Affected  res_pjsip_t38.c

    Resolution  If T.38 faxing is not required then setting ât38_udptlâ on
                the endpoint to ânoâ disables this functionality. This
                option is ânoâ by default.

                If T.38 faxing is required, then Asterisk should be upgraded
                to a fixed version.
