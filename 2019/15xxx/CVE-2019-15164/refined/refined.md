  "CVE-2019-15164": {
    "description": "The libpcap library before 1.9.1 is vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. By providing a URL as a capture source to the rpcapd service, an attacker can trick the service into opening a remote device on another server.",
    "affected_component": "libpcap",
    "root_cause": "The rpcapd service in libpcap does not properly validate the capture source string, allowing a URL to be provided, which leads to a server-side request forgery.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause the rpcapd service to open a remote device on a server the attacker chooses, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a crafted request to the rpcapd service with a URL as a capture source."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable rpcapd service. No special privileges are required"
