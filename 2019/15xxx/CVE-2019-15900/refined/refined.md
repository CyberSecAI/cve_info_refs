**Commit:** `2f83222829448e5bc4c9391d607ec265a1e06531`

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The commit addresses potential issues in how user and group IDs were parsed, specifically on Linux systems, and a missing step to drop user groups when running as another user on Linux. The original code on Linux used `sscanf` to parse the user and group ID strings to integers. There was no check to make sure `sscanf` successfully parsed the input and there was no error handling if the input string was not a number.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Lack of Input Validation:** Prior to the fix, the `parseuid` and `parsegid` functions on Linux used `sscanf` without checking the return value. If the input was not a valid numerical ID, `sscanf` would not write to the `uid` or `gid` variables, and their values would remain uninitialized. This could lead to undefined behavior or unexpected privilege escalation.
2.  **Missing Group Dropping**: When the doas utility was used to run a command as a different user on Linux, the original user's groups were not dropped. This meant the new user could still have access to resources and permissions associated with the original user's groups which might lead to privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** If the input to `doas` specifies a user or group ID that is not a number, the uninitialized uid or gid values could be used in subsequent operations, possibly allowing an attacker to escalate privileges or gain access to resources they should not have.
*   **Unexpected Behavior**: Uninitialized uid/gid values can lead to crashes or unpredictable behavior.
*   **Unintended Access:** By not dropping the original user's groups, the target user may unintentionally have access to resources and permissions that are not intended.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Configuration:** An attacker could craft a `doas.conf` or command-line argument that provides invalid user or group IDs which are not numerical.
*   **Compromised user:** A compromised user could use the doas utility and bypass protections by having the program run with the compromised user's group memberships.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to Execute `doas`:** The attacker must be able to execute the `doas` utility.
*   **Control over input parameters:**  The attacker needs some ability to influence the user/group IDs passed to `doas`.

**Additional Notes**
The fix in the commit adds a check on the return status of the sscanf, ensuring the parsing is successful, and adds code to drop the original user's groups on Linux.
