1. [fix the setusercontext(3) workaround](/slicer69/doas/commit/6cf0236184ff6304bf5e267ccf7ef02874069697)
    …

   ```
   Seeing this being used on even more system like Illumos with this ugly
   and security critical bug open makes me cringe every time I check if it
   was finally fixed.

   I reported it directly to the maintainer in 2017. I reported it to
   pkgsrc-security@netbsd.org without a response.
