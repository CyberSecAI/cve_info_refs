Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of specific elements within Webex recordings stored in either Advanced Recording Format (ARF) or Webex Recording Format (WRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of data within ARF and WRF files. This allows for the potential injection of malicious content.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The inadequate validation could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with the privileges of the user who opened the malicious file.
*   **Full System Compromise (Potentially):** Depending on the user's permissions, this could lead to significant system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File Delivery:** Attackers can send a malicious ARF or WRF file to a target user.
*   **Delivery Methods:**  The files can be delivered through various methods:
    *   Links
    *   Email attachments

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Malicious File Creation:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify ARF or WRF files with malicious content.
*   **Social Engineering:**  The attacker must persuade the user to open the malicious file using the vulnerable software.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Network Recording Player and Cisco Webex Player for Microsoft Windows.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Cisco Webex Player for macOS.
*   The advisory lists other related CVEs (CVE-2019-15283, CVE-2019-15284, CVE-2019-15285, and CVE-2019-15286) that have similar root causes and impacts.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities.
*   There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.8, with a vector string of "CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H". This means it is a high severity issue that requires local access, has low attack complexity and user interaction is required to exploit, and the scope is unchanged. The impact is high across confidentiality, integrity and availability.

In summary, this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by sending a specially crafted malicious file and persuading the user to open the file in the vulnerable software.
