## Description

![@thomcc](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/860665?u=bbccd4c10586ffff9f30404e7b8e3071348bfd34&v=4&size=48)[thomcc](https://github.com/thomcc)opened [on Jun 9, 2019](https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/106#issue-453874174)

I've noticed potentially exploitable security vulnerabilities in the following crates[0], which can be triggered by users of these libraries without writing unsafe code.

I'm filing an issue rather than a PR since I don't know that I have time to see this through to it's conclusion, especially since multiple crates and several functions are involved. The FAQ [indicates that this is okay](https://github.com/RustSec/advisory-db/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#faq).

### `pancurses`

The crate <https://crates.io/crates/pancurses> exposes the functions `Window::printw` and `Window::mvprintw` as safe functions (I think this is all of them, but could be wrong), despite these passing an arbitrary rust `str` to into C code which expects to receive a printf-style format string. This can lead to a [format string vulnerability](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Format_string_attack).

I filed [ihalila/pancurses#66](https://github.com/ihalila/pancurses/issues/66) about this, shortly before filing this issue.

### `ncurses`

The crate <https://crates.io/crates/ncurses> exposes the functions `printw`, `mvprintw`, and `mvwprintw` as safe functions, which have the same issues described above.

In [jeaye/ncurses-rs#172](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/issues/172) I raised this issue about `printw` (but missed that it wasn't just `printw`), which lead to that functions deprecation[1]. When writing this issue for the advisory-db, I noticed the existence of the other two functions. I don't see any other functions accepting format strings (the `scanw` functions, mercifully, are not exposed).

Additionally, while filing this bug, I noticed the following additional vulnerabilities or memory safety issues (I haven't filed issues in the `ncurses` crate's repository about these):

* [`instr`](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/2a5dc99ef40c8f836b60b8a5ae9814410fc3bbcb/src/lib.rs#L596) is exposed, which has a buffer overflow (the curses `instr` function is somewhat similar to the `gets` function from the C stdlib, in that writes as much text that it wants into a lengthless buffer pointer).

  + EDIT: I've noticed that `mvwinstr` has the same problem, just not as directly.
* Several functions ([1](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/2a5dc99ef40c8f836b60b8a5ae9814410fc3bbcb/src/lib.rs#L901), [2](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/2a5dc99ef40c8f836b60b8a5ae9814410fc3bbcb/src/lib.rs#L407), [3](https://github.com/jeaye/ncurses-rs/blob/2a5dc99ef40c8f836b60b8a5ae9814410fc3bbcb/src/lib.rs#L547-L550)) write data from the terminal directly into a String's underlying buffer, when the data may not be valid UTF-8. I don't know if this can be exploited, but it's a memory safety issue nonetheless. Hopefully the members of this repository have some intuition as to the exploitability of this sort of problem.
* I have not done a very thorough look, these are just the most obvious problems to me. Ideally, someone more familiar with the curses library's API would look further.

---

[0]: For total clarity, I didn't look at any others. It seems plausible to me that other Rust curses libs have similar mistakes, since it's a very hard API to use safely. That said, I think these are the most popular ones (not that that makes things any better).

[1]: I don't really feel that deprecation is sufficient, as the function is still present (and not `unsafe`). Transitive dependency deprecations aren't reported, so rust code consuming this crate transitively could still be at risk. However, if the members of this repository disagree, then one fewer of the `ncurses` crates functions are problematic in the current release.
