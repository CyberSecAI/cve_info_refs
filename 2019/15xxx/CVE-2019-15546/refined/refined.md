Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15546:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `pancurses` crate in Rust exposes the functions `printw` and `mvprintw` as safe functions. These functions pass a Rust `&str` (string slice) directly to C code. The C code interprets this string as a format string for functions like `printf`. This allows for format string vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary vulnerability is a format string vulnerability in the `printw` and `mvprintw` functions.  Uncontrolled user input in the format string can lead to arbitrary reads and writes in memory.
*   **Unsafe FFI Usage:** The vulnerability stems from incorrect use of Foreign Function Interface (FFI) by passing a Rust string directly to C code which then interprets it as a format string without any sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Memory Access:**  An attacker can use format string specifiers to read from and write to arbitrary locations in memory including stack memory.
*   **Potential for Code Execution:** By carefully crafting the format string, an attacker may be able to overwrite return addresses to gain control of the program execution.
*   **Integrity Violation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to modify data which is a violation of system integrity.
*   **Confidentiality Violation:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially read sensitive data from memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is considered "Network," meaning an attacker can exploit this remotely.
*   **User Input:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a maliciously crafted string as input to the vulnerable functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any special user privileges.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The exploitation of this vulnerability does not require any user interaction.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send crafted strings as input to the vulnerable application over the network.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of `pancurses` up to and including 0.16.1.
*   The vulnerability has not been patched in any version.
*   The vulnerability is classified as High Severity with a CVSS v3 score of 7.5.
*   The attack complexity is low.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by thomcc.

**CVE Details:**
* The CVE-2019-15546 ID is associated with the format string vulnerability in `pancurses`.
* The GitHub Advisory ID is GHSA-m57c-4vvx-gjgq.

**CWE:**
* The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this vulnerability is CWE-134, which is related to uncontrolled format strings.

**Summary:**
The `pancurses` crate in Rust was vulnerable to format string attacks due to unsafe usage of FFI, specifically by passing user-controlled strings to C functions like `printf` without sanitization. An attacker could exploit this to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations. The attacker requires no special privileges or user interaction and can trigger the vulnerability by providing a specially crafted string.
