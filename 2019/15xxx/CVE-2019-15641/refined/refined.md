  "CVE-2019-15641": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Webmin is vulnerable to an authenticated XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability due to improper handling of XML messages in the xmlrpc.cgi endpoint. The XML parser doesn't prevent the use of entities, allowing a logged-in attacker to retrieve local files or discover internal networks with root privileges.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the Perl XML::Parser module in the xmlrpc.cgi endpoint without disabling the use of entities. This allows the processing of external entities within the XML document.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "XML External Entity (XXE) injection"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack allows a logged-in attacker to retrieve local files or discover internal networks with root privileges.",
      "attack_vector": "By sending a crafted XML payload to the xmlrpc.cgi endpoint, an authenticated user can exploit the XXE vulnerability.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a valid user (root, admin or sysadm) with access to the Webmin interface, and be able to send HTTP POST requests with a valid authentication"
