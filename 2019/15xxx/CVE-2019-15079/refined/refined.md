The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2019-15079.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a typo in the constructor of the "EAI" ERC20 token smart contract. Instead of using the `constructor` keyword or naming the function the same as the contract, the function was named `EAI_TokenERC20`. This caused the constructor to be treated as a regular public function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Publicly accessible constructor: Due to the typo, the constructor becomes a regular public function that can be called by anyone.
- Unrestricted token minting: The `EAI_TokenERC20` function allows anyone to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens by controlling the `initialSupply` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can mint unlimited amounts of EAI tokens for free, potentially devaluing the token and disrupting the token's economy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Direct function call: Attackers can directly call the `EAI_TokenERC20` function from outside the contract.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Ethereum smart contract, typically through an Ethereum wallet. No special privileges or positions are needed.
