- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `entropic` CLI tool uses user-supplied input (`argv[0]`) directly in a `require()` call to load command modules. This allows for path traversal via `../` sequences in the command argument, leading to loading of arbitrary JavaScript files from outside the intended command directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Path traversal vulnerability due to insecure use of user input in require statement.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code by providing a path with `../` to a file outside the `commands` directory. This can lead to various security issues including remote code execution, depending on what an attacker has access to.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the command line interface (CLI) of `entropic`. By passing a crafted path argument, an attacker can force the `entropic` tool to load and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to execute the `entropic` CLI tool with a malicious command-line argument. This could be achieved through direct access to the system or by social engineering someone into running the malicious command. The attacker also needs to have the ability to place malicious JavaScript files on the system at the given path.
