- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Content", "Edit urgent message", and "Users" sections of the Admin Console. Specifically, the `Title` field of the Content menu is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability could lead to cookie stealing and other malicious actions. It can also impact unauthenticated users.
- **Attack vectors**:  An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the affected fields, for example, in the `Title` field via the Content menu. This input is then reflected back to the user, executing the script. The request is sent via a POST request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable application. Authentication is not strictly required as the vulnerability can impact unauthenticated visitors. An attacker would need to be able to inject the malicious script into the input fields.
