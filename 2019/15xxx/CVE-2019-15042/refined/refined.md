**Root cause of vulnerability:** The TeamCity VMWare plugin did not check the SSL certificate.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of SSL certificate validation in the VMWare plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:** This could allow a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data exposure.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, where an attacker intercepts communication between TeamCity and the VMWare server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the TeamCity server and the VMWare server, and be capable of intercepting and manipulating network traffic (MITM).
