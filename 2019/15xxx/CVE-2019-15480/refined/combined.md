# XSS Vulnerability in ScenesController.js #3367

## Description

![@Frige1](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/21190223?v=4&size=48)[Frige1](https://github.com/Frige1)opened [on Jul 1, 2019](https://github.com/domoticz/domoticz/issues/3367#issue-462576636)
## Description

The ScenesController.js is vulnerable against XSS. By adding a scene with some scripts in the scene name will lead to a XSS.

Obviously this is thankful for an attacker if he is privilege to adding or edit scenes. The attacker can execute arbitrary code.

## Affected Version

Current release 4.10717

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone and compile it. I follow the instructions from the wiki: <https://www.domoticz.com/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_-_Build_Domoticz_from_source#Raspberry_Pi_-_Build_Domoticz_from_source>
2. Run domoticz `./domoticz`
3. Open `http://localhost:8080/#/Scenes` in your browser.
4. Click button: Add Scene
5. Have fun to implement arbitrary scripts or even test it with `<script>alert("XSS");</script>`

   [![XSS-Vul](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21190223/60420534-468eea80-9be8-11e9-8c85-d6b68570aac9.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21190223/60420534-468eea80-9be8-11e9-8c85-d6b68570aac9.png)

## Fix

Some `escape()` is used in the ScenesController.js, but this XSS is still present. Escaping the `item.name` fix the XSS. Furthermore use `encodeURI()` instead of `escape()`. The `escape()` function was deprecated in JavaScript v1.5.

[![XSS-Fix](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21190223/60420799-daf94d00-9be8-11e9-92be-d7777b109e64.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21190223/60420799-daf94d00-9be8-11e9-92be-d7777b109e64.png)

| Thanks for the PR. Your current PR causes all scene names that includes for example spaces to be displayed with %20 in the name Also names containing non-latin characters to display wrongly.  It also seems not possible to change a name to a non-latin name  Is there another solution ? |
