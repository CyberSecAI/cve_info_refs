{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Confluence Previews plugin in Confluence Server and Data Center communicated with the Atlassian Companion application using the `atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com` domain, which resolves to 127.0.0.1. A signed certificate for this domain was distributed with the Companion application. An attacker controlling DNS resolution could perform a MITM attack.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) vulnerability due to insecure communication between Confluence and the Atlassian Companion application.",
      "Usage of a publicly distributed certificate intended for localhost connections.",
        "Reliance on DNS resolution of atlassian-domain-for-localhost-connections-only.com to resolve to 127.0.0.1"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can observe and/or modify files being edited using the Companion application and access limited user information.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to control the DNS resolution of the victim's machine.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in a position to control DNS resolution for the victim. The attacker also needs to be able to deny the victim access to certificate revocation information."
