[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-address-book/)

## Description

**Notice** ‚Äì This plugin is does not currently work with the WooCommerce Block Checkout. It currently only supports the Classic WooCommerce checkout. We hope to find a way to integrate with the Block Checkout in the future.

Gives your customers the option to store multiple billing and shipping addresses and retrieve them on checkout. Addresses can be updated and modified quickly and easily in /my-account/, or saved as part of the checkout process.

There is a [demo setup](https://woo-address-book.crosspeak.dev) if you would like to try this plugin out with a demo store.

#### Settings

The settings for this plugin are located in WooCommerce General settings: WooCommerce -> Settings -> General.

WooCommerce Address Book options:

* Enable billing/shipping address book
* Add New Address as default selection
* Enable setting Billing/Shipping Address Nickname during Checkout

#### Code

View the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/crosspeaksoftware/woo-address-book). You can also submit an [issue](https://github.com/crosspeaksoftware/woo-address-book/issues) or pull request for anything new.

## Installation

1. Upload the `woo-address-book` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Make sure you have WooCommerce installed and enabled.
3. Activate the WooCommerce Address Book through the ‚ÄòPlugins‚Äô menu in WordPress.
4. Address Book options will now appear on the customer‚Äôs account page and checkout once they‚Äôve entered their primary billing or shipping address.

## FAQ

### Why can‚Äôt I add a new address to my address book?

The address book will only begin to display after the primary billing or shipping address has been created for the customer.

### Will this plugin allow my customers to ship to multiple locations with a single order?

No, this plugin only allows for the storage of multiple shipping addresses. If a customer would like to ship to multiple locations, they should complete multiple orders.

### Why is the address not populating my custom fields at checkout?

Most standard custom fields do work with the Address Book. However, if you have custom fields added by a plugin which are updated by javascript then the Address Book plugin will not always know how to handle the data. If you are running into an issue please post an issue in the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woo-address-book/) or on [github](https://github.com/crosspeaksoftware/woo-address-book/issues) with what plugin or code you are using and as much details as you can. We will determine if the Address Book plugin is able to provide support for the plugin or if a custom solution would need to be developed for your use case.

### How can I add custom fields to my billing/shipping address?

WooCommerce Address Book uses the standard WooCommerce address functions so any method to modify the address fields will still work.

We have tested that using the standard filters works correctly:

\* <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/tutorial-customising-checkout-fields-using-actions-and-filters/>

We have also tested this plugin by WooCommerce:

\* <https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-checkout-field-editor/>

### How do I translate this plugin?

We now use the new way of translating WordPress plugins at <https://translate.wordpress.org/>

Feel free to contribute a translation at <https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-address-book/>

### How do I get my translation approved?

Someone needs to apply to be a translation editor for this plugin. If you have contributed a translation, you may apply to be the editor yourself.

You can make the request and that request can be approved by the WordPress Localization editors.

See here for more details: <https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/rosetta/roles-and-capabilities/pte-request/#pte-request-by-a-translator>

### How can I use my translation before it is approved?

What you can do to use it locally right now is go to the translate page.

At the bottom by the Export link, select ‚ÄúOnly matching the filter‚Äù and ‚ÄúMachine Object Message Catalog (.mo)‚Äù and then click Export to download the `.mo` file.

Then save this .mo file to your WordPress site at `wp-content/languages/plugins/woo-address-book-LANGUAGE.mo` replacing `LANGUAGE` with your language code.

For example for German, you would go here:

<https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/woo-address-book/stable/de/default/>

Then save this .mo file to your WordPress site at `wp-content/languages/plugins/woo-address-book-de_DE.mo`

You may also use PoEdit and create a translation file which can be exported as a `.mo` file to be saved in the same location.

### [Great (and Simple) Plugin With No Bloat](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/great-and-simple-plugin-with-no-bloat/)

[mgrandbois1](https://profiles.wordpress.org/mgrandbois1/ "Posts by mgrandbois1")

I have been using this plugin for my highly custom site, and so far, it stands as the best address book plugin for WooCommerce. It is incredibly simple, well-coded (with no noticeable bloat), easy to install and configure, and easy to customize from both a developer and user standpoint.
Plugins like this one save me (and everyone else) dozens of hours of development time, so I truly appreciate when people can put out a clean plugin that delivers exactly what it advertises. Great work team üôå

### [Practical and Functional](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/practical-and-functional-2/)

The plugin allows to create the address book of customers as described. At this point, it is quite practical and functional. There are currently no functional defects. So it does what it promises. Also, according to Woocommerce updates, the plugin works in harmony and updates are made when necessary.
For now, my advice is to improve the my account>addresses section in terms of design. Hopefully, there will be a study for this in the next updates. It could be a more eye-catching design. Thank you.

This is exactly what I need. Although I think the search address is not needed but it‚Äôs actually a quite nice feature to have at your disposal.
Nice work. Highly recommend this plugin.
