Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15055:

*   **Vulnerability:** Directory traversal in the disk naming functionality of MikroTik RouterOS leading to arbitrary file deletion and code execution.
*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input validation on the "name" parameter in the "disk" menu, allowing an authenticated user to manipulate the disk name to include directory traversal characters (`.` and `/`).
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  The attacker must have valid credentials to access the RouterOS web interface or API.
    2.  The attacker mounts a USB drive.
    3.  The attacker renames the mounted disk to include directory traversal characters (e.g., `../../../ram/pckg/snmp_xploit`).
    4.  If the attacker wants code execution, they must create a specific directory structure (e.g., `/nova/lib/snmp/`) on the USB drive and place a shared object (`.so`) file within it. When SNMP is enabled/restarted, it will load the shared object, resulting in code execution. Alternatively, the attacker could overwrite `/rw/store/user.dat` to reset the admin password.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Deletion:**  An authenticated attacker could delete arbitrary files on the system. For example, deleting `/rw/store/user.dat` resets the administrator password to blank after a reboot.
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** By leveraging the symlink creation, the attacker can trick RouterOS into loading a malicious shared object from a USB drive, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires valid RouterOS user credentials.  The exploit can be performed remotely once authenticated. Physical access is needed to insert the USB drive.
*   **Affected Versions:** Confirmed to be fixed in 6.46rc34 and 6.45.5. The vulnerability was present in earlier versions, and at the time of the analysis, remained unfixed in the "Long-term" release branch.
*   **Technical Details**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by the `diskd` binary when it creates symlinks based on the disk name.
    *   The `dlopen()` function is used by the SNMP process to load shared objects from directories within `/pckg/`, which can be exploited to load a malicious shared object from the USB drive.
    *   The provided exploit code mounts the `/boot/` directory to `/pckg/option`, enabling the developer backdoor and allowing root access via telnet/ssh.

This vulnerability allows a malicious actor to gain full control over the RouterOS device.
