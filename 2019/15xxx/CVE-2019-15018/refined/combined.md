### Description

A security vulnerability exists in the Zingbox Inspector where authentication is not required when binding the Inspector instance to a different customer tenant. (Ref: CVE-2019-15018)

Customers still running affected versions of Zingbox Inspector software can mitigation this issue by updating to a patched version, or by disabling the console access that can be used to run CLI commands.
