Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-15126:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a logic error in the implementation of wireless egress packet processing of certain Broadcom Wi-Fi chipsets and Cypress Wi-Fi chips.
*   Specifically, after an affected device handles a disassociation event, it could send a limited number of Wi-Fi frames encrypted with a static, weak Pairwise Temporal Key (PTK).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Use of a static and weak PTK:** Instead of using a newly negotiated PTK after a disassociation, the device uses a static, easily decryptable PTK for a short period.
*   **Improper Layer 2 Wi-Fi Encryption:** Internal errors, caused by crafted traffic and state transitions, leads to improper encryption.
*   **Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition:**  A race condition in the state transitions of the Wi-Fi chip allows for the vulnerability to occur.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can decrypt a limited number of Wi-Fi frames transmitted immediately after a disassociation event using the static PTK.
*   **Exposure of network traffic:** This could expose sensitive information transmitted in those frames, even though it is a small amount of traffic.
    * Note that end-to-end (SSL/TLS) encryption is not compromised, so application-layer data is usually still protected.
    * The attack degrades security a step towards an open Wi-Fi network, making it easier to view unencrypted data.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Access:** The attacker needs to be within Wi-Fi range of the affected device.
*   **Disassociation Trigger:** Attackers can trigger a disassociation event, either by injecting malicious packets or passively waiting for a legitimate disassociation.
*   **Frame Capture:** The attacker needs to capture the Wi-Fi frames sent immediately after the disassociation event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Unauthenticated adjacent attacker:** The attacker does not need prior authentication or access to the Wi-Fi network.
*   **Packet capture capability:** The attacker needs to be able to capture Wi-Fi packets/frames.
*  **Knowledge to trigger disassociation:** Either by active injection or passively listening for disconnect events.

**Additional details from the provided documents:**

*   **Device Impact:** Multiple Cisco wireless products, Apple devices, and other vendors (e.g., Aruba, Asus, D-Link, Huawei, Mist, Samsung, Thomas Krenn, Zebra) using affected Broadcom and Cypress chips are impacted.
*  **Mitigations**:  Most vendors have released patches. Disabling Wi-Fi when possible is also a workaround.
*   **No Key Compromise:**  The original Wi-Fi security key isn't compromised and the attacker can't inject data frames or cause buffer overflows.
*   **Limited Scope:** The vulnerability is limited to information exposure in a few data frames that are transmitted before proper encryption is re-established.

**CVSS:**

*   The CVSS v3.0/3.1 Base Score is consistently reported as **3.1** or **4.3 (using AV:A/AC:L)** with the vector string `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N` or `CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   Temporal scores are also available in some reports.

**In summary, CVE-2019-15126 (Kr00k) is an information disclosure vulnerability in Broadcom and Cypress Wi-Fi chips that allows an adjacent attacker to decrypt a small amount of traffic sent immediately after a Wi-Fi device disconnects, by using a static encryption key.**
