Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the Elasticsearch integration within GitLab EE. Specifically, the Group Search feature, when used with Elasticsearch, improperly exposes private merge requests and issues.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is an information disclosure vulnerability. The Elasticsearch integration, designed for search functionalities, fails to respect the private nature of certain data, leading to its exposure.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthorized access to private merge requests and issues within GitLab EE. This could expose sensitive project details, code changes, or internal discussions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the Group Search feature when the Elasticsearch integration is enabled.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to have access to the GitLab instance and be able to use the Group Search functionality.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to GitLab EE and does not affect GitLab CE.
*   The vulnerability affects GitLab EE versions 11.5 and later.
*   The content notes that the vulnerability was responsibly reported by @rpadovani
*   GitLab strongly recommends upgrading affected instances to the patched versions to mitigate the vulnerability
