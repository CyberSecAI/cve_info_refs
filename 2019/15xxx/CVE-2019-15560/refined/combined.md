Just FYI, if you are not using variable newRelic in server.js. Your can change your 1st line to `require('newrelic')`

Oh nice, didn't realize that! I am going to remove it when testing my proxy server, so I will leave it for now. Good catch though!

I have the same problem using faker in k6 script. I can only manually set fake data but using faker in this file. Let me know if you have figured out how to do it.

For the fake data I don't think it really matters in this case right? The goal of the K6 stress testing is to test the latency of the POST request, not add real information to the database. That's why I just went with a few options. I delete them from my database each day after I run tests with a simple DELETE sql query.
