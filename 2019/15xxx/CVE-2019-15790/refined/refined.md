Guideline 1: First verify if the content relates to the CVE specified based on the official description
```
The provided content includes multiple sources, with some directly referencing CVE-2019-15790 and others providing context around related vulnerabilities and issues with the `apport` package.

The CVE description is `PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval` however, the provided content mentions that:

> Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user. ([CVE-2019-15790](/security/CVE-2019-15790))

This indicates that the CVE is related to Apport reading process files with elevated privileges.

Based on the content, the details for CVE-2019-15790 are:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Apport reads process-specific files under `/proc/[pid]` with elevated privileges during crash dump generation, but it does not drop privileges before doing so. Due to PID recycling, a local attacker can cause a crash, wait for the PID to be reassigned to another process and then trick Apport into reading files of the new process, potentially belonging to another user, with the privileges of the original crashed process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Privilege escalation vulnerability by reading sensitive information of privileged processes.
- Race condition due to PID recycling.
- Lack of privilege dropping when accessing `/proc/[pid]` files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A local attacker can generate a crash report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user, leading to information disclosure.
- Specifically, the attacker can obtain the ASLR offsets for a privileged process by crashing the service and then reading the memory map (`/proc/[pid]/maps`) from the generated crash report after it has restarted, which is useful for exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- A local attacker needs to be able to trigger a crash of a privileged process.
- The attacker needs to be able to pause Apport while it is generating the crash report. This was achieved in the proof-of-concept exploit by exploiting another vulnerability: A user controllable lock file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local user account with the ability to trigger crashes of privileged processes.
- The ability to pause Apport to cause a PID reuse.
- The attacker does not require root access to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the `add_proc_info` function of apport when creating crash reports.
- The fix includes dropping privileges before adding process information and using file descriptors when accessing /proc/pid files.

The content also reveals that the fix for this CVE had caused a regression that was later fixed:
- `USN-4171-3` & `USN-4171-4`: These notices indicate that USN-4171-1 had a regression introduced in the python apport library after the fix for CVE-2019-15790. This regression is fixed in subsequent releases.
- `Bug #1850929`: Details the python3-apport regression, where a missing argument in the `Report.add_proc_environ` call was causing issues.
- `Bug #1851806`: Shows that the fix for CVE-2019-15790 introduced an `AttributeError` because `os.O_PATH` is not available in python2. The fix implements the use of file descriptors for accessing `/proc/pid` only when running under python3.
- `Bug #1854237`: Demonstrates the regression caused by the security fixes, where autopkgtests failed because of permission drops. It mentions that `test_crash_setuid_*` were failing because the tests were using the vulnerable behavior. It was later fixed by fetching the executable path from the kernel instead of using `/proc/[pid]/exe` to prevent privilege issues.
