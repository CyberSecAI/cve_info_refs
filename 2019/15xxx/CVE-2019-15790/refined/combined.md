## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

USN-4171-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in apport. This update provides

the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings

file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly

crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. ([CVE-2019-11481](/security/CVE-2019-11481))

Sander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump

creation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report

for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11482](/security/CVE-2019-11482))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from

containers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash

report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11483](/security/CVE-2019-11483))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be

used by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.

([CVE-2019-11485](/security/CVE-2019-11485))

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with

elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used

by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process

that is readable by an unprivileged user. ([CVE-2019-15790](/security/CVE-2019-15790))

### Bug Description

Dear Ubuntu Security Team,

I would like to report a vulnerability in Apport, which enables an unprivileged user to read important information about a privileged process.

From an attacker's point of view, the main value of the vulnerability is that it enables them to obtain the ASLR offsets for a privileged process, provided that they have the ability to deliberately crash the privileged process. This is very useful for an attacker if they have discovered a memory corruption vulnerability in a privileged service. It is often very difficult to obtain code execution from a memory corruption vulnerability unless you have access to the ASLR offsets. But it is usually very easy to trigger a crash by corrupting the memory with random data. The vulnerability in Apport enables the attacker to obtain the ASLR offsets for the service after it is has restarted due to an attacker-controlled crash.

I have attached an exploit proof of concept which demonstrates the vulnerability on the whoopsie process. As you know, whoopsie has a memory corruption vulnerability which is currently still unfixed: 1830865. The vulnerability in whoopsie is very difficult to exploit without knowing the ASLR offsets. But it is easy for an unprivileged user to cause whoopsie to crash. The PoC uses this to deliberately crash whoopsie and obtain ASLR offsets for the new whoopsie after it has been restarted automatically by systemd.

To run the PoC:

gunzip Apport\_PoC.tar.gz

tar -xf Apport\_PoC.tar

cd Apport\_PoC/

make

./restart\_whoopsie init 10

The PoC is slightly non-deterministic, so it might take several tries before it succeeds. (It will print messages to tell you what is going on while it is running.) When it succeeds, Apport will create a file named something like this:

/var/crash/\_usr\_bin\_whoopsie.1001.crash

If you run apport-unpack on that crash report then you will see that it contains the ProcMaps file for the currently running whoopsie.

The source of the problem is here:

[https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/tree/data/apport?h=applied/ubuntu/bionic-devel&id=20c98691144e843bf1ab8428603beedd34e993ad#n452](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport/tree/data/apport?h=applied/ubuntu/bionic-devel&id=20c98691144e843bf1ab8428603beedd34e993ad#n452)

Apport determines which user the crashed process belongs to by reading the contents of /proc/[pid]. But pids can get recycled. The exploit works by pausing Apport while it is in the middle of generating a crash report and then sending a SIGKILL to the crashed process so that its pid gets recycled. When Apport resumes, it starts generating a crash report for a new process which has been assigned the same pid as the crashed process.

I am happy to help out if you would like to discuss what the best solution is for this vulnerability. I have some ideas, but they might be naive. This is a very tricky area of the code and I am sure that I am not yet aware of all the subtle reasons why it is currently written the way it is.

Please let me know when you have fixed the vulnerability, so that I can coordinate my disclosure with yours. For reference, here is a link to Semmle's vulnerability disclosure policy: <https://lgtm.com/security#disclosure_policy>

Thank you,

Kevin Backhouse

Hi Kev,

Not yet - Seth can you please assign one?

Kev, there seems to be a few different issues here - the lock file being able to be controlled by a regular user means they can control the execution of Apport which makes your exploit workable, but I get the feeling that whilst this is clearly an issue, that even if we mitigate this there is still the issue that Apport could be made to race against PID reuse anyway and so it seems this is still worthy of it's own CVE. I am wondering if it would be sufficient to have Apport NOT set the real process ID when doing the initial drop\_privileges() but to instead set the effective user ID only (or perhaps the file-system user ID only here) - then you would not be able to pause it as a regular user (but I am not familiar enough with the rest of Apport to know if this will break other parts of it).

Also we could perhaps try and do some checking when writing out the crash file that the PID which we are writing out still has the same user ID as the one which we originally were called for (and this is already available in the real\_pid variable).

I would be keen to get your thoughts on these ideas and perhaps any other thoughts you might have on how best to resolve this.

Hi Alex,

Yes, I agree: the lock file being controllable by a regular user is not the vulnerability. It's useful for writing an exploit, but it's not a vulnerability by itself.

As far as I can see, PID recycling means that there is fundamentally no way for apport to confirm that the contents of /proc/[pid] correspond to the process that actually crashed. So I think the only thing that you can do is to make sure that the files in /proc/[pid] are owned by the correct user. It would still be possible to play games with PID recycling but there would be no benefit to attacker if it doesn't enable them to read information belonging to a different user. So my suggestion would be to drop privileges during add\_proc\_info:

[https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apport/tree/apport/report.py?h=applied/ubuntu/bionic-devel&id=20c98691144e843bf1ab8428603beedd34e993ad#n507](https://git.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport/tree/apport/report.py?h=applied/ubuntu/bionic-devel&id=20c98691144e843bf1ab8428603beedd34e993ad#n507)

I think that should prevent apport from reading the /proc/[pid]/maps file of a process that belongs to the wrong user.

Thanks,

Kev

My apologies Kev, all, I hadn't realized I missed this one when assigning CVEs earlier.

I'm not sure what the flaw is.

I'm also not sure about the fix:

- line 455: drop\_privileges(True)

- line 500: info.add\_proc\_info(pid)

so privileges are partially dropped at this point already, no?

I'll feel better about assigning a CVE number once I understand a proposed fix.

Thanks

Hi Seth,

Here's my suggestion. Note that it would probably be cleaner to do this inside add\_proc\_info, rather than at the call site as I have done here. I have done it this way because it's the most concise way to present the idea. I copied the technique that Alex used to fix [bug 1830858](/bugs/1830858).

Thanks,

Kev

Here's my suggestion. Note that it would probably be cleaner to do this inside add\_proc\_info, rather than at the call site as I have done here. I have done it this way because it's the most concise way to present the idea. I copied the technique that Alex used to fix bug 1830858.
Thanks,
Kev

I was testing an approach that involved updating apport to access any files under /proc/pid using a file descriptor, which would prevent reading from recycled pid (ie. after the directory was gone any access would fail), but that got a bit messy: doing it that way required changes to the Report class and that class is also used by other tools, so I was having to update too many files. Although it is a sane thing to do, this would required a bit more design and work to be done properly.

For now I believe Kevin's fix is the better way to address this issue.

Tiago, I'd like to suggest keeping that work around, it'd be nice to be rid of the pid race in the future.

### Bug Description

The following autopkgtests fail after the recent security fixes:

log:FAIL: test\_get\_logind\_session (\_\_main\_\_.T)

log:FAIL: test\_core\_dump\_packaged (\_\_main\_\_.T)

log:FAIL: test\_core\_dump\_unpackaged (\_\_main\_\_.T)

log:FAIL: test\_crash\_setuid\_drop (\_\_main\_\_.T)

log:FAIL: test\_crash\_setuid\_keep (\_\_main\_\_.T)

log:FAIL: test\_crash\_setuid\_nonwritable\_cwd (\_\_main\_\_.T)

log:FAIL: test\_lock\_symlink (\_\_main\_\_.T)

test\_get\_logind\_session is a test failing to keep up with an API change. test\_core\_dump\_\* is failures to remove partly written core files. Both of these are easy fixes, I'll have a MP for them soon.

test\_crash\_setuid\_\* are caused by the dropping of privileges when accessing the crashing process's /proc. They seem to be testing behaviour now explicitly forbidden by the fix to be honest!

test\_lock\_symlink fails because the lock file is now always in /var/lock/apport/ and not in $APPORT\_REPORT\_DIR. I guess we could update the test, but is it really worth it after the fix?

What crashes are we missing out on now due to the security fix which is causing the "test\_crash\_setuid\_\*" tests to fail?

If directory permissions are properly setup for /var/lock/apport I'm fine with dropping the test\_lock\_symlink test.

Looking good, I'll accept this into eoan-proposed - but please, before we actually release it to eoan-updates, can you add a Regression Potential section to this bug at least? The test fixes touch more than just test-code, so this change can (in the unlikely case) introduce some unrelated regressions.

Thanks!

# USN-4171-1: Apport vulnerabilities

30 October 2019

Several security issues were fixed in Apport.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings

file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly

crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. ([CVE-2019-11481](/security/CVE-2019-11481))

Sander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump

creation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report

for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11482](/security/CVE-2019-11482))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from

containers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash

report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11483](/security/CVE-2019-11483))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be

used by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.

([CVE-2019-11485](/security/CVE-2019-11485))

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with

elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used

by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process

that is readable by an unprivileged user. ([CVE-2019-15790](/security/CVE-2019-15790))

### Bug Description

I encountered the following exception in python-apport while encountering an exception `bup` which uses `python-apport`. I'm sure that the exception lies in the responsibility of `python-apport` (the `AttributeError` stacktrace is relevant):

```

Traceback (most recent call last):

## Details

USN-4171-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Apport. The update caused a regression

in the Python Apport library. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings

file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly

crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. ([CVE-2019-11481](/security/CVE-2019-11481))

Sander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump

creation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report

for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11482](/security/CVE-2019-11482))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from

containers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash

report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11483](/security/CVE-2019-11483))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be

used by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.

([CVE-2019-11485](/security/CVE-2019-11485))

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with

elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used

by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process

that is readable by an unprivileged user. ([CVE-2019-15790](/security/CVE-2019-15790))

# USN-4171-4: Apport regression

5 November 2019

USN-4171-1 introduced a regression in Apport.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [apport](/security/cves?package=apport) - automatically generate crash reports for debugging

## Details

USN-4171-1 fixed a vulnerability in Apport. The update caused a regression

in the Python Apport library. This update fixes the problem for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport would read its user-controlled settings

file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly

crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences. ([CVE-2019-11481](/security/CVE-2019-11481))

Sander Bos discovered a race-condition in Apport during core dump

creation. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash report

for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11482](/security/CVE-2019-11482))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled crash dumps originating from

containers. This could be used by a local attacker to generate a crash

report for a privileged process that is readable by an unprivileged user.

([CVE-2019-11483](/security/CVE-2019-11483))

Sander Bos discovered Apport mishandled lock-file creation. This could be

used by a local attacker to cause a denial of service against Apport.

([CVE-2019-11485](/security/CVE-2019-11485))

Kevin Backhouse discovered Apport read various process-specific files with

elevated privileges during crash dump generation. This could could be used

by a local attacker to generate a crash report for a privileged process

that is readable by an unprivileged user. ([CVE-2019-15790](/security/CVE-2019-15790))

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

* [python-apport](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport)
  -
  [2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport/2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29%2Besm3)
* [python3-apport](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport)

  -
  [2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29+esm3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/apport/2.14.1-0ubuntu3.29%2Besm3)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
