The provided content discusses vulnerabilities in several WordPress plugins, including "nd-travel," which aligns with the CVE ID.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **nd-travel and other NicDark plugins:** The plugins registered a `nopriv_` AJAX action responsible for importing WordPress settings. This allowed unauthenticated users to send AJAX requests to modify the `siteurl` setting of the victim's site.
*   **Simple 301 Redirects – Addon – Bulk Uploader:** The plugin had a vulnerability that allowed unauthenticated users to upload a CSV file containing redirect rules and inject 301 redirect rules onto the victim's website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:**  The AJAX actions in NicDark plugins and CSV upload functionality in Simple 301 Redirects plugin were accessible to unauthenticated users.
*   **Insecure AJAX Handling:** The plugins did not properly validate or sanitize the data received through AJAX requests, allowing modification of site settings.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The bulk uploader plugin didn't validate the uploaded CSV, leading to arbitrary redirect injections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Traffic Redirection:** Attackers could redirect website visitors to malicious or attacker-controlled locations. This could lead to malware distribution, phishing attacks, or other malicious activities.
*   **JavaScript Injection:** Modifying the siteurl setting replaced all of the site's JavaScript with a file under the attacker's control. This allowed the attacker to control the user's browser behavior on the victim website.
*   **SEO poisoning:** By redirecting pages, attackers could damage the victim site's SEO ranking.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **AJAX Requests:** Unauthenticated users could send crafted AJAX requests to vulnerable plugins to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **CSV Uploads:** Unauthenticated users could upload malicious CSV files to the vulnerable plugin to inject redirect rules.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** Attackers did not need any credentials or special access to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers only needed network access to send the malicious requests or upload the malicious file.
