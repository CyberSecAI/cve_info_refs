### [I seriously doubt why this plugin is even admitted in the repository](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-seriously-doubt-why-this-plugin-is-even-admitted-in-the-repository/)

November 6, 2022

What can I say?
The plugin totally does not work on 8.0 and on 7.4 when I have the error reporting on ‚Äòfull scale‚Äô, it produces more ‚Äòdeprecated‚Äô warnings and general notifications than HTML output.
JavaScript conflicts with numerous other plugins and CSS uses very generic names conflicting with other even standard WordPress class names.
Nice try, but the creator of this plugin was clearly coding in a vacuum assuming that his plugin would be the only plugin somebody would ever need.
Don‚Äôt waste your time with this amateuristic attempt to make a plugin!

This plugin works fine as he promised, but have the worst html I‚Äôve ever seen.
All classes have a generic name, css customizations are impossible.

### [Worst code quality ever](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/worst-code-quality-ever/)

[tunnelso](https://profiles.wordpress.org/tunnelso/ "Posts by tunnelso")

Sorry to say but html outputs from this plugin have the worst code quality I‚Äôve ever seen. Everything have same class, no way to select specific element to apply custom css. If they want to apply 10px height, they have a class for that. Background white, another class for that and bla bla bla.
This is the way this plugin shows button:
<a style="border:2px solid #78635a; color:#78635a;" href=".." class="nd\_booking\_padding\_15\_30\_important nd\_options\_second\_font\_important nd\_booking\_border\_radius\_0\_important nd\_booking\_background\_color\_transparent\_important nd\_booking\_cursor\_pointer nd\_booking\_display\_inline\_block nd\_booking\_font\_size\_11 nd\_booking\_font\_weight\_bold nd\_booking\_letter\_spacing\_2" target="\_self">BOOK NOW FROM 25 $</a>
Every element have same classes but not a single unique class to identify what the element is. This makes it impossible to customize elements

Researchers warn users of several plugins to update as vulnerabilities are being actively exploited to redirect website visitor traffic.

Researchers are warning of an ongoing campaign exploiting vulnerabilities in a slew of WordPress plugins. The campaign is redirecting traffic from victims‚Äô websites to a number of potentially harmful locations.

Impacted by the campaign is a plugin called Simple 301 Redirects ‚Äì Addon ‚Äì Bulk Uploader as well as several plugins made by developer NicDark (now rebranded as ‚ÄúEndreww‚Äù). All plugins have updates available resolving the vulnerabilities ‚Äì but researchers in a [Friday post](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/08/malicious-wordpress-redirect-campaign-attacking-several-plugins/?utm_source=list&utm_source=hs_email&utm_medium=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=082319&utm_campaign=Wordfence%20Blog%20Emails&utm_content=76025071&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8127wDTYwv63KDllXVKqJB_61315A84_na2XadOvYp9yHRjy-D5nU9a3pxp8aIYLW0SnkFaaW4hbs3RXQ25S8VvZpEjSAM0yPPd8YJqEG1uJh3PH8&_hsmi=76025071) warned that WordPress users should update as soon as possible to avoid attack.

‚ÄúRedirect locations were a typical spread, whatever ad network is running it likely does some geolocation and tracking to decide where to send you,‚Äù said Mikey Veenstra with Wordfence told Threatpost. ‚ÄúMost recent injections don‚Äôt even appear to be functional, suggesting some breakdown in infrastructure or a transition of some sort.‚Äù

[![](https://media.kasperskycontenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/103/2019/02/19151457/subscribe2.jpg)](https://threatpost.com/newsletter-sign/)

Veenstra told Threatpost that exploitation began on or around July 31, just as the first disclosure for one of the vulnerabilities was published.

‚ÄúThe plugin repository team quickly removed the rest of NicDark‚Äôs plugins from the repository, which drew attention and revealed that they all suffered similar vulnerabilities,‚Äù he told Threatpost. ‚ÄúSo attacks probing for all of them began pretty quickly, despite many of the plugins having fairly small install bases.‚Äù

## Vulnerabilities

Veenstra told Threatpost that he found at least five plugins by NicDark with flaws being exploited as part of the campaign. These plugins are: [Components For WP Bakery Page Builder](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nd-shortcodes/), [Donations](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nd-donations/),[Travel Management](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nd-travel/), [Booking](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nd-booking/) and [Learning Courses](https://wordpress.org/plugins/nd-learning/).

The flaws (all recently patched) are exploited by similar AJAX requests, according to Wordfence. In each case the plugin registers a nopriv\_ AJAX action, which is responsible for importing various WordPress settings. Unauthenticated visitors can successfully send these AJAX requests in order to¬†modify the¬†`siteurl` setting of the victim‚Äôs site ‚Äì thus sending visitors to other locations.

‚ÄúThe result of this modification is that all of the victim site‚Äôs scripts will attempt to load relative to that injected path,‚Äù researchers said. ‚ÄúIn effect, this replaces all of a site‚Äôs loaded JavaScript with a file under the attacker‚Äôs control.‚Äù

The other impacted plugin, [Simple 301 Redirects ‚Äì Addon ‚Äì Bulk Uploader](https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-301-redirects-addon-bulk-uploader/), developed by Webcraftic, adds functionality to a plugin called the Simple 301 Redirects plugin, which enables the redirect of requests to another pages. The plugin has more than 10,000 installations.

The plugin has a recently-patched vulnerability that enables unauthenticated attackers to inject their own 301 redirect rules onto a victim‚Äôs website. That means that a bad actor has the ability upload a CSV file that could import a bulk set of site paths and redirect destinations.

Ultimately, if a vulnerable site processes an uploaded malicious CSV file it will begin redirecting all of its traffic to the addresses provided.

Researchers said they have also identified related attacks against other formerly-vulnerable plugins, including Woocommerce User Email Verification, Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer, Coming soon and Maintenance Mode and Blog Designer.

‚ÄúThe domains used by the attackers in performing these script injections and redirects rotate with some frequency. New domains appear every few days, and attacks involving older domains taper off,‚Äù researchers said. ‚ÄúAt this time, many of the redirect domains associated with these attacks appear to have been decommissioned, despite the fact that these domains still show up in active attacks at the time of this writing.‚Äù

Plugins continue to be a security thorn in WordPress‚Äô side. According to a Imperva [report](https://threatpost.com/threatlist-wordpress-vulnerabilities/140690/),¬†almost all (98 percent) of WordPress vulnerabilities are related to plugins that extend the functionality and features of a website or a blog. Other recent vulnerabilities found in WordPress plugins include¬†[WP Live Chat](https://threatpost.com/wordpress-wp-live-chat-support-plugin-fixes-xss-flaw/144856/)¬†and¬†[Yuzo Related Posts](https://threatpost.com/wordpress-urges-users-to-uninstall-yuzo-plugin-after-flaw-exploited/143710/).
