Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15774:

**Verification:**

The provided content from `threatpost.com` directly mentions the exploitation of vulnerabilities in several WordPress plugins, including "Booking" by NicDark, which is a likely reference to the "Hotel Booking" plugin. This aligns with the timeframe and nature of CVE-2019-15774, which involves vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins. The `wordpress.org` content is the plugin page, useful for context.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of AJAX requests in several WordPress plugins, specifically those by developer NicDark. The plugins registered `nopriv_` AJAX actions intended for importing settings. The `Simple 301 Redirects – Addon – Bulk Uploader` had a separate vulnerability, where it would process and import redirects from a file without proper validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Unauthenticated AJAX Actions:** The NicDark plugins allowed unauthenticated visitors to send AJAX requests that could modify the site's `siteurl` setting.
    *   **Insecure File Upload (Simple 301 Redirects):** The `Simple 301 Redirects – Addon – Bulk Uploader` plugin allowed the upload of a CSV file containing redirect rules without proper validation or authentication.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `siteurl` setting modification in the NicDark plugins was due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Redirected Website Traffic:** Attackers could modify the `siteurl` setting to redirect all of the victim's site scripts to an attacker controlled location or could inject 301 redirects to send users to malicious sites.
    *  **JavaScript Injection:** By changing the `siteurl`, all JavaScript files loaded by the victim site would be replaced by files from the attacker's specified path allowing malicious script execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious AJAX Requests (NicDark plugins):** Attackers could send specially crafted AJAX requests to vulnerable endpoints.
    *   **Malicious CSV Upload (Simple 301 Redirects):** Attackers could upload a CSV file containing malicious redirect rules.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacks did not require any authentication to target the vulnerable endpoints.
    *   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Plugins:** Attackers needed to identify sites running the specific vulnerable plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `threatpost.com` article mentions that the plugin repository team removed NicDark's plugins, which suggests a widespread impact.
*   The attacks were actively rotating through redirect domains, suggesting the attacks were actively being carried out.
*   The identified vulnerabilities were patched in updates for the mentioned plugins.
*  The `wordpress.org` plugin page for the `Hotel Booking` plugin confirms that a Local File Inclusion vulnerability was fixed in version 3.6. This may or may not be related to the same issue described in the article, but it is in the same timeframe.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-15774 describes a vulnerability stemming from insecure AJAX actions and file uploads that were actively exploited in multiple WordPress plugins. The exploit allowed attackers to redirect site traffic, potentially inject malicious scripts and compromise websites.
