{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `do_export()` function in the `WF_CustomerImpExpCsv_Exporter` class of the WordPress plugin 'Import Export Users' does not sanitize user-provided data before exporting it to a CSV file. Specifically, it doesn't check if the first character of fields like `display_name`, `first_name`, and `last_name` begins with characters that can lead to CSV injection attacks ( =, +, -, @).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSV Injection",
      "Lack of Input Sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious user with basic WordPress permissions (like 'subscriber') can inject commands into CSV files exported by an administrator through the vulnerable plugin. When opened with a spreadsheet application, these commands can be executed on the administrator's computer, potentially leading to remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "A subscriber-level user can modify their `display_name`, `first_name`, or `last_name` fields with a malicious payload. An administrator must then export the user data using the vulnerable plugin, and open the generated CSV file in a spreadsheet application.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs basic access to the WordPress site (subscriber role), and the administrator needs to export the user data through the vulnerable plugin and then open the generated CSV file with a vulnerable application (like MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc)."
