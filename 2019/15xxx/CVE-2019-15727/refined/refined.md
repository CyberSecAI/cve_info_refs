- **Root cause of vulnerability:** GitLab displays metric changes in merge request widgets regardless of the user's CI access permissions. This is because the JSON endpoint `/metrics_report.json` exposes the metrics data without proper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Inadequate access control on the metrics data, specifically on the `/metrics_report.json` endpoint, allows unauthorized users to view CI metrics.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can access CI metrics, which might contain sensitive information or insights into the project's build process.
- **Attack vectors:** By visiting the merge request page and/or directly accessing the `/metrics_report.json` endpoint, an anonymous user can view metrics data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to view the public project's merge request page or know the URL to the `/metrics_report.json` endpoint. No authentication is needed.
