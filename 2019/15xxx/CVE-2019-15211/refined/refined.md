(CVE) ID: CVE-2019-15211
CVE Description: An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.2.6. There is a use-after-free caused by a malicious USB device in the drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-dev.c driver because drivers/media/radio/radio-raremono.c does not properly allocate memory.

Root cause of vulnerability: The radio-raremono driver uses `devm_kzalloc` which is automatically freed upon usb device disconnect. If there are still unresolved references to the radio device during disconnect, it can lead to use-after-free.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use-after-free

Impact of exploitation: Denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly privilege escalation.

Attack vectors: A physically proximate attacker able to add and remove USB devices.

Required attacker capabilities/position: Ability to connect a malicious USB device to the system.
