{
  "CVE-2019-15927": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The parser for the processing unit reads bNrInPins field before the bLength sanity check, which may lead to an out-of-bounds access when a malformed descriptor is given.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read due to missing bLength check in `build_audio_procunit` function in `sound/usb/mixer.c`.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds read, which could lead to a denial-of-service, information disclosure or possibly arbitrary code execution.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malformed USB audio device descriptor, sent to the kernel.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be able to plug in a malicious USB audio device into a vulnerable machine."
  },
  "CVE-2019-15926": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Out-of-bounds array access due to missing bounds check in the functions ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx and ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx in the file drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath6kl/wmi.c",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds array access in ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx and ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx functions",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service (system crash)",
    "Attack vectors": "By sending specially crafted packets over the wireless interface.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker must be within wireless range or able to inject packets."
