## Details

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo,

Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz

Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss, and Jo Van Bulck discovered that Intel

processors using Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX) could

expose memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers to a

malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core. A local attacker

could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11135](/security/CVE-2019-11135))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets allowed userspace

to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command

Streamer and expose kernel memory information. A local attacker could use

this to expose sensitive information or possibly elevate privileges.

([CVE-2019-0155](/security/CVE-2019-0155))

Deepak Gupta discovered that on certain Intel processors, the Linux kernel

did not properly perform invalidation on page table updates by virtual

guest operating systems. A local attacker in a guest VM could use this to

cause a denial of service (host system crash). ([CVE-2018-12207](/security/CVE-2018-12207))

It was discovered that the Intel i915 graphics chipsets could cause a

system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input

output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2019-0154](/security/CVE-2019-0154))

Jann Horn discovered a reference count underflow in the shiftfs

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-15791](/security/CVE-2019-15791))

Jann Horn discovered a type confusion vulnerability in the shiftfs

implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to

cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-15792](/security/CVE-2019-15792))

Jann Horn discovered that the shiftfs implementation in the Linux kernel

did not use the correct file system uid/gid when the user namespace of a

lower file system is not in the init user namespace. A local attacker could

use this to possibly bypass DAC permissions or have some other unspecified

impact. ([CVE-2019-15793](/security/CVE-2019-15793))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the 802.11 Wi-Fi

configuration interface for the Linux kernel when handling beacon settings.

A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)

or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-16746](/security/CVE-2019-16746))

Nico Waisman discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the Realtek Wi-Fi

driver for the Linux kernel when handling Notice of Absence frames. A

physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-17666](/security/CVE-2019-17666))

Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915

(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics

firmware updates respectively.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to

make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

use this to possibly bypass DAC permissions or have some other unspecified

impact. ([CVE-2019-15793](/security/CVE-2019-15793))

Ori Nimron discovered that the AX25 network protocol implementation in the

Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local attacker

could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17052](/security/CVE-2019-17052))

Ori Nimron discovered that the IEEE 802.15.4 Low-Rate Wireless network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

([CVE-2019-17053](/security/CVE-2019-17053))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Appletalk network protocol implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17054](/security/CVE-2019-17054))

Ori Nimron discovered that the modular ISDN network protocol implementation

in the Linux kernel did not properly perform permissions checks. A local

attacker could use this to create a raw socket. ([CVE-2019-17055](/security/CVE-2019-17055))

Ori Nimron discovered that the Near field Communication (NFC) network

protocol implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly perform

permissions checks. A local attacker could use this to create a raw socket.

Please note that mitigating the TSX (CVE-2019-11135) and i915

(CVE-2019-0154) issues requires corresponding microcode and graphics

firmware updates respectively.

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

UBUNTU: SAUCE: shiftfs: Correct id translation for lower fs operationsBugLink: https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1850867
Several locations which shift ids translate user/group ids before
performing operations in the lower filesystem are translating
them into init\_user\_ns, whereas they should be translated into
the s\_user\_ns for the lower filesystem. This will result in using
ids other than the intended ones in the lower fs, which will
likely not map into the shifts s\_user\_ns.
Change these sites to use shift\_k[ug]id() to do a translation
into the s\_user\_ns of the lower filesystem.

## [TAA\_MCEPSC\_i915](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/TAA_MCEPSC_i915)

## TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA, CVE-2019-11135), Intel® Processor Machine Check Error (MCEPSC, CVE-2018-12207), and i915 graphics (CVE-2019-0155, CVE-2019-0154) vulnerabilities

### TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA, CVE-2019-11135) vulnerability

Stephan van Schaik, Alyssa Milburn, Sebastian Österlund, Pietro Frigo, Kaveh Razavi, Herbert Bos, Cristiano Giuffrida, Giorgi Maisuradze, Moritz Lipp, Michael Schwarz, Daniel Gruss and Jo Van Bulck discovered that memory contents previously stored in microarchitectural buffers of an Intel CPU core may be exposed to a malicious process that is executing on the same CPU core via a speculative execution side-channel, a similar vulnerability to [Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)](/SecurityTeam/KnowledgeBase/MDS). The TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA) vulnerability allows an attacker to access the same buffers (store buffer, fill buffer, load port writeback data bus) as MDS, but through Intel® Transactional Synchronization Extensions (Intel® TSX). As a result, unintended memory exposure can occur between userspace processes, between the kernel and userspace, between virtual machines, or between a virtual machine and the host environment.

This issue only affects processors that support Intel® TSX. For processors that support Intel® TSX and were previously affected by MDS, the existing MDS buffer clearing mitigations also mitigate TAA, and no additional mitigations are needed.

For processors that support Intel® TSX and were not affected by MDS, TAA is mitigated by disabling Intel® TSX. Deployments that require Intel® TSX can enable it with the tsx=on kernel command-line parameter and microarchitectural buffer clearing mitigations, such as those used to mitigate MDS, will be used to mitigate TAA.

Mitigations for processors vulnerable to TAA are provided by a combination of processor microcode and Linux kernel updates.

For more details, including affected processor families, please see the [Intel TAA Deep Dive](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-intel-transactional-synchronization-extensions-intel-tsx-asynchronous-abort).

For details on how to check the system status and configure the software mitigations, please see the [Linux Kernel TSX Asynchronous Abort Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html).
### Intel® Processor Machine Check Error (MCEPSC, CVE-2018-12207) vulnerability

Intel researchers discovered that a race condition existed in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) when converting 4K pages to 2MB or larger pages (called hugepages in Linux kernel parlance) that could generate a Machine Check Exception (MCE), resulting in a denial of service (system hang or shutdown). A malicious virtual machine could use this flaw to generate an MCE resulting in a denial of service of the host OS, including all other virtual machines.

There is no known attack vector when virtualization is not in use.

Mitigations for this issue are provided through updates to the Linux kernel.

This issue is also known as Machine Check Exception on Page Size Changes (MCEPSC). The Linux kernel refers to this issue as iTLB multihit.

For more details, including affected processor families, please see the [Intel MCEPSC Deep Dive](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change-0)

For details on how to check the system status and configure the software mitigations, please see the [Linux Kernel iTLB Multihit Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/multihit.html).

### Intel i915 graphics (CVE-2019-0155, CVE-2019-0154) vulnerabilities

#### CVE-2019-0154

Intel researchers discovered that Intel graphics processors could cause a system hang when userspace performed a read from GT memory mapped input output (MMIO) when the product is in certain low power states. A local user could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang).

Mitigations for this issue are provided through updates to the firmware for the graphics processor and the kernel drivers.

#### CVE-2019-0155

Intel researchers discovered that Intel graphics processors allowed userspace to modify page table entries via writes to MMIO from the Blitter Command Streamer and exposed kernel memory information, resulting in possible privilege escalation and information disclosure vulnerabilities. A local user could use this issue to escalate their privileges on the local machine.

Mitigations for this issue are provided through updates to the kernel drivers.

It was discovered late that the proposed fixes for this issue were incomplete in Ubuntu 64-bit x86 kernels. A [followup update](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux/%2Bbug/1852141) was issued for affected kernels.

## Mitigations

### Public Cloud Image updates

* Amazon AWS: <IN PROGRESS>
* Windows Azure: <IN PROGRESS>
* Google Compute Engine: <IN PROGRESS>
* Ubuntu Core Images: <IN PROGRESS>

Cloud Images dailies will start appearing within 4 hours of the USN announcement. At the direction of the security team, the Cloud Image Team will start manually releasing new images to the public cloud.

## Checking System Status

Updated Ubuntu kernels have the ability to report how the system is currently affected by TAA and MCEPSC. You must apply the latest kernel updates and reboot before the kernel can indicate the status of each issue.

### TSX Asynchronous Abort (TAA, CVE-2019-11135) Status

To check your system, read the contents of the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx\_async\_abort file.

Processors that aren't vulnerable to TAA will report the following:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Not affected
```

You may encounter a situation where you have an updated Ubuntu kernel but you don't have updated microcode. This could occur if you've not updated to the latest intel-microcode package or if Intel has not released new microcode for your processor. You'll see the following in this situation:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Vulnerable: Clear CPU buffers attempted, no microcode; SMT vulnerable
```

On systems that support disabling TSX, it will be specified as the mitigation for TAA:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: TSX disabled
```

When TSX cannot be disabled or if TSX has been explicitly enabled by the system administrator, processors that have Hyper-Threading support will indicate that SMT is vulnerable:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT vulnerable
```

When TSX cannot be disabled or if TSX has been explicitly enabled by the system administrator and Intel Hyper-Threading is not support or has been disabled, the file will contain the following contents

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT disabled
```

The kernel is unable to reliably determine whether Hyper-Threading is enabled when running in a virtual environment. Updated host kernel packages, updated host qemu packages with proper configuration to pass through the host CPU type to the guest, and updated guest kernel packages will show the following status inside of the virtual environment:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/tsx_async_abort
  Mitigation: Clear CPU buffers; SMT Host state unknown
```

The examples above cover the most common situations. Please see the [Linux Kernel TAA Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/tsx_async_abort.html) for additional, less common situations.

### Intel® Processor Machine Check Error (MCEPSC, CVE-2018-12207) Status

To check your system, read the contents of the /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb\_multihit file. The lack of the itlb\_multihit file indicates that the kernel is not updated and that the system is most likely vulnerable to MCEPSC. In general, all non-Atom processors that support Extended Page Tables (EPT) are vulnerable. The full list is documented in the [Intel MCEPSC Deep Dive](https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/insights/deep-dive-machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change-0).

Processors that aren't vulnerable to MCEPSC will report the following:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  Not affected
```

The following example indicates that MCEPSC is mitigated:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  KVM: Mitigation: Split huge pages
```

The file will indicate that the system is vulnerable when the MCEPSC mitigation is disabled:

```
  $ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/vulnerabilities/itlb_multihit
  KVM: Vulnerable
```

The examples above cover the most common situations. Please see the [Linux Kernel iTLB Multihit Admin Guide](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/hw-vuln/multihit.html) for additional, less common situations.
