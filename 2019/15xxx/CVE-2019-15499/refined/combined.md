## Description

![@Ry0taK](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/49341894?u=a8875b42683d48227c67dba7c14240963a9d6603&v=4&size=48)[Ry0taK](https://github.com/Ry0taK)opened [on Aug 21, 2019](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/1263#issue-483327896)
## Summary

This is similar issue to [#959](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/959), but different cause.

Due to `sandbox` attribute is allowed, attacker can redirect victim to something malicious if attacker embeds iframe with `allow-top-navigation` in `sandbox` attribute.

[#959](https://github.com/hackmdio/codimd/issues/959) won't work in Chrome because of their security, but this will work due to `sandbox` is whitelist attribute.

This will be XSS in Safari by using data scheme.

## Step to reproduce

1. Type `<iframe src="https://example.com/hackmd.html" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-scripts"></iframe>` in Editor. (It doesn't work because my domain is expired.)
2. View edited page.

## CVE

[CVE-2019-15499](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-15499)

## Suggested fix

Don't allow `sandbox` attribute in public/js/render.js.
