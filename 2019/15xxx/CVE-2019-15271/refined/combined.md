The attacker must have either a valid credential or an active session token.  The vulnerability is due to lack of input validation of the HTTP payload. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the web-based management interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute commands with *root* privileges.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20191106-sbrv-cmd-x>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco Small Business RV Series Routers if they are running a firmware release earlier than 4.2.3.10:    + RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router1   + RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router   + RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router   + RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router1 1. The Cisco RV016 Multi-WAN VPN Router and RV082 Dual WAN VPN Router have reached the end of software maintenance. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco RV320 and RV325 Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Routers.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  However, administrators can reduce the attack surface by disabling the Remote Management feature if there is no operational requirement to use it. Note that the feature is disabled by default.  Administrators can disable the Remote Management feature by choosing **Firewall > General** and unchecking the **Remote Management** check box. Disabling the feature will disable the web-based management interface on the WAN IP address, which is reachable through the WAN ports. The interface will still be available on the LAN IP address, which is reachable through the LAN ports.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories and Alerts page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Cisco fixed this vulnerability in firmware releases 4.2.3.10 and later for the Cisco RV042 Dual WAN VPN Router and RV042G Dual Gigabit WAN VPN Router.  Customers can download the firmware from the [Software Center](https://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html) on Cisco.com by doing the following:    1. Click **Browse all**.   2. Choose **Routers > Small Business Routers > Small Business RV Series Routers**.   3. Choose a specific product from the right pane of the product selector.   4. Click **Small Business Router Firmware**.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * In June 2022, the Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) became aware of additional attempted exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. Cisco continues to strongly recommend that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this vulnerability.  Source  * Cisco would like to thank security researcher Michel Gaschet--Clousier of Orange Cyberd√©fense for reporting this vulnerability.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV:¬†Local AV:¬†Adjacent AV:¬†Network AV:¬†Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC:¬†Low AC:¬†High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR:¬†None PR:¬†Low PR:¬†High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI:¬†Required UI:¬†None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S:¬†Unchanged S:¬†Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C:¬†None C:¬†Low C:¬†High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I:¬†None I:¬†Low I:¬†High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A:¬†None A:¬†Low A:¬†High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E:¬†Unproven  E:¬†Proof-of-Concept  E:¬†Functional  E:¬†High  E:¬†Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL:¬†Official-Fix  RL:¬†Temporary-Fix  RL:¬†Workaround  RL:¬†Unavailable  RL:¬†Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC:¬†Unknown  RC:¬†Reasonable  RC:¬†Confirmed  RC:¬†Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR:¬†Low  CR:¬†Medium  CR:¬†Not Defined  CR:¬†High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR:¬†Low  IR:¬†Medium  IR:¬†Not Defined  IR:¬†High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR:¬†Low  AR:¬†Medium  AR:¬†Not Defined  AR:¬†High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV:¬†Local  MAV:¬†Adjacent  MAV:¬†Network  MAV:¬†Physical  MAV:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC:¬†Low  MAC:¬†High  MAC:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR:¬†None  MPR:¬†Low  MPR:¬†High  MPR:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI:¬†Required  MUI:¬†None  MUI:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS:¬†Unchanged  MS:¬†Changed  MS:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC:¬†None  MC:¬†Low  MC:¬†High  MC:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI:¬†None  MI:¬†Low  MI:¬†High  MI:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA:¬†None  MA:¬†Low  MA:¬†High  MA:¬†Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.8 |
