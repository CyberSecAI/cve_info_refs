Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15549:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `asn1_der` crate's handling of ASN.1 DER encoded data. Specifically, the crate would preallocate a vector based on the length field specified in the DER data without proper checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unchecked Length:** The core weakness was the lack of validation on the length field before allocating memory. This allowed an attacker to specify an arbitrarily large length value.
- **Memory Exhaustion:** By providing a crafted DER payload with a large length field, an attacker could force the application to attempt to allocate an excessive amount of memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a denial-of-service condition. The attempted large memory allocation leads to a SIGABRT (signal abort), crashing the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by an attacker supplying a maliciously crafted DER message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special privileges required:** An attacker does not need any prior privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- **No user interaction required:** The attack can be performed without any user interaction.
- **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable application.

**Summary of Technical Details:**

The vulnerability lies in the `asn1_der` crate's deserialization process. When deserializing bytes, the code reads the length field from the DER data, and uses this to allocate a buffer `data_buf` using the announced length value. An attacker can provide a crafted DER payload with a length field that specifies a very large value, leading to an allocation failure and subsequent program crash (SIGABRT). The fix was to remove the preallocation of memory.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- The affected versions of the `asn1_der` crate are prior to 0.6.2.
- The vulnerability is also tracked as GHSA-v5r6-6r3c-wqxc and RUSTSEC-2019-0007.
- A sample code to reproduce the vulnerability is given in the github issue #1.
- The issue was corrected by not preallocating memory.
