Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the CVE-2019-15651 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** One-byte heap-overread
*   **Location:** `wolfcrypt/src/asn.c:7584`
*   **Root Cause:** A corner case mishandling in `GetLength_ex(wolfcrypt/src/asn.c:189)` leads to a buffer overread in `DecodeCertExtensions` at `wolfcrypt/src/asn.c:7584`.
*   **Weakness:** The `GetLength_ex` function checks if `idx + length > maxIdx`. However, if `idx + length == maxIdx`, the check passes, but a subsequent access to `input[idx]` in `DecodeCertExtensions` can result in reading beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically, the code attempts to read a byte from the input buffer at the index `idx` to determine if it is an ASN\_BOOLEAN type.
*   **Attack Vector:** Loading a specially crafted DER certificate using the API `wolfSSL_X509_d2i` (or the example\_cert\_parsing\_app) triggers the vulnerability. The provided `test_crt.zip` contains a sample certificate to reproduce the issue.
*   **Impact:** Heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious DER certificate to the vulnerable code.
