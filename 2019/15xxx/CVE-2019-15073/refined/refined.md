The provided content contains information about CVE-2019-15073.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by an open redirect in the `/cgi-bin/go` script, specifically due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `ACTION` parameter.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect vulnerability: An attacker can manipulate the `ACTION` parameter to redirect users to an arbitrary malicious website.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user input, specifically the `ACTION` parameter.
- Pre-authentication vulnerability: The redirection can be triggered without requiring any prior user authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Redirection of users to malicious websites: An attacker can trick users into visiting a phishing page or any other harmful website by using the vulnerable redirect. This could lead to credential theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
- Social Engineering attacks: Attackers can use this vulnerability in combination with social engineering tactics to further exploit users, as a link to a trusted webmail system can be crafted with a malicious redirect included.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious URL with the `ACTION` parameter set to the desired malicious URL and then tricking a user into clicking the URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL containing a malicious value for the ACTION parameter. The attacker can be remote and unauthenticated.
