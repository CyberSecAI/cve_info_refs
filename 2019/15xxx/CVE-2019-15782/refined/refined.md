The provided content relates to CVE-2019-15782.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of torrent metadata (name, path, file names) when displayed on the HTTP server's index page. Specifically, the server was not HTML-escaping untrusted torrent metadata. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via specially crafted torrent titles or file names.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Lack of HTML escaping of user-controlled data.
- Insufficient security headers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser context.
- The attacker could potentially gain access to information about the content being downloaded.
- Possible exfiltration of user data to an external server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Attacker creates a torrent with a specially crafted title or filename containing malicious JavaScript.
- User starts the WebTorrent HTTP server using `torrent.createServer()`.
- User visits the server's index page, which displays the torrent's file list.
- The malicious JavaScript embedded in the torrent metadata is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create and distribute torrent files.
- User must be running the WebTorrent HTTP server.
- User must access the HTTP server's index page.

**Mitigation:**
- HTML-escaping untrusted torrent metadata (name, path, file names, etc.)
- Implementation of a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that prevents all connections, scripts, styles, plugins, and frames.
- Setting security headers on `/favicon.ico` responses.
