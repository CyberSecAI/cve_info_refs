### @feross **[feross](/feross)** commented [Aug 27, 2019](#issue-486017892) • edited Loading

Low risk xss. If the torrent contains a specially crafted title or file name, and a user running WebTorrent in Node.js starts the HTTP server via `torrent.createServer()`, and then the user visits the HTTP server's index page (which lists the files in the torrent), then the attacker can run JavaScript in this browser context.

This seems relatively low risk since the WebTorrent HTTP server only allows fetching data pieces from the torrent. So an attack that interacts with the HTTP server cannot control the torrent client or execute any code. They can only fetch data pieces from the torrent. So, attacker code could e.g. figure out what content the user is downloading and exfiltrate that to an external server.

This PR mitigates the issue in two ways (either of which could have prevented this XSS on its own):

1. HTML-escape untrusted torrent metadata (name, path, file names, etc.)
2. Add the strictest possible CSP to prevent all connections, scripts, styles, plugins, frames. Every capability is denied.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Commits on Aug 27, 2019

1. [Fix http server XSS](/webtorrent/webtorrent/commit/22546df6d9ba9ca4523142d98b5e70f6db213f3e)
    …

   ```
   Low risk xss. If the torrent contains a specially crafted title or file name, and the user starts the WebTorrent HTTP server via createServer(), and then the user visits the HTTP server index page (which lists the contents of the torrent), then the attacker can run JavaScript in this browser context.

   The reason this seems relatively low risk is that the WebTorrent HTTP server only allows fetching data pieces from the torrent. It doesn't support any other control of the torrent client. So, attacker code could e.g. figure out what content the user is downloading and exfiltrate that to an external domain.

   This commit mitigates the issue in two ways (either of which could have prevented this XSS on its own):

   1. HTML-escape untrusted torrent metadata (name, path, file names, etc.)

   2. Add the strictest possible CSP to prevent all connections, scripts, styles, plugins, frames. Every capability is denied.
   ```
