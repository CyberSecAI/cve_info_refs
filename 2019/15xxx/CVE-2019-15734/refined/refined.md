- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the fact that GitLab sends notifications to users when they are directly mentioned (using `@`username) in comments or threads, even if the user is not a member of the project where the comment was made and the project visibility is internal.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure vulnerability. GitLab does not properly restrict access to commit information and comments when a user is directly mentioned.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to information they should not have access to, including: team member names, commit IDs, and the content of comments that directly mention the attacker. This information is intended for project members.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1. The attacker must have a GitLab account.
    2. The attacker must subscribe to all events of the victim user via the victim's profile page.
    3. A user within a private/internal project must mention the attacker in a commit comment using `@` followed by the attacker's username.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs a valid GitLab account and must subscribe to all events of the targeted victim user. They do not need to be a member of the project.
