Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation within the Command Line Interface (CLI) of Cisco Unity Express. Specifically, certain CLI commands are not properly sanitized before being executed by the underlying operating system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. An attacker can insert arbitrary operating system commands into the CLI input, which are then executed by the system.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:**  The lack of proper input validation on CLI commands is the root cause that allows for the command injection vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.
- **Privilege Escalation:** This arbitrary command execution leads to the attacker gaining root-level privileges on the affected system, allowing them complete control.
- **System Compromise:** The attacker can fully compromise the vulnerable system with root access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
- **CLI Interface:** The attack is carried out via the CLI interface.
- **Crafted CLI commands:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending crafted malicious commands through the CLI interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid administrator-level credentials on the Cisco Unity Express system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the command line interface of the affected system.
- **Knowledge of CLI:** Requires knowledge of command line syntax and how to inject OS commands within the system's CLI.

**Additional Notes:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Unity Express releases prior to version 10.1 are affected.
- **No Workarounds:** There are no available workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading the software.
- **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability was fixed in Cisco Unity Express release 10.1 and later.
- **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score for this vulnerability is 6.7 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating a high impact for a local attack with high privileges.
