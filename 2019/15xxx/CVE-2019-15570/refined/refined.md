The provided content is related to CVE-2019-15570.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of relation parameters when saving or updating relations within the application. Specifically, the encoded JSON data containing the parameters was not being escaped, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-provided input when handling relation parameters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject custom SQL code by adding an apostrophe character (') to a relation parameter. This could lead to the exposure of arbitrary data from any table in the database.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of relation parameters when linking entities (e.g., Documents and Images). Specifically, when a user attempts to link two objects with a parameter such as "label", the lack of sanitization on the label parameter would allow for SQL injection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to interact with the functionality that saves relations with parameters. They would also need to know the format in which these parameters are accepted to craft the malicious payload.
