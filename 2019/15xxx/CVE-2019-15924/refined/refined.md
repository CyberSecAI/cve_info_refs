CVE-2019-15924
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `fm10k_init_module` function in the Intel fm10k Ethernet driver lacks error handling for `alloc_workqueue` failures, leading to a potential null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Missing error check for `alloc_workqueue` failure.
- Potential null pointer dereference.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (kernel crash/oops)

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access, likely requiring the ability to load/unload kernel modules.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access with the ability to load or manipulate kernel modules or devices.
```
CVE-2019-15926
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ath6kl` WiFi driver does not properly validate traffic class numbers in received control packets.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of consistent validation of traffic class numbers in `ath6kl_wmi_pstream_timeout_event_rx` and `ath6kl_wmi_cac_event_rx` functions.
- Out-of-bounds memory access due to invalid traffic class number.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (memory corruption or crash).
- Potential privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network attack by a nearby attacker on the same Wi-Fi network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be nearby and on the same Wi-Fi network as the victim.
```
CVE-2019-15927
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The `build_audio_procunit` function in `sound/usb/mixer.c` has an out-of-bounds access issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds memory access in the `build_audio_procunit` function.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (memory corruption or crash).
- Potential privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access, possibly via a malicious USB device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local attacker with the ability to use malicious or crafted USB devices
```
CVE-2019-9456
```
**Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing bounds check in the USB monitor driver on Pixel C devices could allow an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Missing bounds check in the USB monitor driver, which may result in an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access and execution privileges

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- System execution privileges are needed, user interaction is not needed.
