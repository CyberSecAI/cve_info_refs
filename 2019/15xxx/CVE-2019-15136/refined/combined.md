> Abstract:Distribution Service (DDS) is a realtime peer-to-peer protocol that serves as a scalable middleware between distributed networked systems found in many Industrial IoT domains such as automotive, medical, energy, and defense. Since the initial ratification of the standard, specifications have introduced a Security Model and Service Plugin Interface (SPI) architecture, facilitating authenticated encryption and data centric access control while preserving interoperable data exchange. However, as Secure DDS v1.1, the default plugin specifications presently exchanges digitally signed capability lists of both participants in the clear during the crypto handshake for permission attestation; thus breaching confidentiality of the context of the connection. In this work, we present an attacker model that makes use of network reconnaissance afforded by this leaked context in conjunction with formal verification and model checking to arbitrarily reason about the underlying topology and reachability of information flow, enabling targeted attacks such as selective denial of service, adversarial partitioning of the data bus, or vulnerability excavation of vendor implementations.

## Description

![@ruffsl](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2293573?v=4&size=48)[ruffsl](https://github.com/ruffsl)opened [on Mar 8, 2019](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/443#issue-418611926)

Partition permissions are presently only checked when creating local data readers/writers, and are consequently skipped when checking *remote* readers/writers within the current default Access Control plugin implementation. This effectively nullifies any permission restrictions mandated in the remote participant's permission file, given it must be checked locally to ensure any access control policy is faithfully enforced.

The flowing is a minimal example where only the partition permission checks for creating local data readers/writers are disabled for testing, while leaving the `check_remote_datawriter` and `check_remote_datareader` fully intact. The secure publisher and subscriber are altered to connect over a common partition that is non existent in either of the participant's permissions, i.e. the only valid partition allowed by the permission policy is that of the empty string. Such altered fast-rtps publisher and subscriber while successfully connect with each other, while consequently fail to connect to other secure dds implementation (that happen to properly provisioned with the sufficient partition permission).

I tried patching the `WriterProxyData` `ReaderProxyData` classes to bubble up the necessary partition name context, thus allow for `is_partition_in_criterias` checks (presently absent) to be evokable in the `check_remote_datawriter` and `check_remote_datareader` callbacks, however I have yet to have time to comb through layers of generic types and call sites to find where such a context (the partition name connecting the remote participant) could be passed along.

As with [#441](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS/issues/441) , this was uncovered during my development of a formal verification framework for the default DDS Security Access Control plugins and procedurally generated permission files.
