## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)
* [Ubuntu 12.04](/security/notices?release=precise)

## Packages

* [python-apt](/security/cves?package=python-apt) - Python interface to libapt-pkg

## Details

USN-4247-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in python-apt. This update

provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 12.04 ESM and Ubuntu 14.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

It was discovered that python-apt would still use MD5 hashes to validate

certain downloaded packages. If a remote attacker were able to perform a

machine-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install

altered packages. ([CVE-2019-15795](/security/CVE-2019-15795))

It was discovered that python-apt could install packages from untrusted

repositories, contrary to expectations. ([CVE-2019-15796](/security/CVE-2019-15796))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 14.04

  -
  [0.9.3.5ubuntu3+esm2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt/0.9.3.5ubuntu3%2Besm2)
* [python3-apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt)
  -
  [0.9.3.5ubuntu3+esm2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt/0.9.3.5ubuntu3%2Besm2)

##### Ubuntu 12.04

* [python-apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt)
  -
  [0.8.3ubuntu7.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt/0.8.3ubuntu7.5)

  -
  [0.8.3ubuntu7.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/python-apt/0.8.3ubuntu7.5)
