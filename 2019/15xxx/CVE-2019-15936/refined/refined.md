The provided content is a security advisory from Bishop Fox detailing multiple vulnerabilities in Solismed version 3.3SP1, including CVE-2019-15936.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- **CVE-2019-15936:** The root cause is an insecure file upload vulnerability in the `/gui/file_upload.php` endpoint. This endpoint does not require authentication or authorization and relies on client-side controls to restrict file types, which can be easily bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CVE-2019-15936:** Insecure File Upload: Allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary files, including PHP files, to the application's web root.
- **CVE-2019-16246:** Local File Inclusion (LFI): Vulnerability in the `/gui/file_viewer.php` endpoint allows for the inclusion of arbitrary files from the server, leading to potential code execution and sensitive file disclosure.
- **CVE-2019-15933:** SQL Injection: Four instances of SQL injection in various endpoints, including `/schedule/loaders/check_datetime.php`, allowing for unauthorized access to and modification of the database, which contains sensitive medical records, social security numbers, user data, and PII.
- **CVE-2019-15935:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Multiple stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities that can be exploited to obtain sensitive information, such as Social Security numbers and user credentials. The XSS can be chained with other vulnerabilities for further exploitation.
- **CVE-2019-15934:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): Systemic CSRF vulnerabilities that allow an unauthenticated attacker to make state-changing requests on behalf of authenticated users, such as creating backdoored users, changing passwords, and other arbitrary actions.
- **CVE-2019-15932:** Incorrect Access Controls: Systemic lack of authentication and authorization in multiple endpoints, leading to exposure of sensitive data and functionalities. Privilege escalation is possible for low-privilege users.
- **CVE-2019-15931:** Directory Traversal: Allows for file uploads to arbitrary locations within the web root using the `target_folder` parameter, increasing the exploitability of insecure file upload vulnerabilities.
- **CVE-2019-17428:** Insecure Cryptographic Storage: Improper AES encryption is used, with a hard-coded key, allowing for the decryption of all encrypted data in the SQL database.
- **CVE-2019-15930:** User Interface Redress (Clickjacking): Lack of framing protection, allowing the application to be framed within a phishing page, which can be used to hijack user clicks and execute arbitrary actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **CVE-2019-15936:** Remote code execution (RCE) on the server.
- **CVE-2019-16246:** Remote code execution and disclosure of arbitrary files from the underlying server.
- **CVE-2019-15933:** Full exposure and potential modification of the entire application database, including highly sensitive patient and user data.
- **CVE-2019-15935:** Exfiltration of sensitive data (including Social Security numbers) and potential compromise of user accounts via credential theft.
- **CVE-2019-15934:** Complete compromise of the application, unauthorized actions performed by authenticated users, and remote code execution via chained exploits.
- **CVE-2019-15932:** Exposure of sensitive data and privilege escalation to administrator level.
- **CVE-2019-15931:** Arbitrary file write to the application's web root, leading to RCE when combined with the insecure file upload.
- **CVE-2019-17428:** Full disclosure of all encrypted data from the database, and arbitrary actions forced on behalf of users.
- **CVE-2019-15930:** Arbitrary actions can be forced on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **CVE-2019-15936:** Sending a crafted `POST` request directly to the `/gui/file_upload.php` endpoint, bypassing client-side checks, and uploading a malicious PHP file.
- **CVE-2019-16246:** Crafting a `GET` request to `/gui/file_viewer.php` with a malicious `uploaded_filename` parameter to include local files.
- **CVE-2019-15933:** Sending crafted `POST` requests to vulnerable endpoints, injecting SQL commands.
- **CVE-2019-15935:** Exploiting stored XSS by inputting malicious scripts in user profile fields or patient records. Reflected XSS via crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript in parameters, luring users into clicking them.
- **CVE-2019-15934:** Crafting a malicious webpage to force authenticated users to send arbitrary `POST` requests to the vulnerable application by embedding it as an iframe and then leveraging clickjacking
- **CVE-2019-15932:** Directly accessing multiple application endpoints without authentication, sending a direct request to the role update endpoint to escalate privileges.
- **CVE-2019-15931:** Sending a malicious `POST` request to the `/gui/file_upload.php` endpoint with a manipulated `target_folder` parameter.
- **CVE-2019-17428:** Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data from the SQL database, and then decrypt the AES encrypted data with the application.
- **CVE-2019-15930:** Framing the Solismed application in a malicious webpage, tricking users into clicking elements on the page, initiating actions in the Solismed application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **CVE-2019-15936:** No authentication required, attacker needs network access to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **CVE-2019-16246:** No authentication required, attacker needs network access to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **CVE-2019-15933:** No authentication required, attacker needs network access to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **CVE-2019-15935:** For stored XSS, a low privilege user account is required and for reflected XSS, no authentication is required, an attacker needs to entice the user to click a malicious link.
- **CVE-2019-15934:** No direct access to the application is required. Requires a way to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious page with the CSRF payload.
- **CVE-2019-15932:** For data exposure, no authentication is required, attacker needs network access to the application endpoints. For privilege escalation, any authenticated user can perform the escalation.
- **CVE-2019-15931:** No authentication is required, attacker needs access to the vulnerable application.
- **CVE-2019-17428:** Requires successful exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities or other methods to obtain the encrypted data from the SQL database, then a local instance of the application to decrypt the data.
- **CVE-2019-15930:** Requires ability to host a malicious page and lure a user to visit that page.

The advisory also includes detailed exploit code and timelines for discovery and vendor communication. It's worth noting that the vendor has released a patched version (3.5), but Bishop Fox has not independently verified the fixes.
