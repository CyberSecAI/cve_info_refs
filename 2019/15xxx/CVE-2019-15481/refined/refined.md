    *   Session hijacking/cookie stealing.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Unauthorized actions within the application on behalf of the victim user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the "timesheet description" field. An attacker would need to insert malicious JavaScript code into the description.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have the ability to create or modify timesheet entries, meaning they would need to be an authenticated user with appropriate permissions to interact with timesheets.

**Additional Information:**

* The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1 of Kimai.
