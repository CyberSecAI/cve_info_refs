# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### @Licenser **[Licenser](/Licenser)** commented [Jun 24, 2019](#issue-459820456)

This reverts commit [0ff4ece](https://github.com/simd-lite/simd-json/commit/0ff4ecec0aaf822f650e704e4ed67c2b6a01a6c6).

This fixes a seg-fault that was introduced with 0.1.14. The reason for that segfault is that it introduced an issue of us reading after the input data od possibly crossing page boundaries.

Better handling of relocated data might solve that but rust could get into the way here. Worth an investigation later.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Description

The affected version of this crate did not guard against accessing memory
beyond the range of its input data. A pointer cast to read the data into
a 256-bit register could lead to a segmentation fault when the end plus
the 32 bytes (256 bit) read would overlap into the next page during string
parsing.

```
page   |  ...  page 1  ...  | ... page 2  ... |
data   | x[n * 32 byte]xx__ |                 |
access | ..][ 32 byte ]     |                 |
segflt |               [ 32 | byte ]          |

```

This allows an attacker to eventually crash a service.

The flaw was corrected by using a padding buffer for the last read from the
input. So that we are we never read over the boundary of the input data.
