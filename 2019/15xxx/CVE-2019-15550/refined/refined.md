Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-15550:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `simd-json` crate during string parsing. The code attempts to read data into a 256-bit register using a pointer cast. However, it fails to properly check if the read would go beyond the bounds of the input buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:**  The core weakness is that the code doesn't validate the bounds of the input data before performing a 256-bit read using SIMD instructions. This can lead to reading memory past the end of the allocated buffer.
*   **Potential page boundary crossing:** The 256-bit read (32 bytes) can potentially cross a memory page boundary if the input data ends near the boundary.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Segmentation Fault:**  The primary impact is a segmentation fault, which leads to a crash of the application/service using the vulnerable library.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this flaw to crash a service, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability can be triggered remotely via network access (e.g., processing a crafted JSON payload).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special privileges:** The attacker does not require any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No user interaction:**  No user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to provide input data:** The attacker needs the ability to send input data (likely a JSON string) that would trigger the out-of-bounds read.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability occurs when processing strings in the `simd-json` library.
*   A pointer is cast to read data into a 256-bit register.
*   The code does not check if this read would exceed the bounds of the input data buffer.
*   The issue is particularly related to SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations.
*   The fix implemented is a padding buffer for the last read from the input data.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Versions `>= 0.1.13` and `< 0.1.15` of the `simd-json` crate are vulnerable.

**Patched Versions:**
* Version `0.1.15` and later contain the fix.

**CWE:**
*   CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read

**Additional Notes:**
*   The fix was implemented in commit `32fcd77` and associated pull request #27
* The vulnerability is specific to x86 and x86_64 architectures.
