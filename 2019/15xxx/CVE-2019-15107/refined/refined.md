Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-15107:

**Root Cause:**

*   A backdoor was maliciously inserted into the `password_change.cgi` script within the Webmin build process. This happened on two separate occasions, once in April 2018 (affecting version 1.890) and again in July 2018 (affecting versions 1.900 to 1.920).
*   The vulnerability lies in how the `password_change.cgi` script processes the "old" password parameter. Specifically, the script uses the `qx` operator, which allows execution of arbitrary shell commands using the content of the "old" parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `password_change.cgi` script. By injecting shell commands into the `old` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication in Webmin 1.890, and in later versions if the "user password change" feature is enabled. This is because the script attempts to validate the old password, and in doing so executes the malicious payload.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected server with root privileges. This enables full control of the target system, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, denial of service, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `password_change.cgi` script. The malicious shell commands are embedded within the "old" parameter of the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Webmin server (typically port 10000).
*   **No Authentication (for 1.890) / Password Change Enabled:**  For Webmin 1.890, no authentication is required. For versions 1.900 to 1.920, the "user password change" feature must be enabled on the Webmin server for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced through a compromised build server. The attacker manipulated the build process, modifying the `password_change.cgi` script to introduce the backdoor.
*   Webmin versions 1.882 through 1.921 were affected, with version 1.890 being vulnerable by default. Later versions require the "expired password changing" feature to be enabled.
*   The backdoor was present in the official SourceForge downloads but not on GitHub.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and publicly disclosed in August 2019.
*   A Metasploit module was developed for this vulnerability, facilitating easy exploitation for penetration testers and attackers.
*   The vulnerability has been actively exploited in the wild by various threat actors, including Mirai botnet variants.
*   Webmin version 1.930 contains a patch for this vulnerability.

The provided content offers much more detail than the basic CVE description, including:

*   Technical details on how the exploit works with a detailed analysis of the vulnerable code.
*   Explanation of how the vulnerable configuration (password change) is enabled.
*   Proof of concept exploit code and Metasploit module.
*   Information about the supply chain attack that introduced the vulnerability.
*   Confirmation that only the SourceForge downloads were backdoored.
*   Additional information from the vendor acknowledging the issue and actions taken to prevent similar attacks in the future.

This information can be used to effectively identify and remediate this vulnerability in vulnerable Webmin installations.
