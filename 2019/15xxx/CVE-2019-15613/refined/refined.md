Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-15613, CVE-2019-15621, CVE-2019-15623, and CVE-2019-15624:

**CVE-2019-15613**

*   **Root Cause:**  A flaw in Nextcloud Server where workflow rules incorrectly depend on file extensions instead of proper MIME type checks.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of file MIME types in workflow rules.
*   **Impact:** Allows for potential circumvention of workflow rules by manipulating file extensions. The CVSS v3 score indicates high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  A low-privileged authenticated user can upload files with manipulated extensions to bypass workflow rules. User interaction is required as the user has to upload a file.

**CVE-2019-15621**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper permission preservation when sharing mount points.
*   **Weakness:** Share recipients can reshare the mount point of a share they received with write permissions as public links.
*  **Impact:** A share recipient could elevate their permissions by creating a public share with write permissions, potentially allowing unauthorized modifications of the shared content.  CVSS v3 indicates a high integrity impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  A low-privileged authenticated user who received a share needs to reshare the mount point. No user interaction is required by the user who did the initial sharing.

**CVE-2019-15623**

*   **Root Cause:** Exposure of private information when the Nextcloud Lookup Server is disabled.
*   **Weakness:** The server sends its domain and user IDs to the Nextcloud Lookup Server even when the lookup server is disabled, without any further data
*   **Impact:** The server's domain and user IDs are exposed to a server when they shouldn't be. The CVSS v3 score indicates a low confidentiality impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** No privileges are required, as this exposure happens when the lookup server is disabled. No user interaction is required.

**CVE-2019-15624**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation when creating new users.
*   **Weakness:** Group admins can create users with IDs that match system folders.
*   **Impact:** Could potentially lead to conflicts or unauthorized access through the created users. The CVSS v3 score indicates a high integrity impact.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  A high-privileged authenticated user (group admin) is required to create new users with specific IDs. No user interaction is required.

**Summary of Affected Products (from SUSE advisories):**

*   SUSE Package Hub for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12
*   SUSE Package Hub 15 SP1
*   SUSE Package Hub 15
*   openSUSE Leap 15.1
