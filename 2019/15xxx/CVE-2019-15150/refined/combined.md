# MediaWiki OAuth2 Client

MediaWiki implementation of the PHP League's [OAuth2 Client](https://github.com/thephpleague/oauth2-client), to allow MediaWiki to act as a client to any OAuth2 server. Currently maintained by [Schine GmbH](https://www.star-made.org/).

Requires MediaWiki 1.25+.

## Installation

Clone this repo into the extension directory. In the cloned directory, run 'git submodule update --init' to initialize the local configuration file and fetch all data from the OAuth2 client library.

Finally, run [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) in /vendors/oauth2-client to install the library dependency.

```
composer install

```

## Usage

Add the following line to your LocalSettings.php file.

```
wfLoadExtension( 'MW-OAuth2Client' );

```

Required settings to be added to LocalSettings.php

```
$wgOAuth2Client['client']['id']     = ''; // The client ID assigned to you by the provider
$wgOAuth2Client['client']['secret'] = ''; // The client secret assigned to you by the provider

$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['authorize_endpoint']     = ''; // Authorization URL
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['access_token_endpoint']  = ''; // Token URL
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['api_endpoint']           = ''; // URL to fetch user JSON
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['redirect_uri']           = ''; // URL for OAuth2 server to redirect to

$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['username'] = 'username'; // JSON path to username
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['email'] = 'email'; // JSON path to email

```

The JSON path should be set to point to the appropriate attributes in the JSON.

If the properties you want from your JSON object are nested, you can use periods.

For example, if user JSON is

```
{
    "user": {
        "username": "my username",
        "email": "my email"
    }
}

```

Then your JSON path configuration should be these

```
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['username'] = 'user.username'; // JSON path to username
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['email'] = 'user.email'; // JSON path to email

```

You can see [Json Helper Test case](/Schine/MW-OAuth2Client/blob/master/tests/phpunit/JsonHelperTest.php) for more.

The **Redirect URI** for your wiki should be:

```
http://your.wiki.domain/path/to/wiki/Special:OAuth2Client/callback

```

Optional further configuration

```
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['http_bearer_token'] = 'Bearer'; // Token to use in HTTP Authentication
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['query_parameter_token'] = 'auth_token'; // query parameter to use
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['scopes'] = 'read_citizen_info'; //Permissions

$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['service_name'] = 'Citizen Registry'; // the name of your service
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['service_login_link_text'] = 'Login with StarMade'; // the text of the login link

```

Optional Authorization Callback

Provide a callback and error message in the configuration that evaluates a conditional based upon the result of some business logic provided by the authorization endpoint response.

```
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['authz_callback'] = function($response) {
  if ($response['property']) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}; // return true or false based on something from the authorization response
$wgOAuth2Client['configuration']['authz_failure_message'] // text of error message

```

### Popup Window

To use a popup window to login to the external OAuth2 server, copy the JS from modal.js to the [MediaWiki:Common.js](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual%3AInterface/JavaScript) page on your wiki.

[CVE-2019-15150] CSRF in MediaWiki extension OAuth2 Client 0.3

Happy Sunday everyone.

A security bulletin for you all.

Software:
--------
MediaWiki OAuth2 Client (<https://github.com/Schine/MW-OAuth2Client>)

Description:
----------
MediaWiki implementation of the PHP League's OAuth2 Client, to allow MediaWiki
to act as a client to any OAuth2 server.

Not Affeted:
------------
0.2 and earlier.

Affected Versions:
---------------
0.3

Fixed Versions:
-------------
0.4

Problem:
--------

In the OAuth2 Client extension 0.3 for MediaWiki, a CSRF vulnerability
exists due to the OAuth2 state parameter not being checked in the callback
function.

Per OAuth 2.0 spec, the authorization code grant flow is susceptible to CSRF
and clickjacking attacks unless an appropriate "state" parameter is chosen and
verified.[1][2][3]

Although the software correctly generates an unguessable state value and sets
it in the URL to the OAuth 2.0 server, it fails to actually check/validate the
parameter in the callback against what it previously selected.

The regression was introduced when switching underlying vendor code.[4]

Impact:
-------

As described in the OAuth 2.0 RFC spec, this opens the site relying on the
software up to clickjacking and CSRF attacks.[1]

A successful attack can lead to loss of integrity of the user/victim.

Solution:
---------

Update callback function to verify presence and correct `state` value as
previously chosen prior to initiating the OAuth2 flow[5], as done in v0.4
release.[6]

Timeline:
---------

2019-08-17: Bug discovered
2019-08-17: CVE requested, assigned, privately disclosed to maintainer,
            bugfix/patch authored
2019-08-18: Maintainer acknowledged, patched version 0.4 is released

Credit:
-------
Discovery by me.

Thanks to the maintainer Schine GmbH. for a quick acknowledgement and release.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# [CVE-2019-15150] CSRF in MediaWiki extension OAuth2 Client 0.3

[CVE-2019-15150] CSRF in MediaWiki extension OAuth2 Client 0.3

Happy Sunday everyone.

A security bulletin for you all.

Software:
--------
MediaWiki OAuth2 Client (<https://github.com/Schine/MW-OAuth2Client>)

Description:
----------
MediaWiki implementation of the PHP League's OAuth2 Client, to allow MediaWiki
to act as a client to any OAuth2 server.

Not Affeted:
------------
0.2 and earlier.

Affected Versions:
---------------
0.3

Fixed Versions:
-------------
0.4

Problem:
--------

In the OAuth2 Client extension 0.3 for MediaWiki, a CSRF vulnerability
exists due to the OAuth2 state parameter not being checked in the callback
function.

Per OAuth 2.0 spec, the authorization code grant flow is susceptible to CSRF
and clickjacking attacks unless an appropriate "state" parameter is chosen and
verified.[1][2][3]

Although the software correctly generates an unguessable state value and sets
it in the URL to the OAuth 2.0 server, it fails to actually check/validate the
parameter in the callback against what it previously selected.

The regression was introduced when switching underlying vendor code.[4]

Impact:
-------

As described in the OAuth 2.0 RFC spec, this opens the site relying on the
software up to clickjacking and CSRF attacks.[1]

A successful attack can lead to loss of integrity of the user/victim.

Solution:
---------

Update callback function to verify presence and correct `state` value as
previously chosen prior to initiating the OAuth2 flow[5], as done in v0.4
release.[6]

Timeline:
---------

2019-08-17: Bug discovered
2019-08-17: CVE requested, assigned, privately disclosed to maintainer,
            bugfix/patch authored
2019-08-18: Maintainer acknowledged, patched version 0.4 is released

Credit:
-------
Discovery by me.

Thanks to the maintainer Schine GmbH. for a quick acknowledgement and release.

Enforce/verify state parameter of callback. Please update as soon as possible.

"The extension fails to check/validate the state parameter on the callback. This opens up the extension to an authentication bypass using a clickjacking technique. In effect a CSRF vulnerability (<https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/352.html>) is present." - [@f3ndot](https://github.com/f3ndot)

Subject: [CVE-2019-15150] CSRF in MediaWiki extension OAuth2 Client 0.3

[CVE-2019-15150] CSRF in MediaWiki extension OAuth2 Client 0.3

Happy Sunday everyone.

A security bulletin for you all.

Software:
--------
MediaWiki OAuth2 Client (<https://github.com/Schine/MW-OAuth2Client>)

Description:
----------
MediaWiki implementation of the PHP League's OAuth2 Client, to allow MediaWiki
to act as a client to any OAuth2 server.

Not Affeted:
------------
0.2 and earlier.

Affected Versions:
---------------
0.3

Fixed Versions:
-------------
0.4

Problem:
--------

In the OAuth2 Client extension 0.3 for MediaWiki, a CSRF vulnerability
exists due to the OAuth2 state parameter not being checked in the callback
function.

Per OAuth 2.0 spec, the authorization code grant flow is susceptible to CSRF
and clickjacking attacks unless an appropriate "state" parameter is chosen and
verified.[1][2][3]

Although the software correctly generates an unguessable state value and sets
it in the URL to the OAuth 2.0 server, it fails to actually check/validate the
parameter in the callback against what it previously selected.

The regression was introduced when switching underlying vendor code.[4]

Impact:
-------

As described in the OAuth 2.0 RFC spec, this opens the site relying on the
software up to clickjacking and CSRF attacks.[1]

A successful attack can lead to loss of integrity of the user/victim.

Solution:
---------

Update callback function to verify presence and correct `state` value as
previously chosen prior to initiating the OAuth2 flow[5], as done in v0.4
release.[6]

Timeline:
---------

2019-08-17: Bug discovered
2019-08-17: CVE requested, assigned, privately disclosed to maintainer,
            bugfix/patch authored
2019-08-18: Maintainer acknowledged, patched version 0.4 is released

Credit:
-------
Discovery by me.

Thanks to the maintainer Schine GmbH. for a quick acknowledgement and release.
