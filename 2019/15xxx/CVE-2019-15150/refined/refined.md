{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The OAuth2 Client extension for MediaWiki failed to validate the 'state' parameter in the callback function during the OAuth2 authorization code grant flow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability due to missing 'state' parameter validation in the OAuth2 callback.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A successful attack can lead to a loss of integrity of the user/victim by potentially allowing an attacker to bypass authentication using clickjacking techniques.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could craft a malicious link or page that redirects a victim to the OAuth2 provider. Upon successful authentication at the provider, the victim is redirected back to the vulnerable MediaWiki instance with a manipulated response that lacks state validation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into interacting with a malicious link or web page that initiates the OAuth2 flow towards the OAuth provider. No special access to the MediaWiki instance itself is needed."
