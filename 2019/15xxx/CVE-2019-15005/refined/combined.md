# usd-2019-0016 | Bitbucket v5.10.1 – Broken Access Control 2

**Advisory ID**: usd-2019-0016
**CVE Number**: CVE-2019-15005
**Affected Product**: Bitbucket
**Affected Version**: < v6.6
**Vulnerability Type**: Broken Access Control
**Security Risk**: High
**Vendor URL**: <https://www.atlassian.com/>
**Vendor Status**: Fixed

###

### Description

Access control, sometimes called authorization, is how a web application grants access to content and functions to some users and not others.
These checks are performed after authentication, and govern what ‘authorized’ users are allowed to do. Access control sounds like a simple problem but is insidiously difficult to implement correctly.
A web application’s access control model is closely tied to the content and functions that the site provides. In addition, the users may fall into a number of groups or roles with different abilities or privileges.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

Inside the endpoint „/rest/troubleshooting/latest/hercules/periodicScanner/settings“ an administrator can create a job for scanning logfiles periodicaly.
Unpriviliged users don’t have access to the GUI which configures such jobs. But unprivileged users can successfully send a request to create a scanning job.
In particular they can state an email address, to which the results will be send.

Request (send from an normal user):

### About usd Security Advisories

![](https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/07/icon-hero.png "icon-hero")

In order to protect businesses against hackers and criminals, we always have to keep our skills and knowledge up to date. Thus, security research is just as important for our work as is building up a security community to promote the exchange of knowledge. After all, more security can only be achieved if many individuals take on the task.

Our [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/en/cst-academy/) and our [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) are essential parts of our security mission. We share the knowledge we gain in our practical work and our research through training courses and publications. In this context, the [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) publishes a series of papers on new vulnerabilities and current security issues.

Always for the sake of our mission: „more security.“

### Description

The Atlassian Troubleshooting and Support Tools (ATST) plugin prior to version 1.17.2 which was used in Bamboo before version 6.10.2, allows an unprivileged user to initiate periodic log scans and send the results to a user-specified email address due to a missing authorization check. The email message may contain configuration information about the application that the plugin is installed into.

# usd-2019-0016 | Bitbucket v5.10.1 – Broken Access Control 2

**Advisory ID**: usd-2019-0016
**CVE Number**: CVE-2019-15005
**Affected Product**: Bitbucket
**Affected Version**: < v6.6
**Vulnerability Type**: Broken Access Control
**Security Risk**: High
**Vendor URL**: <https://www.atlassian.com/>
**Vendor Status**: Fixed

###

### Description

Access control, sometimes called authorization, is how a web application grants access to content and functions to some users and not others.
These checks are performed after authentication, and govern what ‘authorized’ users are allowed to do. Access control sounds like a simple problem but is insidiously difficult to implement correctly.
A web application’s access control model is closely tied to the content and functions that the site provides. In addition, the users may fall into a number of groups or roles with different abilities or privileges.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)

Inside the endpoint „/rest/troubleshooting/latest/hercules/periodicScanner/settings“ an administrator can create a job for scanning logfiles periodicaly.
Unpriviliged users don’t have access to the GUI which configures such jobs. But unprivileged users can successfully send a request to create a scanning job.
In particular they can state an email address, to which the results will be send.

Request (send from an normal user):

After all, more security can only be achieved if many individuals take on the task.

Our [CST Academy](https://www.usd.de/en/cst-academy/) and our [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) are essential parts of our security mission. We share the knowledge we gain in our practical work and our research through training courses and publications. In this context, the [usd HeroLab](https://herolab.usd.de/en/) publishes a series of papers on new vulnerabilities and current security issues.

Always for the sake of our mission: „more security.“
