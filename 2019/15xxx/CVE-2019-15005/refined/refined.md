Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15005:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the Atlassian Troubleshooting and Support Tools (ATST) plugin, specifically in the `/rest/troubleshooting/latest/hercules/periodicScanner/settings` endpoint. This allowed unprivileged users to access functionality intended for administrators.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is that the application did not properly restrict access to the periodic log scanning functionality, allowing unauthorized users to trigger it.
- **Improper Authorization:** Unprivileged users could send requests to create a log scanning job, which they should not have been able to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could configure the log scan to send results to an email address of their choosing, potentially gaining access to sensitive configuration information of the application contained in the logs.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** While not directly stated, the disclosed information could be used as a stepping stone for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to the `/rest/troubleshooting/latest/hercules/periodicScanner/settings` endpoint.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The server-side application fails to verify if the user is authorized to access the specified functionality when the request is made.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application but does not need administrator privileges.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in Bitbucket and also affects Bamboo due to the shared ATST plugin.
*   The fix was released in Bitbucket version 6.6.0 and Bamboo version 6.10.2.
*   The specific issue was within the ATST plugin before version 1.17.2
