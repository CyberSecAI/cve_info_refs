NOTE: This was fuzzed only to collect corpous which can be used while fuzzing the latest version of xpdf.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It looks that related to this there was assigned [CVE-2019-15860](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-36ff-j8p5-6r9r "CVE-2019-15860"). But this was fuzzed again a very ancient version. Is there information with which version this issue was fixed?

Sorry, something went wrong.

Sorry, something went wrong.

It is not clear what the issue is here, but likely that num\*sizeof/(XPDref) overflows?

I think this is in this 2004 advisory listed:

<https://security.appspot.com/security/CESA-2004-007.txt>

Sorry, something went wrong.

this would make it [CVE-2004-0888](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x479-x3mc-r9mr "CVE-2004-0888") I think ;)

Sorry, something went wrong.
