# OSS-Fuzz

[Fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing) is a well-known technique for uncovering programming errors in software. Many of these detectable errors, like [buffer overflow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow), can have serious security implications. Google has found [thousands](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list?q=label%3AStability-LibFuzzer%2CStability-AFL%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1) of security vulnerabilities and stability bugs by deploying [guided in-process fuzzing of Chrome components](https://security.googleblog.com/2016/08/guided-in-process-fuzzing-of-chrome.html), and we now want to share that service with the open source community.

In cooperation with the [Core Infrastructure Initiative](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/) and the [OpenSSF](https://www.openssf.org/), OSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by combining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable, distributed execution. Projects that do not qualify for OSS-Fuzz (e.g. closed source) can run their own instances of [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz) or [ClusterFuzzLite](https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/).

We support the [libFuzzer](https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html), [AFL++](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus), [Honggfuzz](https://github.com/google/honggfuzz), and [Centipede](https://github.com/google/centipede) fuzzing engines in combination with [Sanitizers](https://github.com/google/sanitizers), as well as [ClusterFuzz](https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz), a distributed fuzzer execution environment and reporting tool.

Currently, OSS-Fuzz supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python and Java/JVM code. Other languages supported by [LLVM](https://llvm.org) may work too. OSS-Fuzz supports fuzzing x86\_64 and i386 builds.

## Project history

OSS-Fuzz was launched in 2016 in response to the [Heartbleed](https://heartbleed.com/) vulnerability, discovered in [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/), one of the most popular open source projects for encrypting web traffic. The vulnerability had the potential to affect almost every internet user, yet was caused by a relatively simple memory buffer overflow bug that could have been detected by fuzzing—that is, by running the code on randomized inputs to intentionally cause unexpected behaviors or crashes. At the time, though, fuzzing was not widely used and was cumbersome for developers, requiring extensive manual effort.

Google created OSS-Fuzz to fill this gap: it’s a free service that runs fuzzers for open source projects and privately alerts developers to the bugs detected. Since its launch, OSS-Fuzz has become a critical service for the open source community, growing beyond C/C++ to detect problems in memory-safe languages such as Go, Rust, and Python.

## Learn more about fuzzing

This documentation describes how to use OSS-Fuzz service for your open source project. To learn more about fuzzing in general, we recommend reading [libFuzzer tutorial](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/blob/master/tutorial/libFuzzerTutorial.md) and the other docs in [google/fuzzing](https://github.com/google/fuzzing/tree/master/docs) repository. These and some other resources are listed on the [useful links](/oss-fuzz/reference/useful-links/#tutorials) page.

## Trophies

As of August 2023, OSS-Fuzz has helped identify and fix over [10,000](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug-Security%20label%3Aclusterfuzz%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1) vulnerabilities and [36,000](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=Type%3DBug%20label%3Aclusterfuzz%20-status%3ADuplicate%2CWontFix&can=1) bugs across [1,000](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects) projects.

Subject: OpenSC 0.20.0 released

Hi all!

I'm happy to finally announce the new release 0.20.0 of OpenSC. You can
read a full summary of the changes and get the release binaries on GitHub
<<https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/releases/tag/0.20.0>>.

We've extended our continuous testing by fuzzing the code with OSS-Fuzz
<<https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz>>. It is running billions of tests each
weak and has found around 100 unique crashes, most notable the security
issues tracked as CVE-2019-6502, CVE-2019-15946, CVE-2019-15945,
CVE-2019-19480, CVE-2019-19481 and CVE-2019-19479. Getting our hands on all
the problems reported by the fuzzing was very challenging. Special thanks
to Jakub Jelen, who spend many hours on analyzing and fixing many of the
issues.

Regards,
Frank Morgner.

Debian Bug     : 909444 939668 939669

Several security vulnerabilities were fixed in opensc, a set of
libraries and utilities to access smart cards that support
cryptographic operations.

Out-of-bounds reads, buffer overflows and double frees could be used
by attackers able to supply crafted smart cards to cause a denial of
service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
0.16.0-3+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your opensc packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

Name : opensc
Product : Fedora 31
Version : 0.20.0
Release : 3.fc31
URL : <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/wiki>
Summary : Smart card library and applications
Description :
OpenSC provides a set of libraries and utilities to work with smart cards. Its
main focus is on cards that support cryptographic operations, and facilitate
their use in security applications such as authentication, mail encryption and
digital signatures. OpenSC implements the PKCS#11 API so applications
supporting this API (such as Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird) can use it. On
the card OpenSC implements the PKCS#15 standard and aims to be compatible with
every software/card that does so, too.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
