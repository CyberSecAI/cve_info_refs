  "CVE-2019-15946": {
    "root_cause": "Out-of-bounds access of an ASN.1 Octet string.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Supply crafted smart cards"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to supply crafted smart cards.",
     "details":"The vulnerability lies within the `asn1_decode_entry` function in `libopensc/asn1.c` . Specifically, a missing check before a pointer increment operation can lead to an out-of-bounds access when handling ASN.1 Octet strings. The fix involves adding a check to ensure that the length of the string is greater than 1 before the pointer increment is performed. The commit  `a3fc7693f3a035a8a7921cffb98432944bb42740` addresses this vulnerability."
