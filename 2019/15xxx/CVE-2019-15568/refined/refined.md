Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of sanitization of the `tax_levels` parameter in the taxon search functionality, which could lead to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The code was vulnerable to SQL injection due to unsanitized input in the `tax_levels` parameter used in database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful SQL injection attack could allow an attacker to potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database, depending on the database permissions and the injection point.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `tax_levels` parameter during a taxon search. By crafting malicious input in this parameter, an attacker could inject SQL code into the query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to interact with the taxon search functionality and manipulate the `tax_levels` parameter. This likely means being a user able to perform searches. No special access or privileges are explicitly required beyond being a user of the platform.

**Additional Notes**

* The provided content is from a pull request that addresses the SQL injection vulnerability. The commit message "Sanitize tax_levels to avoid SQL injection." clearly indicates that this was the purpose of the change.
* The pull request also mentions that the change was to allow search on any part of the word (not just prefix search) and sanitize `tax_levels`
* While the primary focus of the pull request is on the "search any part of the word" functionality, the commit messages and discussion clearly show that addressing a SQL injection vulnerability was a crucial part of this update.
