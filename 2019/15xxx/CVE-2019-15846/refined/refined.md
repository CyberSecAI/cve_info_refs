Based on the provided documents, here's the vulnerability information regarding CVE-2019-15846:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `string_interpret_escape()` function in Exim. This function is used to handle escaped characters in strings. The issue arises when a backslash character is the last character of the input string. In this scenario, the function incorrectly interprets the string-terminating null byte as a character to be escaped, leading to an out-of-bounds read and potential write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `string_interpret_escape()` function increments the string pointer beyond the allocated buffer when processing a trailing backslash.
- **Potential out-of-bounds write:** This out-of-bounds pointer can be used to cause a heap overflow, leading to an arbitrary write to memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote code execution:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the affected server.
- **Denial of service:** The vulnerability can also be used to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the Exim process.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Server Name Indication (SNI):**  By sending a crafted SNI string ending in a backslash-null sequence during the initial TLS handshake.
- **Peer Distinguished Name (DN):** By sending a crafted TLS client certificate with a malicious DN

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** An attacker must be able to connect to the vulnerable Exim server over the network.
- **Unauthenticated:** Exploitation can be performed by an unauthenticated remote attacker.
- **TLS enabled server**: The server must accept TLS connections, either by STARTTLS or direct TLS.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in all Exim versions up to and including 4.92.1.
- The issue is present regardless of the TLS library used (both GnuTLS and OpenSSL are affected).
- A proof-of-concept (POC) exploit exists.
- Qualys provided the analysis on how this is exploitable.
- Mitigation of the exploit can be done by using access control lists (ACLs) in exim.
- The fix is included in exim version 4.92.2.
- It is mentioned the fix included is also present in the exim-4.92.2+fixes branch.
