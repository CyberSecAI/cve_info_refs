The provided content discusses an active exploitation of vulnerabilities in multiple WordPress plugins, including "nd-donations", and is therefore related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Several plugins by NicDark (now Endreww), including "nd-donations", had flaws related to AJAX requests. These plugins registered a `nopriv_` AJAX action that was responsible for importing various WordPress settings.
*   The vulnerability in these plugins allowed unauthenticated visitors to send AJAX requests and modify the `siteurl` setting of the victim's site.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Unauthenticated access to AJAX actions intended for modifying WordPress settings (specifically `siteurl`).
*   Lack of proper input validation/sanitization of the data provided through AJAX requests.
*   Insecure implementation of AJAX handlers.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Website redirection:** By modifying the `siteurl`, attackers could redirect all of the victim site's scripts, effectively replacing all of the site's loaded JavaScript with a file under the attacker's control. This would redirect website visitors to potentially malicious locations.
*   **Malicious script injection:** Attackers inject a script under their control by modifying the `siteurl` setting which allows them to run arbitrary code in a victim's browser.
*   **Traffic redirection:** All traffic of the victim site will be redirected to attacker-controlled domains.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Sending unauthenticated AJAX requests to vulnerable plugins.
*   Manipulating the `siteurl` setting via the vulnerable AJAX actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   No authentication needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   Ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*   Network access to reach the vulnerable WordPress website.
