Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15031:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the Linux kernel's Transactional Memory (TM) handling on PowerPC architectures, specifically when dealing with Floating Point (FP) and Vector Multimedia Extension (VMX) registers during interrupts. The kernel incorrectly handles the state of FP/VMX registers within transactions. When a process starts a transaction with FP/VMX disabled, and an interrupt occurs, the kernel enables FP/VMX but doesn't properly update the checkpointed state of these registers. If the transaction then rolls back, the checkpointed state might contain register values from a different process leading to a data leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Incorrect TM Handling During Interrupts:** The core issue is that when a process has transactional memory active (TM=1) and floating point unit (FP) and vector unit (VMX) disabled (FP=0), the hardware state for FP/VMX is unrelated to the process. However, upon returning from an interrupt, the kernel enables FP/VMX (FP=1), while failing to update the checkpointed TM state with the correct process-specific values.
2.  **Misuse of `MSR_TM_ACTIVE`:** The kernel misuses the `MSR_TM_ACTIVE` flag in `arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c`, leading to incorrect assumptions about the FP/VMX state when returning from an interrupt inside a transaction. It incorrectly sets the `FP` flag but does not properly checkpoint the state.
3.  **Data Leak:** This incorrect state management leads to the possibility of leaking FP/VMX register data from one process to another, as the rollback of a transaction may retrieve a checkpointed state that belongs to another process.
4.  **State Corruption:** Processes using Transactional memory and FP/VMX can also experience corruption of their FP/VMX state.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Data Leakage:** A local user can potentially read FP/VMX registers of other users' processes, leading to the leakage of sensitive information.
2.  **State Corruption:** Users of transactional memory and FP/VMX can experience corruption of their FP/VMX state, which can lead to unexpected program behavior or crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local User:** A local user can trigger this vulnerability by running a specially crafted application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to a system running a vulnerable kernel.
*   **User-Level Privileges:** The attacker does not require special privileges, but needs to be able to start a transaction using `tbegin`. The attacker needs to access to a PowerPC system with support for Transactional Memory, including POWER8 and POWER9 VMs, but excluding bare metal POWER9 systems.
*   **Interrupt Trigger:** The attacker needs to trigger an interrupt inside a transaction with FP/VMX disabled. The user would need to retry multiple times to trigger the bug as this requires an interrupt while FP/VMX is off during the transaction

**Additional Technical Details**

*   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `fa7771176b439` ("powerpc: Don't enable FP/Altivec if not checkpointed"), merged in Linux kernel v4.15.
*   The fix was applied via commit `a8318c13e79badb92bc6640704a64cc022a6eb97`.
*   The fix removes `tm_active_with_fp()`, as the transaction state handling was already handled by `restore_tm_state()`.
*   The provided patch is for the following file:  `arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c`
*   The vulnerability is present in all 64-bit machines with transactional memory (TM). POWER8, POWER9 VMs on KVM and LPARs are all affected by this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability was verified by running `tm-poison` from the kernel self-tests.

**OpenSUSE Specific Information:**

*   The openSUSE security advisory `openSUSE-SU-2019:2173-1` includes a fix for CVE-2019-15031.
*   The affected products include openSUSE Leap 15.0.

**SUSE Specific Information:**

*   The SUSE security advisory page for this CVE indicates that the vulnerability is resolved.
*   SUSE assigns a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 to this vulnerability
*   The vulnerability is addressed in multiple SUSE security advisories, including `SUSE-SU-2019:2412-1`, `SUSE-SU-2019:2414-1` and many others
*   The advisory mentions that SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix

**Ubuntu Specific Information:**

*   Ubuntu's security notice `USN-4135-1` includes a fix for this vulnerability.
*   The affected releases are Ubuntu 19.04, 18.04 ESM, and 16.04 ESM.

In summary, this CVE describes a data leak vulnerability in the Linux kernel related to transactional memory on PowerPC systems, arising from incorrect handling of FP/VMX register states during interrupts. It allows a local, unprivileged user to read another user's FP/VMX registers under specific timing conditions.
