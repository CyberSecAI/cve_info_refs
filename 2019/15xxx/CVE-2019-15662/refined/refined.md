```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `KfeCo10X64.sys` driver of Rivet Killer Control Center. The driver fails to validate an offset parameter passed to IOCTL 0x120044 during a memory operation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary read primitive due to the lack of input validation for the offset parameter during memory access.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows for an arbitrary memory read. This can be used as part of a chain to escalate privileges.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted IOCTL call (0x120044) to the vulnerable driver `KfeCo10X64.sys`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability."
