                 CVE-2018-20022 CVE-2019-15678 CVE-2019-15679 CVE-2019-15680
                 CVE-2019-15681
Debian Bug     : 945364

Several vulnerabilities have recently been discovered in TightVNC 1.x, an
X11 based VNC server/viewer application for Windows and Unix.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in rfbserver.c in TightVNC
    server did not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of
    ClientCutText data, which allowed remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message
    that was processed by using a single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2018-7225

    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2019-8287

    TightVNC code contained global buffer overflow in HandleCoRREBBP
    macro function, which could potentially have result in code
    execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

    (aka CVE-2018-20020/libvncserver)

CVE-2018-20021

    TightVNC in vncviewer/rfbproto.c contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop
    vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed an attacker to consume
    an excessive amount of resources like CPU and RAM.

CVE-2018-20022

    TightVNC's vncviewer contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper
    Initialization vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed
    attackers to read stack memory and could be abused for information
    disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could be used to
    leak stack memory layout and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2019-15678

    TightVNC code version contained heap buffer overflow in
    rfbServerCutText handler, which could have potentially resulted in
    code execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

    (partially aka CVE-2018-20748/libvnvserver)

CVE-2019-15679

    TightVNC's vncviewer code contained a heap buffer overflow in
    InitialiseRFBConnection function, which could have potentially
    resulted in code execution. This attack appeared to be exploitable
    via network connectivity.

    (partially aka CVE-2018-20748/libvnvserver)

CVE-2019-15680

    TightVNC's vncviewer code contained a null pointer dereference in
    HandleZlibBPP function, which could have resulted in Denial of System
    (DoS). This attack appeared to be exploitable via network
    connectivity.

CVE-2019-15681

    TightVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could have been abused
    for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it
    could have been used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This
    attack appeared to be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.9-6.5+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your tightvnc packages.

Package        : vino
Version        : 3.14.0-2+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2014-6053 CVE-2018-7225 CVE-2019-15681
Debian Bug     : 945784

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of vino, a
desktop sharing utility for the GNOME desktop environment.

The vulnerabilities referenced below are issues that have originally been
reported against Debian source package libvncserver. The vino source
package in Debian ships a custom-patched and stripped down variant of
libvncserver, thus some of libvncserver's security fixes required porting
over.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.14.0-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your vino packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

                 CVE-2019-15681

Several vulnerabilities have been identified in the VNC code of iTALC, a
classroom management software. All vulnerabilities referenced below are
issues that have originally been reported against Debian source package
libvncserver. The italc source package in Debian ships a custom-patched
version of libvncserver, thus libvncserver's security fixes required
porting over.

CVE-2014-6051

    Integer overflow in the MallocFrameBuffer function in vncviewer.c in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) and possibly executed arbitrary code via an advertisement for
    a large screen size, which triggered a heap-based buffer overflow.

CVE-2014-6052

    The HandleRFBServerMessage function in libvncclient/rfbproto.c in
    LibVNCServer did not check certain malloc return values, which
    allowed remote VNC servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by specifying a large
    screen size in a (1) FramebufferUpdate, (2) ResizeFrameBuffer, or (3)
    PalmVNCReSizeFrameBuffer message.

CVE-2014-6053

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer did not properly handle
    attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allowed
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or
    daemon crash) via a crafted message that was processed by using a
    single unchecked malloc.

CVE-2014-6054

    The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and server crash) via
    a zero value in the scaling factor in a (1) PalmVNCSetScaleFactor or
    (2) SetScale message.

CVE-2014-6055

    Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the File Transfer feature in
    rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer allowed remote authenticated users to
    cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a (1) long file or (2) directory name or the (3) FileTime
    attribute in a rfbFileTransferOffer message.

CVE-2016-9941

    Heap-based buffer overflow in rfbproto.c in LibVNCClient in
    LibVNCServer allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message containing a subrectangle outside of the
    client drawing area.

CVE-2016-9942

    Heap-based buffer overflow in ultra.c in LibVNCClient in LibVNCServer
    allowed remote servers to cause a denial of service (application
    crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    FramebufferUpdate message with the Ultra type tile, such that the LZO
    payload decompressed length exceeded what is specified by the tile
    dimensions.

CVE-2018-6307

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-7225

    An issue was discovered in LibVNCServer.
    rfbProcessClientNormalMessage() in rfbserver.c did not sanitize
    msg.cct.length, leading to access to uninitialized and potentially
    sensitive data or possibly unspecified other impact (e.g., an integer
    overflow) via specially crafted VNC packets.

CVE-2018-15126

    LibVNC contained heap use-after-free vulnerability in server code of
    file transfer extension that can result remote code execution.

CVE-2018-15127

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability in server code
    of file transfer extension that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20749

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20750

    LibVNC contained a heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in
    libvncserver/rfbserver.c. The fix for CVE-2018-15127 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20019

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bound write vulnerabilities in
    VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20748

    LibVNC contained multiple heap out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in
    libvncclient/rfbproto.c. The fix for CVE-2018-20019 was incomplete.

CVE-2018-20020

    LibVNC contained heap out-of-bound write vulnerability inside
    structure in VNC client code that can result remote code execution

CVE-2018-20021

    LibVNC contained a CWE-835: Infinite loop vulnerability in VNC client
    code. Vulnerability allows attacker to consume excessive amount of
    resources like CPU and RAM

CVE-2018-20022

    LibVNC contained multiple weaknesses CWE-665: Improper Initialization
    vulnerability in VNC client code that allowed attackers to read stack
    memory and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with
    another vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout
    and in bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20023

    LibVNC contained CWE-665: Improper Initialization vulnerability in
    VNC Repeater client code that allowed attacker to read stack memory
    and could be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another
    vulnerability, it could be used to leak stack memory layout and in
    bypassing ASLR.

CVE-2018-20024

    LibVNC contained null pointer dereference in VNC client code that
    could result DoS.

CVE-2019-15681

    LibVNC contained a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which
    allowed an attacker to read stack memory and could be abused for
    information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it could
    be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appeared to
    be exploitable via network connectivity.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
1:2.0.2+dfsg1-2+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your italc packages.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c0)  Wolfgang Frisch   2020-01-08 16:06:52 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-15690  TigerVNC prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow.   There is no useful information on this vulnerability yet. Security researcher Pavel Cheremushkin hinted at its discover on oss-sec [1]:  >Also, I accidently found another heap buffer overflow in LibVNC >(CVE-2019-15690), when I was playing with CodeQL queries. It was missed during >previous analysis by me. It later turned out that my fuzzer didn't find it >either, because it required at least 256MB to be sent over the network to >trigger it :)  [1] <https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2019/q4/170> ``` [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c2)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-04-24 11:28:51 UTC  ``` Upstream issue: <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/issues/381> Fix: <https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/commit/54220248886b5001fbbb9fa73c4e1a2cb9413fed> ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c3)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2020-04-24 11:34:53 UTC  ``` Tracked SLE12,12,15 as affected ``` [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c4)  Petr Gajdos   2020-04-27 09:23:43 UTC  ``` Will submit for TW,15,12,11/LibVNCServer. ``` [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c5)  Petr Gajdos   2020-04-27 09:38:30 UTC  ``` I believe all fixed. ``` [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c6)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-04-27 10:10:06 UTC  ``` This is an autogenerated message for OBS integration: This bug (1160471) was mentioned in <https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/798132> Factory / LibVNCServer ``` [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1160471#c9)  Swamp Workflow Management   2020-05-04 13:18:07 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2020:1164-1: An update that fixes three vulnerabilities is now available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1155419#c0)  Alexandros Toptsoglou   2019-10-30 09:57:25 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-15681  LibVNC commit before d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a contains a memory leak (CWE-655) in VNC server code, which allow an attacker to read stack memory and can be abused for information disclosure. Combined with another vulnerability, it can be used to leak stack memory and bypass ASLR. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity. These vulnerabilities have been fixed in commit d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a.

# USN-4587-1: iTALC vulnerabilities

20 October 2020

Several security issues were fixed in iTALC.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [italc](/security/cves?package=italc) - didact tool which allows teachers to view and control computer labs

## Details

Nicolas Ruff discovered that iTALC had buffer overflows, divide-by-zero errors

and didn't check malloc return values. A remote attacker could use these issues

to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2014-6051](/security/CVE-2014-6051), [CVE-2014-6052](/security/CVE-2014-6052), [CVE-2014-6053](/security/CVE-2014-6053), [CVE-2014-6054](/security/CVE-2014-6054), [CVE-2014-6055](/security/CVE-2014-6055))

Josef Gajdusek discovered that iTALC had heap-based buffer overflow

vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could used these issues to cause a denial of

service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9941](/security/CVE-2016-9941), [CVE-2016-9942](/security/CVE-2016-9942))

It was discovered that iTALC had an out-of-bounds write, multiple heap

out-of-bounds writes, an infinite loop, improper initializations, and null

pointer vulnerabilities. A remote attacker could used these issues to cause a

denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2018-15127](/security/CVE-2018-15127),

[CVE-2018-20019](/security/CVE-2018-20019), [CVE-2018-20020](/security/CVE-2018-20020), [CVE-2018-20021](/security/CVE-2018-20021), [CVE-2018-20022](/security/CVE-2018-20022), [CVE-2018-20023](/security/CVE-2018-20023),

[CVE-2018-20024](/security/CVE-2018-20024), [CVE-2018-20748](/security/CVE-2018-20748), [CVE-2018-20749](/security/CVE-2018-20749), [CVE-2018-20750](/security/CVE-2018-20750), [CVE-2018-7225](/security/CVE-2018-7225),

[CVE-2019-15681](/security/CVE-2019-15681))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [italc-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc)
  -
  [1:2.0.2+dfsg1-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc/1%3A2.0.2%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu0.1)
* [italc-master](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc)
  -
  [1:2.0.2+dfsg1-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc/1%3A2.0.2%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu0.1)
* [libitalccore](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc)
  -
  [1:2.0.2+dfsg1-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/italc/1%3A2.0.2%2Bdfsg1-4ubuntu0.1)

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

• Monitor and restrict access to port 5900/tcp to trusted IP addresses only

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/
industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC ITC Industrial Thin Clients represent powerful control terminals with high-resolution wide-screen
touch displays in 12, 15, 19 and 22 inch formats.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2017-18922

websockets.c in LibVNCServer prior to 0.9.12 did not properly decode certain WebSocket frames.
A malicious attacker could exploit this by sending specially crafted WebSocket frames to a server,
causing a heap-based buffer overﬂow.
