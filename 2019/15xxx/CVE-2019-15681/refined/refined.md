Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2019-15681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a memory leak in the VNC server code of LibVNC. Specifically, when sending a `ServerCutText` message, stack memory is leaked to the remote client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-655:**  Memory Leak
*   Improper handling of the `ServerCutText` message, leading to the exposure of sensitive stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read stack memory, potentially gaining access to sensitive information.
*   **ASLR Bypass:** The vulnerability can be combined with another vulnerability to leak stack memory layout and bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** This vulnerability is exploitable via network connectivity, meaning a remote attacker can trigger the leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker must be able to connect to the vulnerable VNC server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The provided descriptions don't indicate any authentication bypass is necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes from the content:**

*   The vulnerability is present in multiple products that use LibVNCServer, including TightVNC, Vino and iTALC.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves a specific commit `d01e1bb4246323ba6fcee3b82ef1faa9b1dac82a` in the LibVNC repository.
*   Multiple vendors such as Debian, Ubuntu and SUSE issued security updates to address the vulnerability.
*   Some sources suggest the vulnerability is of "moderate" severity. Others consider it "important".
*   The vulnerability is associated with a CVSS v3 score ranging between 4.8 and 7.5 based on the source. The different scores are likely due to variances in the attack complexity and impact on availability.

In summary, CVE-2019-15681 allows a remote attacker to leak sensitive stack memory by connecting to a vulnerable VNC server which could then allow them to bypass ASLR.
