{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Envoy service crashes when processing requests with very long URIs when using a regex matcher for routing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Potential overflow bug in Envoy's regex parser or inefficient handling of long URIs. Lack of input validation/sanitization allowing excessively long URIs to be processed.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability causing the Envoy service to crash.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending HTTP requests with extremely long URIs to an Envoy service that uses regex matching for routing.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Envoy service."
