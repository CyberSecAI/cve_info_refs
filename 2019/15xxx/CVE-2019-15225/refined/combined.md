## Description

![@skambashi](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4984399?u=ae88d3509c6417f639c9ca4be5032807a2df0233&v=4&size=48)[skambashi](https://github.com/skambashi)opened [on Jul 26, 2019](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues/7728#issue-473126532)

*Description*:

We've noticed that requests with a very long URI crashes our envoy service for routes defined using a regex matcher.

We're not sure if it's due to some overflow bug in Envoy's regex parser, but ideally Envoy should not crash because of a long URI.

*Repro steps*:

Define a route with a match regex like the following:

```
"match": {
    "regex": "/asdf/.*"
}

```

and then make a request with a large URI:

```
val longString = "a" * (50 * 1024)
client.send("GET", "/asdf/{longString}")

```

We've gotten around it by using a `prefix` matcher instead, but this appears to be a potential DoS vulnerability if not a security issue.
