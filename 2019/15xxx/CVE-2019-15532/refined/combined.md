## Description

![@SamCodeMed](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6537179?u=187df3800b797df67334a65bcf2353fe4cb3d062&v=4&size=48)[SamCodeMed](https://github.com/SamCodeMed)opened [on Apr 12, 2019](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/issues/539#issue-432610649)
### Summary

While doing a CTF challenge, I was using cyber chef to encode a XSS javascript payload. When I put it through the text encoding brute force, alerts were displayed caused by the script.

### Example

My input was <script>alert('XSS')</script> and when I added the brute force encoding multiple alerts popped up.

### Summary

It looks like [#539](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/issues/539) has been fixed in [01f0625](https://github.com/gchq/CyberChef/commit/01f0625d6a177f9c5df9281f12a27c814c2d8bcf), but no release has been issued since the fix. Would it be possible to do a quick release (v8.31.2) to include the XSS fix? Thanks in advance for your consideration!
