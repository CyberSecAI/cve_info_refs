- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient privilege checking in the ixl(4) driver's ioctl(2) command handlers. Specifically, the handlers failed to verify if the caller had sufficient privileges to perform operations like updating the device's non-volatile memory (NVM).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing privilege checks in the driver-specific ioctl(2) command handlers within the ixl(4) driver. This allowed unprivileged users to invoke operations intended for privileged users.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unprivileged user could trigger updates to the device's NVM, which could potentially lead to device malfunction, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by making ioctl(2) calls to the ixl(4) driver with specific commands intended for privileged operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker only needs to be an unprivileged user on the system. The attacker needs to be able to open the device file and issue ioctl commands.
