  "CVE-2019-15916": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Source": "CVE",
      "Official Description": "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval"
    },
    "Analysis": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "A memory leak occurs in the `register_queue_kobjects()` function within `net/core/net-sysfs.c` in the Linux kernel.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Attackers can cause a denial-of-service by consuming excessive memory.",
      "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by interacting with the net-sysfs interface. It does not require any specific user interaction besides making calls to the affected code path.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local access to the system is required to trigger the vulnerability. No authentication is needed for the local user, but it needs to be able to create network devices via ioctl or similar system calls."
    },
    "Additional Information": {
      "SUSE": "SUSE identified the vulnerability as a memory leak that can lead to a denial-of-service.",
      "RedHat": "Red Hat has a number of RHSA entries related to this vulnerability across multiple products, they mention that the memory leak occurs within `register_queue_kobjects()` in `net/core/net-sysfs.c`. The vulnerability is triggered via vfio DMA mappings and/or creating network devices in general and that SUSE will no longer fix all CVEs in the Linux Kernel anymore, but declare some bug classes as won't fix. Please refer to [TID 21496](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000021496) for more details."
