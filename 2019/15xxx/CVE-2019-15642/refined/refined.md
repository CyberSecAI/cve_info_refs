{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `unserialise_variable` function in `web-lib-funcs.pl` uses `eval` to process data from a POST request without proper sanitization. Specifically, it uses a regex to extract a class name, which is then directly used in an `eval` statement.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization",
      "Code injection",
       "Improper input validation",
      "Remote Code Execution (RCE)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious HTTP POST request with a crafted payload to the `rpc.cgi` endpoint.",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have valid credentials for a Webmin user account and knowledge of how to exploit the unserialise_variable function. They also need to set the User-Agent to 'webmin' and provide Basic Auth credentials. The vulnerability is in the rpc.cgi endpoint."
