The provided content is related to CVE-2019-15124.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `Sanitizer::stripAllTags()` in `includes/specials/SpecialMobileWatchlist.php` of the MobileFrontend extension. This function was intended to remove HTML tags from the edit summary but failed to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The edit summary field was not properly sanitized, allowing a malicious user to inject JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view their mobile watchlist. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted edit summary containing JavaScript.
- The injected JavaScript is executed when a user views the mobile watchlist feed.
- Specifically, the vulnerability exists in the `MobileFrontend Special:Watchlist` feature.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to edit a wiki page.
- The attacker needs to be able to add this page to the watchlist.
- The attacker needs to craft the edit summary to include JavaScript code.
- The victim user needs to view their watchlist on the mobile version of the site.
