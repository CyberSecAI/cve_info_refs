The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the WPS Hide Login plugin for WordPress, specifically version 1.5.2.2. This information is more detailed than a typical CVE description.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

The vulnerabilities stem from flawed logic in the plugin's code that aims to hide the default WordPress login URL (`wp-login.php`) and `wp-admin`. The plugin attempts to intercept requests and redirect users but contains bypasses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Protection Bypass #1:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Inclusion of `wp-login.php` when a specific query parameter (`action=confirmaction`) is present in the URL, bypassing the intended login hiding mechanism.
    *   **Location:** `/classes/plugins.php` line 427.
2.  **Protection Bypass #2:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Access to the login page is granted when the `adminhash` parameter is present in the URL.
    *  **Location:** `/classes/plugins.php` lines 477-480.
3.  **Protection Bypass #3:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Specific query parameters (`action=rp`, `key`, and `login`) used by WooCommerce (and possibly other plugins)  can be exploited to bypass the login page hiding and redirect to the login page.
    *   **Location:** `/classes/plugin.php` lines 653-656.
4.  **Protection Bypass #4:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** By manipulating the `Referer` header to include `wp-login.php`, and sending an empty POST request to `wp-login.php?action=postpass`, the plugin redirects the user to the login page.
    *   **Location:** `/classes/plugin.php` line 563.
5.  **Default Parameter Usage:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** The default login URL is often set to `/login`, which is easily guessed.
    *  **Location:** `/classes/plugin.php`
6.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Triggering the `wps_hide_login_signup_enable` hook with the correct URL results in a fatal error that discloses the full server path due to a missing file inclusion.
    *   **Location:** `/classes/plugin.php` line 498.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Login Hiding:** Attackers can bypass the plugin's login page hiding functionality, allowing them to access the standard login page.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The full path disclosure vulnerability could provide an attacker with sensitive information about the server's file structure.
*   **Brute Force Attacks:** By accessing the login page, attackers can attempt brute-force login attempts on the WordPress site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Requests:** By crafting malicious URLs with specific query parameters (`action=confirmaction`, `adminhash=1`, `action=rp&key&login`).
*   **HTTP POST Requests:** By sending a POST request with a manipulated referer header.
*   **Direct Access:** Default login URL.
*  **URL Manipulation:** By manipulating specific URL parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target WordPress website.
*  No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   Knowledge of the plugin's vulnerable code or the ability to perform reconnaissance to discover the vulnerabilities

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerabilities were patched in version 1.5.3 of the plugin.
*   The secupress.me content provides a detailed analysis of the vulnerabilities with specific code locations, demonstrating a deeper understanding than a basic CVE description.
*   The content highlights how seemingly minor issues in code logic can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.
