CVE-2019-15784
```

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Array overflow in `CSndUList` in Secure Reliable Transport (SRT) library.
*   **Root Cause:** The `CSndUList` which stores SRT sockets to be processed in the sender's thread, had a fixed default size (4096 elements). If the number of SRT connections exceeds this size, an array overflow occurs, leading to out-of-bounds operations.
*   **Affected Versions:** SRT through 1.3.4.
*   **Impact:** An array overflow could lead to partial information disclosure, partial data modification, and/or a denial of service. The CVSS v3 score indicates a high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network.
*   **Exploitation:** The vulnerability is triggered when there are a large number of SRT connections.
*   **Fix:** The `CSndUList::update(...)` function was modified to increase the list size if required. The default size of the `CSndUList` was reduced from 4096 to 512. The functions `CSndUList::remove_(...)` and `CSndUList::insert_norealloc_(...)` were updated to use `std::swap`.
