## Description

A simple and easy to use WordPress SSL plugin which will redirect all non-SSL pages to SSL and ensure that all resources on your SSL pages are loaded over SSL as well.

It includes a user-friendly setup wizard upon activation to check if SSL is supported on the hosting/server before it allows the SSL to be enabled and that ensures that the website doesn’t become inaccessible if SSL is not supported.

#### Plugin Features

* Check if SSL is supported on hosting/server
* Enable SSL with a single click
* Redirects all non-SSL URLs to https://
* Converts all non-SSL resources (images, scripts, stylesheets, etc.) to https:// on pages
* Redirect to non-SSL if SSL is not enabled

See our [online documentation](https://tribulant.com/docs/one-click-ssl-plugin/11098) for more details and detailed instructions.

  If you are already on SSL (https://) the plugin will tell you that and no action is required.

  Configure your SSL to run on specific sections and behave in a certain way as required.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the plugin:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/one-click-ssl` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
3. Use the setup screen after activation to enable SSL or go to the One Click SSL admin menu item to enable.

## FAQ

### What is SSL?

SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer and it is a protocol which encrypts all data in transit on your website to prevent theft, interception, and/or hacking.

### What is required to use SSL?

You need to have SSL support on your hosting/server. This is done by installing an SSL certificate.

### Is SSL mandatory?

No, it is not, but for the security and peace of mind of your users, it is highly recommended. All Internet browsers are warning users about insecure websites, and search engines rank you lower if you do not activate SSL. It is practically a must now.

Sometimes, you are just looking for a small and easy solution – without an overload of functions. That’s exactly what I love about the One Click SSL plugin.

It does http to https redirection and fixes mixed content site-wide.
Great replacement to “Really Simple SSL” after they became “Really Simple Security”.Perfect!
