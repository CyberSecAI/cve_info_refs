- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input, which allows for the injection of arbitrary commands.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. The vulnerability is present in multiple input fields.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote attacker with user-level permissions can execute arbitrary commands on the Bitbucket server instance.
- **Attack vectors**: User-provided input fields. A specially crafted payload injected as user input can trigger the execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have user-level permissions on the affected Bitbucket server instance to exploit this vulnerability.
