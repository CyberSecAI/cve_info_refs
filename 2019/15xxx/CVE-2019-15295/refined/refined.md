- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An untrusted search path vulnerability exists in the `ServiceInstance.dll` library. The application loads DLL files based on the system's search path without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application loads libraries from the system's search path, allowing a malicious DLL with the same name as a library expected by the application to be loaded from an attacker-controlled location
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by placing a malicious DLL within the search path, leading to privilege escalation and system compromise.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to place a malicious DLL in a directory within the system's search path that the vulnerable application will search during the DLL load process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access and the ability to write to a location within the system's search path. The user needs to be tricked into running the application.
