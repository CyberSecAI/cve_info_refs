      "description": "URL path traversal allows information disclosure - CVE-2019-15004\n\nBy design, Jira Service Desk gives customer portal users permissions only to raise requests and view issues. This allows users to interact with the customer portal without having direct access to Jira. These restrictions can be bypassed by a remote attacker with portal access who exploits a path traversal vulnerability. Note that attackers can grant themselves access to Jira Service Desk portals that have the Anyone can email the service desk or raise a request in the portal setting enabled. Exploitation allows an attacker to view all issues within all Jira projects contained in the vulnerable instance. This could include Jira Service Desk projects, Jira Core projects, and Jira Software projects.",
