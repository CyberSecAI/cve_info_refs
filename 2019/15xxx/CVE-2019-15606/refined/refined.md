Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-15606:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Node.js not trimming trailing whitespace in HTTP header values during comparisons for authorization purposes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of proper input sanitization in HTTP header processing. Specifically, trailing optional whitespace (OWS) is not removed or ignored when header values are used for authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** An attacker can bypass authorization checks that rely on comparing header values. By including trailing whitespace in a header, the attacker can manipulate the comparison result and gain unauthorized access to protected resources.
- **HTTP Request Smuggling**: As indicated in Red Hat's description, it could lead to sending an HTTP(s) request which is validated by an upstream proxy server but not by the Node.js server, possibly leading to HTTP request smuggling.
- Red Hat also specifies it can lead to an attacker sending an HTTP(s) request which is validated by an upstream proxy server, but not by the Node.js HTTP(s) server, therefore allowing access to protected resoures.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks, where the attacker sends malicious HTTP requests with crafted header values containing trailing whitespace to Node.js servers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Node.js server that is susceptible to this issue. No specific authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
-   **Affected Node.js Versions:** The vulnerability affects Node.js versions 10.x, 12.x, and 13.x prior to specific fixes.
-   **Fix:** The issue is fixed in Node.js versions 10.19.0, 12.15.0, and 13.8.0.
-   **CVSS Scores:** The provided documents list CVSS scores, which vary between sources (NVD, SUSE), but the severity is high. SUSE rates the vulnerability as important, while Red Hat indicates it as having a medium severity. The main difference in CVSSv3 scoring is regarding the Attack Complexity and User Interaction. NVD scores them as low and none, while SUSE scores them as high and required, respectively.
-   **Specific products affected:**  A large number of SUSE products are affected including SLES, OpenStack Cloud and Rancher products along with a wide variety of Red Hat products.
-   **Red Hat's explanation:** Red Hat clarifies the potential for an attacker to bypass security checks that rely on HTTP header values by including optional whitespace. It also emphasizes that this could lead to HTTP request smuggling.
-   **Mitigation:**  While a proper fix is available through package updates, a workaround mentioned by Node.js is to use the `--insecure-http-parser` command-line flag or the `insecureHTTPParser` http option, effectively disabling the strict parsing.  However, this should be avoided.
-   **Upstream commit:**  The upstream commit fixing the issue is available in the nodejs/node repository.
-   **HackerOne report:** There is a HackerOne report related to the vulnerability, but it is not public.

The provided content from multiple sources provides consistent information regarding the vulnerability, its root cause, impact, and remediation.

**Additional Note**
The Red Hat Bugzilla entries reference an encoding error flaw in Node.js related to reading peer certificates in TLS client authentication as part of **CVE-2019-15604**, which can be exploited to crash the process. It's important to distinguish that this is not the same vulnerability as described in CVE-2019-15606, but rather a different vulnerability that is fixed in the same patch.
