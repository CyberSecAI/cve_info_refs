Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a failure of the XSS filter to properly sanitize user-provided input when displaying survey results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reflective Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. User-supplied input in the `quItemId` and `surveyId` parameters is not properly sanitized before being included in the HTML response.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts (JavaScript) into the user's browser.
- **Cookie Theft:** Attackers can steal cookies of other users, potentially gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.
- **Serious Impact When Combined with CSRF:** The XSS vulnerability becomes even more severe when combined with a CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability. This combination could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of a user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with the XSS payload injected into the `quItemId` or `surveyId` parameters.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker then tricks a victim into clicking this malicious link (e.g., sending via email or chat).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL with the injected script.
- The attacker needs to convince a victim to click the link.
- The attacker does not require prior authentication, as the vulnerability is present in the survey results page, which is likely public.

**Technical Details:**
- **Vulnerable File:** `/diaowen/design/qu-multi-fillblank!answers.action`
- **PoC (Proof of Concept) URL:** `/diaowen/design/qu-multi-fillblank!answers.action?quItemId=2c9790db6c74f25f016c7536aed90022&surveyId=2c9790db6c74f25f016c7"><scr<script>ipt>alert('XSS');</script 200`
- This PoC demonstrates that the script is injected into the HTML, causing the `alert('XSS')` function to be executed in the user's browser, confirming the vulnerability.
