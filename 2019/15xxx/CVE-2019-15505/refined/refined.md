  "CVE-2019-15505": {
    "description": "It was discovered that the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overread. A physically proximate attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive information.",
    "affected_packages": [
      "linux",
      "linux-aws",
       "linux-azure",
       "linux-gcp",
       "linux-gke-5.0",

       "linux-gke-4.15"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device driver in the Linux kernel does not properly validate incoming IR packets, leading to a heap buffer over-read.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "buffer overread",
      "missing bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service (system crash) or possible exposure of sensitive information.",
    "attack_vector": "A physically proximate attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted IR packets to the Technisat DVB-S/S2 USB device.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A physically proximate attacker with the ability to send crafted IR packets to the vulnerable device.",
    "details": "The vulnerability exists because there is no boundary check applied to an array (`state->buf`) within the `technisat_usb2_state` struct when handling incoming IR packets. Specifically, the code iterates through this buffer until it encounters a `0xff` byte. If no such byte is found within the buffer's bounds, the code reads past the end of the buffer. This can lead to either a system crash or, potentially, the exposure of sensitive kernel data."
