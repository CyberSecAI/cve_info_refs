> Abstract:Distribution Service (DDS) is a realtime peer-to-peer protocol that serves as a scalable middleware between distributed networked systems found in many Industrial IoT domains such as automotive, medical, energy, and defense. Since the initial ratification of the standard, specifications have introduced a Security Model and Service Plugin Interface (SPI) architecture, facilitating authenticated encryption and data centric access control while preserving interoperable data exchange. However, as Secure DDS v1.1, the default plugin specifications presently exchanges digitally signed capability lists of both participants in the clear during the crypto handshake for permission attestation; thus breaching confidentiality of the context of the connection. In this work, we present an attacker model that makes use of network reconnaissance afforded by this leaked context in conjunction with formal verification and model checking to arbitrarily reason about the underlying topology and reachability of information flow, enabling targeted attacks such as selective denial of service, adversarial partitioning of the data bus, or vulnerability excavation of vendor implementations.

DDS Security, v1.1

1  Scope

1.1  General

This specification adds several new “DDS Security Support” compliance points (“profile”) to the DDS
Specification. See the compliance levels within the Conformance Clause below.

1.2  Overview of this Specification

This specification defines the Security Model and Service Plugin Interface (SPI) architecture for
compliant DDS implementations. The DDS Security Model is enforced by the invocation of these SPIs
by the DDS implementation. This specification also defines a set of builtin implementations of these
SPIs.

•  The specified builtin SPI implementations enable out-of-the box security and interoperability

between compliant DDS applications.

•  The use of SPIs allows DDS users to customize the behavior and technologies that the DDS

implementations use for Information Assurance, specifically customization of Authentication,
Access Control, Encryption, Message Authentication, Digital Signing, Logging and Data
Tagging.

This specification defines five SPIs that when combined together provide Information Assurance to
DDS systems:

•  Authentication Service Plugin. Provides the means to verify the identity of the application

and/or user that invokes operations on DDS. Includes facilities to perform mutual
authentication between participants and establish a shared secret.

•  AccessControl Service Plugin. Provides the means to enforce policy decisions on what DDS
related operations an authenticated user can perform. For example, which domains it can join,
which Topics it can publish or subscribe to, etc.

•  Cryptographic Service Plugin. Implements (or interfaces with libraries that implement) all

cryptographic operations including encryption, decryption, hashing, digital signatures, etc. This
includes the means to derive keys from a shared secret.

•  Logging Service Plugin. Supports auditing of all DDS security-relevant events.

•  Data Tagging Service Plugin. Provides a way to add tags to data samples.

DDS Security, v1.1

2  Conformance

2.1  Conformance points

This specification defines the following conformance points:

(1) Builtin plugin interoperability (mandatory)
(2) Plugin framework (mandatory)
(3) Plugin language APIs (optional)
(4) Logging and Tagging (optional)

Conformance with the “DDS Security” specification requires conformance with all the mandatory
conformance points.

2.2  Builtin plugin interoperability (mandatory)

This point provides interoperability with all the builtin plugins with the exception of the Logging
plugin. Conformance to this point requires conformance to:

•  Clause 7 (the security model and the support for interoperability between DDS Security

implementations).

•  The configuration of the plugins and the observable wire-protocol behavior specified in Clause 9

(the builtin-plugins), except for sub clause 9.6. This conformance point does not require
implementation of the APIs between the DDS implementation and the plugins.

2.3  Plugin framework (mandatory)

This point provides the architectural framework and abstract APIs needed to develop new security
plugins and “plug them” into a DDS middleware implementation. Plugins developed using this
framework are portable between conforming DDS implementations. However portability for a specific
programming language also requires conformance to the specific language API (see 2.4).

Conformance to this point requires conformance to:

•  Clause 7 (the security model and the support for interoperability between DDS Security

implementations).

•  Clause 8 (the plugin model) with the exception of 8.6 and 8.7 (Logging and Data Tagging plugins).
The conformance to the plugin model is at the UML level; it does not mandate a particular language
mapping.

•  Clause 9, the builtin-plugins, except for 9.6 (Builtin Logging Plugin).

In addition it requires the conforming DDS implementation to provide a public API to insert the
plugins that conform to the aforementioned sections.

2.4  Plugin Language APIs (optional)

These conformance points provide portability across compliant DDS implementations of the security
plugins developed using a specific programming language.

Conformance to any of the language portability points requires conformance to the (mandatory) plugin
architecture framework point.

DDS Security, v1.1

3

There are 5 “plugin language API” points, each corresponding to a different programming language
used to implement the plugins.

Each language point is a separate independent conformance point. Conformance with the “plugin
language API” point requires conformance with at least one of the 5 language APIs enumerated below:

•  C Plugin APIs. Conformance to sub clauses 10.2 and 10.3
•  C++ classic Plugin APIs. Conformance to sub clauses 10.2 and 10.4
•  Java classic Plugin APIs. Conformance to sub clauses 10.2 and 10.5
•  C++11 Plugin APIs. Conformance to sub clauses 10.2 and 10.6
•  Java5+ Plugin APIs. Conformance to sub clauses 10.2 and 10.7

2.5  Logging and Tagging profile (optional)

This point adds support for logging and tagging. Conformance to this point requires conformance to
sub clauses 8.6, 8.7, and 9.6.

6  Additional Information

6.1  Changes to Adopted OMG Specifications

This specification does not modify any existing adopted OMG specifications. It reuses and/or adds
functionality on top of the current set of OMG specifications.

•  DDS: This specification does not modify or invalidate any existing DDS profiles or compliance

levels. It extends some of the DDS builtin Topics to carry additional information in a
compatible way with existing implementations of DDS.

•  DDS-RTPS: This specification does not require any modifications to RTPS; however, it may
impact interoperability with existing DDS-RTPS implementations. In particular, DDS-RTPS
implementations that do not implement the DDS Security specification will have limited
interoperability with implementations that do implement the mechanisms introduced by this
specification. Interoperability is limited to systems configured to allow “unauthorized”
DomainParticipant entities and within those systems, only to Topics configured to be
“unprotected.”

•  DDS-XTYPES: This specification depends on the IDL syntax introduced by and the Extended

CDR encoding defined in the DDS-XTYPES specification. It does not require any
modifications of DDS-XTYPES.

•  OMG IDL: This specification does not modify any existing IDL-related compliance levels.

7  Support for DDS Security

7.1  Security Model

The Security Model for DDS defines the security principals (users of the system), the objects that are
being secured, and the operations on the objects that are to be restricted. DDS applications share
information on DDS Global Data Spaces (called DDS Domains) where the information is organized
into Topics and accessed by means of read and write operations on data-instances of those Topics.

Ultimately what is being secured is a specific DDS Global Data Space (domain) and, within the
domain, the ability to access (read or write) information (specific Topic or even data-object instances
within the Topic) in the DDS Global Data Space.

Securing DDS means providing:

•  Confidentiality of the data samples

•

Integrity of the data samples and the messages that contain them

•  Authentication of DDS writers and readers

•  Authorization of DDS writers and readers

•  Message-origin authentication

•  Data-origin authentication

•

(Optional) Non-repudiation of data

To provide secure access to the DDS Global Data Space, applications that use DDS must first be
authenticated, so that the identity of the application (and potentially the user that interacts with it) can
be established. Once authentication has been obtained, the next step is to enforce access control
decisions that determine whether the application is allowed to perform specific actions. Examples of
actions are: joining a DDS Domain, defining a new Topic, reading or writing a specific DDS Topic,
and even reading or writing specific Topic instances (as identified by the values of key fields in the
data). Enforcement of access control shall be supported by cryptographic techniques so that
information confidentiality and integrity can be maintained, which in turn requires an infrastructure to
manage and distribute the necessary cryptographic keys.

7.1.1  Threats

In order to understand the decisions made in the design of the plugins, it is important to understand
some of the specific threats impacting applications that use DDS and DDS Interoperability Wire
Protocol (RTPS).

Most relevant are four categories of threats:

1.  Unauthorized subscription

2.  Unauthorized publication

3.  Tampering and replay

4.  Unauthorized access to data

DDS Security, v1.1

13

These threats are described in the context of a hypothetical communication scenario with six actors all
attached to the same network:

•  Alice. A DDS DomainParticipant who is authorized to publish data on a Topic T.

•  Bob. A DDS DomainParticipant who is authorized to subscribe to data on a Topic T.

•  Eve. An eavesdropper. Someone who is not authorized to subscribe to data on Topic T.

However Eve uses the fact that she is connected to the same network to try to see the data.

•  Trudy. An intruder. A DomainParticipant who is not authorized to publish on Topic T.

However, Trudy uses the fact that she is connected to the same network to try to send data.

•  Mallory. A malicious DDS DomainParticipant. Mallory is authorized to subscribe to data on
Topic T but she is not authorized to publish on Topic T. However, Mallory will try to use
information gained by subscribing to the data to publish in the network and try to convince Bob
that she is a legitimate publisher.

•  Trent. A trusted service who needs to receive and send information on Topic T. For example,
Trent can be a persistence service or a relay service. He is trusted to relay information without
having malicious intent. However he is not trusted to see the content of the information.

Figure 2 – Threat actors

7.1.1.1  Unauthorized Subscription

The DomainParticipant Eve is connected to the same network infrastructure as the rest of the agents
and is able to observe the network packets despite the fact that the messages are not intended to be sent
to Eve. Many scenarios can lead to this situation. Eve could tap into a network switch or observe the
communication channels. Alternatively, in situations where Alice and Bob are communicating over
multicast, Eve could simply subscribe to the same multicast address.

Protecting against Eve is reasonably simple. All that is required is for Alice to encrypt the data she
writes using a secret key that is only shared with authorized receivers such as Bob, Trent, and Mallory.

DDS Security, v1.1

7.1.1.2  Unauthorized Publication

The DomainParticipant Trudy is connected to the same network infrastructure as the rest of the agents
and is able to inject network packets with any data contents, headers and destination she wishes (e.g.,
Bob). The network infrastructure will route those packets to the indicated destination.

To protect against Trudy, Bob, Trent and Mallory need to realize that the data is not originating from
Alice. They need to realize that the data is coming from someone not authorized to send data on Topic
T and therefore reject (i.e., not process) the packet.

Protecting against Trudy is also reasonably simple. All that is required is for the protocol to require that
the messages include either a hash-based message authentication code (HMAC) or digital signature.

•  An HMAC creates a message authentication code using a secret key that is shared with the

intended recipients. Alice would only share the secret key with Bob, Mallory and Trent so that
they can recognize messages that originate from Alice. Since Trudy is not authorized to publish
Topic T, Bob and the others will not recognize any HMACs Trudy produces (i.e., they will not
recognize Trudy’s key).

•  A digital signature is based on public key cryptography. To create a digital signature, Alice

encrypts a digest of the message using Alice’s private key. Everybody (including Bob, Mallory
and Trent) has access to Alice’s public key. Similar to the HMAC above, the recipients can
identify messages from Alice, as they are the only ones whose digital signature can be
interpreted with Alice’s public key. Any digital signatures Trudy may use will be rejected by the
recipients, as Trudy is not authorized to write Topic T.

The use of HMACs versus digital signatures presents tradeoffs that will be discussed further in
subsequent sections. Suffice it to say that in many situations the use of HMACs is preferred because
the performance to compute and verify them is about 1000 times faster than the performance of
computing/verifying digital signatures.

7.1.1.3  Tampering and Replay

Mallory is authorized to subscribe to Topic T. Therefore Alice has shared with Mallory the secret key
to encrypt the topic and also, if an HMAC is used, the secret key used for the HMAC.

Assume Alice used HMACs instead of digital signatures. Then Mallory can use her knowledge of the
secret keys used for data encryption and the HMACs to create a message on the network and pretend it
came from Alice. Mallory can fake all the TCP/UDP/IP headers and any necessary RTPS identifiers
(e.g., Alice’s RTPS DomainParticipant and DataWriter GUIDs). Mallory has the secret key that was
used to encrypt the data so she can create encrypted data payloads with any contents she wants. She
has the secret key used to compute HMACs so she can also create a valid HMAC for the new message.
Bob and the others will have no way to see that the message came from Mallory and will accept it,
thinking it came from Alice.

So if Alice used an HMAC, the only solution to the problem is that the secret key used for the HMAC
when sending the message to Mallory cannot be the same as the key used for the HMAC when sending
messages to Bob. In other words, Alice must share a different secret key for the HMAC with each
recipient. Then Mallory will not have the HMAC key that Bob expects from Alice and the messages
from Mallory to Bob will not be misinterpreted as coming from Alice.

Recall that Alice needs to be able to use multicast to communicate efficiently with multiple receivers.
Therefore, if Alice wants to send an HMAC with a different key for every receiver, the only solution is

DDS Security, v1.1

15

to append multiple HMACs to the multicast message with some key-id that allows the recipient to
select the correct HMAC to verify.

If Alice uses digital signatures to protect the integrity of the message, then this ‘masquerading’
problem does not arise and Alice can send the same digital signature to all recipients. This makes using
multicast simpler. However, the performance penalty of using digital signatures is so high that in many
situations it will be better to compute and send multiple HMACs as described earlier.

7.1.1.4  Unauthorized Access to Data by Infrastructure Services

Infrastructure services, such as the DDS Persistence Service or relay services need to be able to receive
messages, verify their integrity, store them, and send them to other participants on behalf of the
original application.

These services can be trusted not to be malicious; however, often it is not desirable to grant them the
privileges they would need to understand the contents of the data. They are allowed to store and
forward the data, but not to see inside the data.

Trent is an example of such a service. To support deployment of these types of services, the security
model needs to support the concept of having a participant, such as Trent, who is allowed to receive,
process, and relay RTPS messages, but is not allowed to see the contents of the data within the
message. In other words, he can see the headers and sample information (writer GUID, sequence
numbers, keyhash and such) but not the message contents.

To support services like Trent, Alice needs to accept Trent as a valid destination for her messages on
topic T and share with Trent only the secret key used to compute the HMAC for Trent, but not the
secret key used to encrypt the data itself. In addition, Bob, Mallory and others need to accept Trent as
someone who is able to write on Topic T and relay messages from Alice. This means two things: (1)
accept and interpret messages encrypted with Alice’s secret key and (2) allow Trent to include in his
sample information, the information he got from Alice (writer GUID, sequence number and anything
else needed to properly process the relayed message).

Assume Alice used an HMAC in the message sent to Trent. Trent will have received from Alice the
secret key needed to verify the HMAC properly. Trent will be able to store the messages, but lacking
the secret key used for its encryption, will be unable to see the data. When he relays the message to
Bob, he will include the information that indicates the message originated from Alice and produce an
HMAC with its own secret HMAC key that was shared with Bob. Bob will receive the message, verify
the HMAC and see it is a relayed message from Alice. Bob recognizes Trent is authorized to relay
messages, so Bob will accept the sample information that relates to Alice and process the message as if
it had originated with Alice. In particular, he will use Alice’s secret key to decrypt the data.

If Alice had used digital signatures, Trent would have two choices. If the digital signature only covered
the data and the sample information he needs to relay from Alice, Trent could simply relay the digital
signature as well. Otherwise, Trent could strip out the digital signature and put in his own HMAC.
Similar to before, Bob recognizes that Trent is allowed to relay messages from Alice and will be able
to properly verify and process the message.

7.2  Types used by DDS Security

The DDS security specification includes extensions to the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol (DDS-
RTPS), as well as, new API-level functions in the form of Security Plugins. The types described in this
sub clause are used in these extensions.

16

DDS Security, v1.1

7.2.1  Property_t

Section 9.3.2 of the DDS-RTPS specification defines Property_t as a data type that holds a pair of
strings. One string is considered the property “name” and the other is the property “value” associated
with that name.

The DDS Security specification extends the DDS-RTPS definition of Property_t to contain the
additional boolean attribute “propagate” used to indicate whether a property is intended for local use
only or should be propagated by DDS discovery.

The DDS-Security specification uses Property_t sequences as a generic data type to configure the
security plugins, pass metadata and provide an extensible mechanism for vendors to configure the
behavior of their plugins without breaking portability or interoperability.

Property_t objects with names that start with the prefix “dds.sec.” are reserved by this
specification, including future versions of this specification. Plugin implementers can also use this
mechanism to pass metadata and configure the behavior of their plugins. In order to avoid collisions
with the value of the “name” attribute, implementers shall use property names that start with a prefix to
an ICANN domain name they own, in reverse order. For example, the prefix would be “com.acme.”
for plugins developed by a hypothetical vendor that owns the domain “acme.com”.

The names and interpretation of the expected properties shall be specified by each plugin
implementation.

7.2.1.1

IDL Representation for Property_t

The Property_t type may be used for information exchange over the network. When a
Property_t is sent over the network it shall be serialized using Extended CDR format according to
the Extended IDL representation [3] below.

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct Property_t {
  string name;
  string value;
   @non-serialized boolean propagate;
};
typedef sequence< Property_t > PropertySeq;

7.2.2  BinaryProperty_t

BinaryProperty_t is a data type that holds a string and an octet sequence. The string is
considered the property “name” and the octet sequence the property “value” associated with that name.

DDS Security, v1.1

17

Sequences of BinaryProperty_t are used as a generic data type to configure the plugins, pass
metadata and provide an extensible mechanism for vendors to configure the behavior of their plugins
without breaking portability or interoperability.

BinaryProperty_t also contains the boolean attribute “propagate”. Similar to Property_t
this attribute is used to indicate whether the corresponding binary property is intended for local use
only or shall be propagated by DDS discovery.

BinaryProperty_t objects with a “name” attribute that start with the prefix “dds.sec.” are
reserved by this specification, including future versions of this specification.

Plugin implementers may use this mechanism to pass metadata and configure the behavior of their
plugins. In order to avoid collisions with the value of the “name”, attribute implementers shall use
property names that start with a prefix to an ICANN domain name they own, in reverse order. For
example, the prefix would be “com.acme.” for plugins developed by a hypothetical vendor that owns
the domain “acme.com”.

The valid values of the “name” attribute and the interpretation of the associated “value” shall be
specified by each plugin implementation.

struct BinaryProperty_t {
  string name;
  OctetSeq value;
   @non-serialized boolean propagate;
};
typedef sequence< BinaryProperty_t > BinaryPropertySeq;

7.2.3  DataHolder

DataHolder is a data type used to hold generic data. It contains various attributes used to store data
of different types and formats. DataHolder appears as a building block for other types, such as
Token and GenericMessageData.

the Extended IDL representation [3] below.

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct DataHolder {
    string             class_id;
    PropertySeq        properties;
    BinaryPropertySeq  binary_properties;

};

typedef sequence<DataHolder> DataHolderSeq;

7.2.4  Token

The Token class provides a generic mechanism to pass information between security plugins using
DDS as the transport. Token objects are meant for transmission over the network using DDS either
embedded within the builtin topics sent via DDS discovery or via special DDS Topic entities defined in
this specification.

The Token class is structurally identical to the DataHolder class and therefore has the same
structure for all plugin implementations. However, the contents and interpretation of the Token
objects shall be specified by each plugin implementation.

There are multiple specializations of the Token class. They all share the same format, but are used for
different purposes. This is modeled by defining specialized classes.

tokens. In order to avoid collisions, the class_id they use shall start with a prefix to an ICANN domain
name they own, using the same rules specified in 7.2.1 for property names.

7.2.4.2

IDL Representation for Token and Specialized Classes

The Token class is used to hold information exchanged over the network. When a Token is sent over
the network, it shall be serialized using Extended CDR format according to the Extended IDL
representation below:

typedef CryptoTokenSeq DatareaderCryptoTokenSeq;

7.2.4.3  TokenNIL

This name refers to the Token object having class_id set to the empty string, and both properties and
binary_properties sequences set to the empty sequence.

The TokenNIL object is used to indicate the absence of a Token.

7.2.5  PropertyQosPolicy, DomainParticipantQos, DataWriterQos, and DataReaderQos

This specification also introduces an additional Qos policy called PropertyQosPolicy, which is
defined by the following extended IDL:

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct PropertyQosPolicy {
  PropertySeq        value;
  BinaryPropertySeq  binary_value;
};

The PropertyQosPolicy applies to the following DDS entities: DomainParticipant,
DataWriter, and DataReader. To allow configuration of this policy from the DDS API the DDS
Security specification extends the definitions of the DDS defined types DomainParticipantQos,
DataWriterQos, and DataReaderQos with the additional member “property” of type
PropertyQosPolicy as indicated in the extended IDL snippets below.
This specification also introduces a Qos policy called DataTagQosPolicy, defined by the
following IDL:

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct Tag {
    string name;
    string value;
};

typedef sequence<Tag> TagSeq;

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct DataTags {
    TagSeq tags;
};

typedef DataTags DataTagQosPolicy;

@extensibility(MUTABLE)
struct DomainParticipantQos {
   // Existing policies from the DDS specification

DDS Security, v1.1

21

  PropertyQosPolicy  property;
};
@extensibility(MUTABLE)
struct DataWriterQos {
   // Existing policies from the DDS specification
  PropertyQosPolicy  property;
  DataTagQosPolicy   data_tags;
};

@extensibility(MUTABLE)
struct DataReaderQos {
   // Existing policies from the DDS specification
  PropertyQosPolicy  property;
  DataTagQosPolicy   data_tags;
};

The PropertyQosPolicy shall be propagated via DDS discovery so it appears in the
ParticipantBuiltinTopicData, PublicationBuiltinTopicData, and
SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData (see 7.4.1.3, 7.4.1.7, and 7.4.1.8). This is used by the plugins
to check configuration compatibility. Not all name/value pairs within the underlying PropertySeq
and BinaryPropertySeq are propagated. Specifically only the ones with propagate=TRUE are
propagated via DDS discovery and shall appear in the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData,
PublicationBuiltinTopicData, and SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData.

7.2.6  ParticipantGenericMessage

This specification introduces additional builtin DataWriter and DataReader entities used to send
generic messages between the participants. To support these entities, this specification uses a general-
purpose data type called ParticipantGenericMessage, which is defined by the following
extended IDL:

typedef octet[16] GUID_t;
@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct MessageIdentity {
  GUID_t source_guid;
  long long sequence_number;
};

typedef string<> GenericMessageClassId;

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct ParticipantGenericMessage {
   /* target for the request. Can be GUID_UNKNOWN */
  MessageIdentity message_identity;
  MessageIdentity related_message_identity;
  GUID_t destination_participant_guid;
  GUID_t destination_endpoint_guid;
  GUID_t source_endpoint_guid;
  GenericMessageClassId   message_class_id;
  DataHolderSeq           message_data;
};

22

DDS Security, v1.1

The type GUID_t refers to the type defined in the DDS-RTPS specification [2]. See clause 7.3.3 for
additional details on the GUID_t.

7.2.7  ParticipantSecurityInfo

This specification introduces a new set of participant security attributes, described in Section 8.4.2.4.

In order to communicate, two participants need to have a compatible configuration for participant
security attributes. To support making matching decisions upon discovering a remote participant, this
specification defines a new parameter ID for ParticipantBuiltinTopicData topic,
PID_PARTICIPANT_SECURITY_INFO (see Section 7.4.1.4). The type for that Parameter IDs is
defined by the following extended IDL:

typedef unsigned long ParticipantSecurityAttributesMask;
typedef unsigned long PluginParticicipantSecurityAttributesMask;

@extensibility (APPENDABLE)
struct ParticipantSecurityInfo {
  ParticipantSecurityAttributesMask       participant_security_atributes;
  PluginParticipantSecurityAttributesMask
                                  plugin_participant_security_attributes;
};
#define  PARTICIPANT_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES_FLAG_IS_VALID (0x1 << 31)

The default value for the info ParticipantSecurityInfo sets both masks to zero:

#define  PARTICIPANT_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES_INFO_DEFAULT {0, 0}

A compatible configuration is defined as having the same value for all of the attributes in the
ParticipantSecurityInfo, except that when comparing two masks the most significant bit is
interpreted in a special manner as described below.

The most-significant bit of PluginParticipantSecurityAttributesMask and
ParticipantSecurityAttributesMask is called the is_valid bit and specifies whether the
rest of the mask is valid. If the is_valid is set to zero on either of the masks, the comparison between
the local and remote setting for the ParticipantSecurityInfo shall ignore the attribute. This
allows new implementations to be backwards compatible with old implementations by either not
sending the ParticipantSecurityInfo (the default value of zero has is_valid=0) or sending it
with is_valid.

The value of the plugin_participant_security_attributes shall be defined the security plugin
implementation, and are opaque to the DDS middleware (other than the is_valid bit). They allow the
middleware to make matching decisions using the
PluginParticipantSecurityAttributesMask without interpreting it. The definition for
the builtin plugins is detailed in clause 9.4.2.3.

7.2.8  EndpointSecurityInfo

This specification defines a plugin-independent endpoint security attributes, described in clause
8.4.2.7. Additionally, plugin implementations can also have their own plugin-specific attributes, see
clause 9.4.2.5.

DDS Security, v1.1

23

In order to communicate, two endpoints need to have a compatible configuration for endpoint security
attributes.

To support making matching decisions upon discovering a remote endpoint, this specification defines a
new parameter ID for PublicationBuiltinTopicData and SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData topics,
PID_ENDPOINT_SECURITY_INFO (see Section 7.4.1.5). The type for that Parameter IDs is defined
by the following extended IDL:

typedef unsigned long EndpointSecurityAttributesMask;
typedef unsigned long PluginEndpointSecurityAttributesMask;

@extensibility(APPENDABLE)
struct EndpointSecurityInfo {
  EndpointSecurityAttributesMask       endpoint_security_attributes;
  PluginEndpointSecurityAttributesMask plugin_endpoint_security_attributes;
};
#define  ENDPOINT_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES_FLAG_IS_VALID (0x1 << 31)

The default value for the EndpointSecurityInfo is both attributes set to the value zero.

#define  ENDPOINT_SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES_INFO_DEFAULT {0, 0}
A compatible configuration is defined as having the same value for all of the attributes in the
EndpointSecurityInfo, except that when comparing two masks the most significant bit is
interpreted in a special manner as described below.

The most-significant bit of PluginEndpointSecurityAttributesMask and
EndpointSecurityAttributesMask is called the is_valid bit and specifies whether the rest of
the mask is valid. If the is_valid is set to zero on either of the masks, the comparison between the local
and remote setting for the EndpointSecurityInfo shall ignore the attribute. This allows new
implementations to be backwards compatible with old implementations by either not sending the
EndpointSecurityInfo (the default value of zero has is_valid=0) or sending it with is_valid bit
set to zero in one or both attributes.

The value of the plugin_endpoint_security_attributes shall be defined by the security plugin
implementation, and is opaque to the DDS middleware (other than the is_valid bit). It allows the
middleware to make matching decisions using the
PluginEndpointSecurityAttributesMask without interpreting it. The definition for the
builtin plugins is detailed in clause 9.4.2.5.

7.2.9  Additional DDS Return Code: NOT_ALLOWED_BY_SECURITY

The DDS specification defines a set of return codes that may be returned by the operations on the DDS
API (see sub clause 7.1.1 of the DDS specification).

The DDS Security specification adds an additional return code NOT_ALLOWED_BY_SECURITY,
which shall be returned by any operation on the DDS API that fails because the security plugins do not
allow it.

7.3  Securing DDS Messages on the Wire

OMG DDS uses the Real-Time Publish-Subscribe (RTPS) on-the-wire protocol [2] for communicating
data. The RTPS protocol includes specifications on how discovery is performed, the metadata sent

24

DDS Security, v1.1

during discovery, and all the protocol messages and handshakes required to ensure reliability. RTPS
also specifies how messages are put together.

7.3.1  RTPS Background (Non-Normative)

In a secure system where efficiency and message latency are also considerations, it is necessary to
define exactly what needs to be secured. Some applications may require only the data payload to be
confidential and it is acceptable for the discovery information, as well as, the reliability meta-traffic
(HEARTBEATs, ACKs, NACKs, etc.) to be visible, as long as it is protected from modification. Other
applications may also want to keep the metadata (sequence numbers, in-line QoS) and/or the reliability
traffic (ACKs, NACKs, HEARTBEATs) confidential. In some cases, the discovery information (who is
publishing what and its QoS) may need to be kept confidential as well.

To help clarify these requirements, sub clause 7.3.1 explains the structure of the RTPS Message and
the different Submessages it may contain.

RTPS Message

RTPS Header

RTPS SubMessage

RTPS SubMessage

SubMsg Header

SerializedPayload

RTPS SubMessage

Figure 4 – RTPS message structure

An RTPS Message is composed of a leading RTPS Header followed by a variable number of RTPS
Submessages. Each RTPS Submessage is composed of a SubmessageHeader followed by a
variable number of SubmessagElements. There are various kinds of SubmessageElements to
communicate things like sequence numbers, unique identifiers for DataReader and DataWriter entities,
SerializedKeys or KeyHash of the application data, source timestamps, QoS, etc. There is one kind of
SubmessageElement called SerializedPayload that is used to carry the data sent by DDS
applications.

For the purposes of securing communications we distinguish three types of RTPS Submessages:

DDS Security, v1.1

25

1.  DataWriter Submessages. These are the RTPS submessages sent by a DataWriter to one or
more DataReader entities. These include the Data, DataFrag, Gap, Heartbeat, and
HeartbeatFrag submessages.

2.  DataReader Submessages. These are the RTPS submessages sent by a DataReader to one or

more DataWriter entities. These include the AckNack and NackFrag submessages.

3.  Interpreter Submessages. These are the RTPS submessages that are destined to the Message
Interpreter and affect the interpretation of subsequent submessages. These include all the
“Info” messages.

The only RTPS submessages that contain application data are the Data and DataFrag. The
application data is contained within the SerializedPayload submessage element. In addition to
the SerializedPayload these submessages contain sequence numbers, inline QoS, the Key Hash,
identifiers of the originating DataWriter and destination DataReader, etc.

The Data, and DataFrag submessages contain a ParameterList submessage element called
inlineQos (see section 8.3.7 of the DDS-RTPS specification version 2.2). The inlineQos holds
metadata associated with the submessage. It is encoded as a ParameterList (see section 9.4.2.11
of the DDS-RTPS specification version 2.2). ParameterList is a list of {parameterID, length,
value} tuples terminated by a sentinel. One of these parameters is the KeyHash.
The KeyHash parameter may only appear in the Data and DataFrag submessages. Depending on
the data type associated with the DataWriter that wrote the data, the KeyHash parameter contains
either:

•  a serialized representation of the values of all the attributes declared as ‘key’ attributes in the

associated data type, or

•  an MD5 hash computed over the aforementioned serialized key attributes.

Different RTPS Submessage within the same RTPS Message may originate on different
DataWriter or DataReader entities within the DomainParticipant that sent the RTPS message.
It is also possible for a single RTPS Message to combine submessages that originated on different
DDS DomainParticipant entities. This is done by preceding the set of RTPS Submessages that
originate from a common DomainParticipant with an InfoSource RTPS submessage.
The RTPS header contains the version of the RTPS protocol composed of a Major Version and Minor
Version numbers.

As specified in clause 8.6.1 of the DDS-RTPS specification, changes to the RTPS protocol that do not
break interoperability should increase the Minor Version number. These changes include additional
submessages, additional builtin-endpoints, and additional parameterIds. The DDS Security
specification makes these kinds of changes to the RTPS protocol and therefore must increase the RTPS
minor version number.

7.3.2  Secure RTPS Messages

Sub clause 7.1.1 identified the threats addressed by the DDS Security specification. To protect against
the “Unauthorized Subscription” threat it is necessary to use encryption to protect the sensitive parts of
the RTPS message.

Depending on the application requirements, it may be that the only thing that should be kept
confidential is the content of the application data; that is, the information contained in the

26

DDS Security, v1.1

SerializedPayload RTPS submessage element. However, other applications may also consider
the information in other RTPS SubmessageElements (e.g., sequence numbers, KeyHash, and
unique writer/reader identifiers) to be confidential. So the entire Data (or DataFrag) submessage
may need to be encrypted. Similarly, certain applications may consider other submessages such as
Gap, AckNack, Heartbeat, HeartbeatFrag, etc. also to be confidential.
For example, a Gap RTPS Submessage instructs a DataReader that a range of sequence numbers
is no longer relevant. If an attacker can modify or forge a Gap message from a DataWriter, it can
trick the DataReader into ignoring the data that the DataWriter is sending.
To protect against “Unauthorized Publication” and “Tampering and Replay” threats, messages must be
signed using secure hashes or digital signatures. Depending on the application, it may be sufficient to
sign only the application data (SerializedPayload submessage element), the whole
Submessage, and/or the whole RTPS Message.
To support different deployment scenarios, this specification uses a “message transformation”
mechanism that gives the Security Plugin Implementations fine-grain control over which parts of the
RTPS Message need to be encrypted and/or signed.
The Message Transformation performed by the Security Plugins transforms an RTPS Message into
another RTPS Message. A new RTPS Header may be added and the content of the original RTPS
Message may be encrypted, protected by a Secure Message Authentication Code (MAC), and/or
signed. The MAC and/or signature can also include the RTPS Header to protect its integrity.

7.3.3  Constraints of the DomainParticipant GUID_t (GUID)

The DDS-RTPS specification [2] states that DDS DomainParticipant entities are identified by a
unique 16-byte GUID with type GUID_t. In this DDS-Security specification the type GUID_t refers
to the same type defined in clauses 8.4.2.1 and 9.3.1 of the DDS-RTPS specification [2]:

// From DDS-RTPS [2] clauses 8.4.2.1 and 9.3.1
typedef octet GuidPrefix_t[12];
struct EntityId_t {
    octet entityKey[3];
    octet entityKind;
};
struct GUID_t {
    GuidPrefix_t prefix;
    EntityId_t   entityId;
};

This DomainParticipant GUID is communicated as part of DDS Discovery in the
SPDPdiscoveredParticipantData (see DDS-RTPS specification [2] clauses 8.5.3.2 and 9.3.1.3).

Allowing a DomainParticipant to select its GUID arbitrarily would allow hostile applications to
perform a “squatter” attack, whereby a DomainParticipant with a valid certificate could
announce itself into the DDS Domain with the GUID of some other DomainParticipant. Once
authenticated the “squatter” DomainParticipant would preclude the real

one.
from being discovered, because its GUID would be detected as a duplicate

 of the already existing
DomainParticipant

DDS Security, v1.1

27

To prevent the aforementioned “squatter” attack, this specification constrains the GUID that can be
chosen by a DomainParticipant, so that it is tied to the Identity of the DomainParticipant.
This is enforced by the Authentication plugin.

7.3.4  Mandatory use of the KeyHash for encrypted messages

The RTPS Data and DataFrag submessages can optionally contain the KeyHash as an inline Qos
(see sub clause 9.6.3.3, titled “KeyHash (PID_KEY_HASH)”) of the DDS-RTPS specification version
2.3. In this sub clause it is specified that when present, the key hash shall be computed either as the
serialized key or as an MD5 on the serialized key.

The key values are logically part of the data and therefore in situations where the data is considered
sensitive the key should also be considered sensitive.

For this reason the DDS Security specification imposes additional constraints in the use of the key
hash. These constraints apply only to the Data or DataFrag RTPS SubMessages where the
SerializedPayload SubmessageElement is encrypted by the operation
encode_serialized_payload of the CryptoTransform plugin:

(1) The KeyHash shall be included in the Inline Qos.
(2) The KeyHash shall be computed as the 128 bit MD5 Digest (IETF RFC 1321) applied to the
CDR Big- Endian encapsulation of all the Key fields in sequence. Unlike the rule stated in sub
clause 9.6.3.3 of the DDS specification, the MD5 hash shall be used regardless of the
maximum-size of the serialized key.

These rules accomplish two objectives:

(1) Avoid leaking the value of the key fields in situations where the data is considered sensitive

and therefore appears encrypted within the Data or DataFrag submessages.

(2) Enable the operation of infrastructure services without needed to leak to them the value of the

key fields (see 7.1.1.4).

Note that the use of the MD5 hashing function for these purposes does not introduce significant
vulnerabilities. While MD5 is considered broken as far as resistance to collisions (being able to find
two inputs that result in an identical unspecified hash) there are still no known practical preimage
attacks on MD5 (being able to find the input that resulted on a given hash).

7.3.5  Immutability of Publisher Partition Qos in combination with non-volatile

Durability kind

The DDS specification allows the PartitionQos policy of a Publisher to be changed after the
Publisher has been enabled. See sub clause 7.1.3 titled “Supported QoS) of the DDS 1.2
specification.

The DDS Security specification restricts this situation.

The DDS implementation shall not allow a Publisher to change PartitionQos policy after the
Publisher has been enabled if it contains any DataWriter that meets the following two criteria:
(1) The DataWriter either encrypts the SerializedPayload submessage element or

encrypts the Data or DataFrag submessage elements.

(2) The DataWriter has the DurabilityQos policy kind set to something other than

VOLATILE.

28

DDS Security, v1.1

This rule prevents data that was published while the DataWriter had associated a set of
Partitions from being sent to DataReaders that were not matching before the Partition
change and match after the Partition is changed.

7.3.6  Platform Independent Description

7.3.6.1  Change to the RTPS minor version number

Implementations of this specification shall set the RTPS protocol version number present in the RTPS
Header. The RTPS Major version number shall be set to 2 and the RTPS Minor version number shall
be set to 3. Future revisions of the DDS-RTPS specification shall take this fact into consideration.

7.3.6.2  RTPS Secure Submessage Elements

This specification introduces new RTPS SubmessageElements that may appear inside RTPS
Submessages.
7.3.6.2.1  CryptoTransformIdentifier

The CryptoTransformIdentifier submessage element identifies the kind of cryptographic
transformation that was performed in an RTPS Submessage or an RTPS SubmessageElement
and also provides a unique identifier of the key material used for the cryptographic transformation.

The way in which attributes in the CryptoTransformIdentifier are set shall be specified for
each Cryptographic plugin implementation. However, all Cryptographic plugin implementations shall
be set in a way that allows the operations preprocess_secure_submsg,
decode_datareader_submessage, decode_datawriter_submessage, and
decode_serialized_payload to uniquely recognize the cryptographic material they shall use
to decode the message, or recognize that they do not have the necessary key material.

7.3.6.2.2  CryptoContent

The CryptoContent submessage element is used to wrap a SerializedPayload, an RTPS
Submessage, or a complete RTPS Message. It is the result of applying one of the encoding
transformations on the CryptoTransform plugin.
The specific format of this shall be defined by each Cryptographic plugin implementation.
7.3.6.2.3  CryptoHeader

The CryptoHeader submessage element is used as prefix to wrap a SerializedPayload, an
RTPS Submessage, or a complete RTPS Message. It is the result of applying one of the encoding
transformations on the CryptoTransform plugin.
The CryptoHeader submessage element shall extend the CryptoTransformIdentifier
element. Consequently, the leading bytes in the CryptoHeader shall encode the
CryptoTransformIdentifier. Therefore, the transformationKind is guaranteed to be the first
element within the CryptoHeader. The specific format of this shall be defined by each
Cryptographic plugin implementation.

DDS Security, v1.1

29

7.3.6.2.4  CryptoFooter

The CryptoFooter submessage element is used as postfix to wrap a SerializedPayload, an
RTPS Submessage, or a complete RTPS Message. It is the result of applying one of the encoding
transformations on the CryptoTransform plugin.
The specific format of this shall be defined by each Cryptographic plugin implementation.

7.3.6.3  RTPS Submessage: SecureBodySubMsg

This specification introduces a new RTPS submessage: SecureBodySubMsg. The format of the
SecureBodySubMsg complies with the RTPS SubMessage format mandated in the RTPS
specification. It consists of the RTPS SubmessageHeader followed by a set of RTPS
SubmessageElement elements.
Since the SecureBodySubMsg conforms to the general structure of RTPS submessages, it can
appear inside a well-formed RTPS message.

7.4  DDS Support for Security Plugin Information Exchange

In order to perform their function, the security plugins associated with different DDS
DomainParticipant entities need to exchange information representing things such as Identity
and Permissions of the DomainParticipant entities, authentication challenge messages, tokens
representing key material, etc.

40

DDS Security, v1.1

DDS already has several mechanisms for information exchange between DomainParticipant
entities. Notably the builtin DataWriter and DataReader entities used by the Simple Discovery
Protocol (see sub clause 8.5 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]) and the
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantMessageReader (see sub clause 9.6.2.1 of the
DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]).

Where possible, this specification tries to reuse and extend existing DDS concepts and facilities so that
they can fulfill the needs of the security plugins, rather than defining entirely new ones. This way, the
Security Plugin implementation can be simplified and it does not have to implement a separate
messaging protocol.

7.4.1  Secure builtin Discovery Topics

7.4.1.1  Background (Non-Normative)

DDS discovery information is sent using builtin DDS DataReaders and DataWriters. These are
regular DDS DataReaders and DataWriters, except they are always present in the system and
their Topic names, associated data types, QoS, and RTPS EntityIds are all specified as part of the
DDS and RTPS specifications, so they do not need to be discovered.

The DDS specification defines three discovery builtin Topic entities: the DCPSParticipants used to
discover the presence of DomainParticipants, the DCPSPublications used to discover
DataWriters, and the DCPSSubscriptions used to discover DataReaders (see sub clause 8.5 of
the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]).

Much of the discovery information could be considered sensitive in secure DDS systems. Knowledge
of things like the Topic names that an application is publishing or subscribing to could reveal
sensitive information about the nature of the application. In addition, the integrity of the discovery
information needs to be protected against tampering, since it could cause erroneous behaviors or
malfunctions.

One possible approach to protecting discovery information would be to require that the discovery
builtin Topic entities always be protected via encryption and message authentication. However, this
would entail the problems explained below.

The DCPSParticipants builtin Topic is used to bootstrap the system, detect the presence of
DomainParticipant entities, and kick off subsequent information exchanges and handshakes. It
contains the bare minimum information needed to establish protocol communications (addresses, port
numbers, version number, vendor IDs, etc.). If this Topic were protected, the Secure DDS system
would have to create an alternative mechanism to bootstrap detection of other participants and gather
the same information—which needs to happen prior to being able to perform mutual authentication and
exchange of key material. This mechanism would, in essence, duplicate the information in the
DCPSParticipants builtin Topic. Therefore, it makes little sense to protect the DCPSParticipants
builtin Topic. A better approach is to augment the information sent using the DCPSParticipants
builtin Topic with any additional data the Secure DDS system needs for bootstrapping
communications (see 7.4.1.3).

Secure DDS systems need to co-exist in the same network and, in some cases, interoperate with non-
secure DDS systems. There may be systems built using implementations compliant with the DDS
Security specification, which do not need to protect their information. Or there may be systems
implemented with legacy DDS implementations that do not support DDS Security. In this situation, the

DDS Security, v1.1

41

fact that a secure DDS implementation is present on the network should not impact the otherwise
correct behavior of the non-secure DDS systems. In addition, even in secure systems not all Topics are
necessarily sensitive, so it is desirable to provide ways to configure a DDS Secure system to have
Topics that are “unprotected” and be able to communicate with non-secure DDS systems on those
“unprotected” Topics.

To allow co-existence and interoperability between secure DDS systems and DDS systems that do not
implement DDS security, secure DDS systems must retain the same builtin Topics as the regular DDS
systems (with the same GUIDs, topics names, QoS, and behavior). Therefore, to protect the discovery
and liveliness information of Topics that are considered sensitive, Secure DDS needs to use additional
builtin discovery Topics protected by the DDS security mechanisms.

7.4.1.2  Extending the Data Types used by DDS Discovery

The DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specifies the serialization of the data types used for the
discovery of builtin Topics (ParticipantBuiltinTopicData, PublicationBuiltinTopicData, and
SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData) using a representation called a ParameterList. Although this
description precedes the DDS-XTYPES specification, the serialization format matches the Extended
CDR representation defined in DDS-XTYPES for data types declared with MUTABLE extensibility.
This allows the data type associated with discovery topics to be extended without breaking
interoperability.

Given that DDS-XTYPES formalized the ParameterList serialization approach, first defined in the
DDS Interoperability and renamed it to “Extended CDR,” this specification will use the DDS
Extensible Types notation to define the data types associated with the builtin Topics. This does not
imply that compliance to the DDS-XTYPES is required to comply with DDS Security. All that is
required is to serialize the specific data types defined here according to the format described in the
DDS-XTYPES specification.

7.4.1.3  Reserved RTPS parameter IDs

This specification reserves the RTPS Simple Discovery Protocol ParameterIDs in the range: 0x1000 to
0x1FFF and 0x5000 to 0x5FFF.

The second interval covers the same range of parametersID, except they have the must-understand bit
set.

This reserved range applies to RTPS version 2.3 (see 7.3.6.1) and higher minor revisions of RTPS.
Future revisions of the DDS-RTPS specification shall take this fact into consideration.

7.4.1.4  Extension to RTPS Standard DCPSParticipants Builtin Topic

The DDS specification specifies the existence of the DCPSParticipants builtin Topic and a
corresponding builtin DataWriter and DataReader to communicate this Topic. These
endpoints are used to discover DomainParticipant entities.
The data type associated with the DCPSParticipants builtin Topic is ParticipantBuiltinTopicData,
defined in sub clause 7.1.5 of the DDS specification [1].

The DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specifies the serialization of ParticipantBuiltinTopicData.
The format used is what the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol calls a ParameterList whereby each
member of the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData is serialized using CDR but preceded in the stream by the
serialization of a short ParameterID identifying the member, followed by another short containing the

42

DDS Security, v1.1

length of the serialized member, followed by the serialized member. See sub clause 8.3.5.9 of the DDS
Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]. This serialization format allows the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData to
be extended without breaking interoperability.

This DDS Security specification adds several new members to the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData
structure. The member types and the ParameterIDs used for the serialization are described below.

   @id(0x1002) PermissionsToken  permissions_token;
   @id(0x1005) ParticipantSecurityInfo  security_info;
};

Only the Property_t and BinaryProperty_t elements having the propagate member set to
TRUE are serialized. Furthermore as indicated by the @non-serialized annotation the
serialization of the Property_t and BinaryProperty_t elements shall omit the serialization of
the propagate member. That is they are serialized as if the type definition did not contain the
propagate member. This is consistent with the data-type definition for Property_t specific in the DDS-
RTPS specification (see Table 9.12 of DDS-RTPS). Even if it is not present in the serialized data, the
receiver will set the propagate member to TRUE.

Note that according to DDS-RTPS the PID_PROPERTY_LIST is associated with a single
PropertySeq rather than the PropertyQosPolicy, which is a structure that contains two
sequences. This does not cause any interoperability problems because the containing
ParticipantBuiltinTopicData has mutable extensibility.
The DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specifies that the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData shall contain
the attribute called availableBuiltinEndpoints that is used to announce the builtin endpoints that are
available in the DomainParticipant. See clause 8.5.3.2 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol
[2]. The type for this attribute is an array of BuiltinEndpointSet_t. For the UDP/IP PSM the
BuiltinEndpointSet_t is mapped to a bitmap represented as type long. Each builtin endpoint is
represented as a bit in this bitmap with the bit values defined in Table 9.4 (clause 9.3.2) of the DDS
Interoperability Wire Protocol [2].

DDS Security, v1.1

This DDS Security specification reserves additional bits to indicate the presence of the corresponding
built-in end points listed in clause 7.4.5.  These bits shall be set on the availableBuiltinEndpoints. The
bit that encodes the presence of each individual endpoint is defined in Table 11 below.

7.4.1.5  Extension to RTPS Standard DCPSPublications and DCPSSubscriptions Builtin Topics

The DDS specification specifies the existence of the DCPSPublications and DCPSSubscriptions builtin
Topics and a corresponding builtin DataWriters and DataReaders to communicate these Topics.
These endpoints are used to discover DataWriter and DataReader entities.
The data type associated with the DCPSPublications and DCPSSubscriptions builtin Topic are
PublicationBuiltinTopicData and SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData, defined in sub clause 7.1.5 of the DDS
specification.

The DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specifies the serialization of PublicationBuiltinTopicData and
SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData.

The format used is what the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol calls a ParameterList whereby each
member of the PublicationBuiltinTopicData and SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData is serialized using CDR

44

DDS Security, v1.1

but preceded in the stream by the serialization of a short ParameterID identifying the member, followed by
another short containing the length of the serialized member, followed by the serialized member. See sub clause
8.3.5.9 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]. This serialization format allows the
PublicationBuiltinTopicData and SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData to be extended without breaking
interoperability.

This DDS Security specification adds a new member to the PublicationBuiltinTopicData and
SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData structure. The member types and the ParameterIDs used for the
serialization are described below.

7.4.1.6  New DCPSParticipantSecure Builtin Topic

As described in clause 7.4.1.4, the DCPSParticipants builtin Topic and a corresponding builtin
DataWriter and DataReader are used to discover DomainParticipant entities.
Implementations of the DDS Security shall use that same DCPSParticipants builtin Topic to
announce the DomainParticipant information. This is used for bootstrapping authentication and
allowing discovery of non-secure applications.

Implementations of the DDS Security specification shall have an additional builtin Topic referred to
as DCPSParticipantsSecure and associated builtin DataReader and DataWriter entities to
communicate the DomainParticipant information securely.
The Topic name for the DCPSParticipantsSecure Topic shall be “DCPSParticipantsSecure”.
The data type associated with the DCPSParticipantsSecure Topic shall be
ParticipantBuiltinTopicDataSecure, defined to be the same as the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData
defined in clause 7.4.1.4, except the structure has the additional optional member
identity_status_token with the ParameterId described below.

The QoS associated with the DCPSParticipantsSecure builtin Topic shall be the same as for the
DCPSPublications and DCPSSubscriptions builtin Topic. Note that is not the same as the
DCPSParticipants Topic. Among other differences, the DCPSParticipantsSecure has
ReliabilityQosPolicy kind set to RELIABLE.
The builtin DataWriter for the DCPSParticipantsSecure Topic shall be referred to as the
SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureWriter. The builtin DataReader for the DCPSParticipantsSecure
Topic shall be referred to as the SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureReader.
The RTPS EntityId_t associated with the SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureWriter and
SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureReader shall be as specified in 7.4.5.

The ParticipantBuiltinTopicData contains information, such as participant Locators, which may
change at run-time. These changes shall be sent using the DCPSParticipantsSecure builtin Topic.
The deletion of a DomainParticipant shall also be sent using the DCPSParticipantsSecure builtin
Topic.
After authentication has completed successfully a DomainParticipant shall ignore any changes
to the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData (including dispose messages) received on the DCPSParticipants
builtin Topic from the authenticated DomainParticipant. It may, however, rely on these
messages to maintain the liveliness of the remote DomainParticipant.  It should only process
ParticipantBuiltinTopicData messages containing data changes or status changes (dispose or
unregister) if they are received over the DCPSParticipantsSecure builtin Topic.

7.4.1.7  New DCPSPublicationsSecure Builtin Topic

The DDS specification specifies the existence of the DCPSPublications builtin Topic with topic
name “DCPSPublications” and corresponding builtin DataWriter and DataReader entities to
communicate on this Topic. These endpoints are used to discover non-builtin DataWriter entities.
The data type associated with the DCPSPublications Topic is PublicationBuiltinTopicData, defined
in sub clause 7.1.5 of the DDS specification.

Implementations of the DDS Security shall use that same DCPSPublications Topic to communicate
the DataWriter information for Topic entities that are not considered sensitive.
Implementations of the DDS Security specification shall have an additional builtin Topic referred to
as DCPSPublicationsSecure and associated builtin DataReader and DataWriter entities to
communicate the DataWriter information for Topic entities that are considered sensitive.
The determination of which Topic entities are considered sensitive shall be specified by the
AccessControl plugin.
The Topic name for the DCPSPublicationsSecure Topic shall be “DCPSPublicationsSecure”.
The data type associated with the DCPSPublicationsSecure Topic shall be
PublicationBuiltinTopicDataSecure, defined to be the same as the PublicationBuiltinTopicData

Topic shall be referred to as the SEDPbuiltinPublicationsSecureReader.
The RTPS EntityId_t associated with the SEDPbuiltinPublicationsSecureWriter and

7.4.1.8  New DCPSSubscriptionsSecure Builtin Topic

The DDS specification specifies the existence of the DCPSSubscriptions builtin Topic with Topic
name “DCPSSubscriptions” and corresponding builtin DataWriter and DataReader entities to
communicate on this Topic. These endpoints are used to discover non-builtin DataReader entities.
The data type associated with the DCPSSubscriptions is SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData is defined in
sub clause 7.1.5 of the DDS specification.

Implementations of the DDS Security specification shall use that same DCPSSubscriptions Topic to
send the DataReader information for Topic entities that are not considered sensitive. The
existence and configuration of Topic entities as non-sensitive shall be specified by the
AccessControl plugin.
Implementations of the DDS Security specification shall have an additional builtin Topic referred to
as DCPSSubscriptionsSecure and associated builtin DataReader and DataWriter entities to

Topic shall be referred to as the SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureReader.
The RTPS EntityId_t associated with the SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureWriter and
SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureReader shall be as specified in 7.4.5.

7.4.2  New DCPSParticipantMessageSecure builtin Topic

The DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specifies the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and
BuiltinParticipantMessageReader (see sub clauses 8.4.13 and 9.6.2.1 of the DDS Interoperability
Wire Protocol[2]). These entities are used to send information related to the LIVELINESS QoS. This
information could be considered sensitive and therefore secure DDS systems need to provide an
alternative protected way to send liveliness information.

The data type associated with these endpoints is ParticipantMessageData defined in sub clause 9.6.2.1
of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol specification [2].

To support coexistence and interoperability with non-secure DDS applications, implementations of the
DDS Security specification shall use the same standard BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and
BuiltinParticipantMessageReader to communicate liveliness information on Topic entities that are
not considered sensitive.

Implementations of the DDS Security specification shall have an additional
DCPSParticipantMessageSecure builtin Topic and associated builtin DataReader and
DataWriter entities to communicate the liveliness information for Topic entities that are
considered sensitive.

The data type associated with the DCPSParticipantMessageSecure Topic shall be the same as the
ParticipantMessageData structure.

The QoS associated with the DCPSParticipantMessageSecure Topic shall be the same as for the
DCPSParticipantMessage Topic as defined in sub clause 8.4.13 of the DDS Interoperability Wire
Protocol [2].

The builtin DataWriter for the DCPSParticipantMessageSecure Topic shall be referred to as the
BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureWriter. The builtin DataReader for the
DCPSParticipantMessageSecure Topic shall be referred to as the
BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureReader.

48

DDS Security, v1.1

The RTPS EntityId_t associated with the BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureWriter and
BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureReader shall be as specified in 7.4.5.

According to clause 8.7.2.2.3 of DDSI-RTPS [2], if the DataWriter LivelinessQos policy is
MANUAL_BY_TOPIC_LIVELINESS_QOS, liveliness is maintained sending data or heartbeats using
the same RTPS DataWriter. The remaining settings for the LivelinessQos policy use the
DCPSParticipantMessage Topic to maintain the DataWriter liveliness.
If a DataWriter LivelinessQos policy is MANUAL_BY_TOPIC_LIVELINESS_QOS,
implementations compliant with DDS-Security shall use the same RTPS DataWriter for the
liveliness heartbeats. The liveliness heartbeats shall be protected using the same means as the regular
DataWriter heartbeats. That is, according to the setting of the
EndpointSecurityAttributes is_submessage_protected attribute.
If the DataWriter LivelinessQos policy is AUTOMATIC_LIVELINESS_QOS or
MANUAL_BY_PARTICIPANT_LIVELINESS_QOS, implementations compliant with DDS-Security
shall send the liveliness heartbeats using either the DCPSParticipantMessage Topic or the
DCPSParticipantMessageSecure Topic. The selection shall be done according to the setting of the
TopicSecurityAttributes is_liveliness_protected: It shall use the DCPSParticipantMessage
Topic if is_liveliness_protected is set to false, otherwise it shall use the
DCPSParticipantMessageSecure Topic.

7.4.3  New DCPSParticipantStatelessMessage builtin Topic

To perform mutual authentication between DDS DomainParticipant entities, the security plugins
associated with those participants need to be able to send directed messages to each other. As described
in 7.4.3.1, the mechanisms provided by existing DDS builtin Topic entities are not adequate for this
purpose. For this reason, this specification introduces a new DCPSParticipantStatelessMessage builtin
Topic and corresponding builtin DataReader and DataWriter entities to read and write the
Topic.

7.4.3.1  Background: Sequence Number Attacks (non normative)

DDS has a builtin mechanism for participant-to-participant messaging: the
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantMessageReader (see sub clause 9.6.2.1 of the
DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]). However this mechanism cannot be used for mutual
authentication because it relies on the RTPS reliability protocol and suffers from the sequence-number
prediction vulnerability present in unsecured reliable protocols:

•  The RTPS reliable protocol allows a DataWriter to send to a DataReader Heartbeat

messages that advance the first available sequence number associated with the DataWriter. A
DataReader receiving a Heartbeat from a DataWriter will advance its first available
sequence number for that DataWriter and ignore any future messages it receives with sequence
numbers lower than the first available sequence number for the DataWriter. The reliable
DataReader will also ignore duplicate messages for that same sequence number.

•  The behavior of the reliability protocol would allow a malicious application to prevent other
applications from communicating by sending Heartbeats pretending to be from other
DomainParticipants that contain large values of the first available sequence number. All the
malicious application needs to do is learn the GUIDs of other applications, which can be done from

DDS Security, v1.1

49

observing the initial discovery messages on the wire, and use that information to create fake
Heartbeats.

Stated differently: prior to performing mutual authentication and key exchange, the applications cannot
rely on the use of encryption and message access codes to protect the integrity of the messages.
Therefore, during this time window, they are vulnerable to this kind of sequence-number attack. This
attack is present in most reliable protocols. Stream-oriented protocols such as TCP are also vulnerable
to sequence-number-prediction attacks but they make it more difficult by using a random initial
sequence number on each new connection and discarding messages with sequence numbers outside the
window. This is something that RTPS cannot do given the data-centric semantics of the protocol.

In order to avoid this vulnerability, the Security plugins must exchange messages using writers and
readers sufficiently robust to sequence number prediction attacks. The RTPS protocol specifies
endpoints that meet this requirement: the RTPS StatelessWriter and StatelessReader (see
8.4.7.2 and 8.4.10.2 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]) but there are no DDS builtin
endpoints that provide access to this underlying RTPS functionality.

7.4.3.2  BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader

The DDS Security specification defines two builtin Endpoints: the
BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader. These
two endpoints shall be present in compliant implementations of this specification. These endpoints are
used to write and read the builtin DCPSParticipantStatelessMessage Topic.
The BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter is an RTPS Best-Effort StatelessWriter (see sub
clause 8.4.7.2 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]).

The BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader is an RTPS Best-Effort StatelessReader (see
sub clause 8.4.10.2 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]).

The data type associated with these endpoints is ParticipantStatelessMessage defined
below (see also 7.2.5):

typedef ParticipantStatelessMessage ParticipantGenericMessage;

The RTPS EntityId_t associated with the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and
BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader shall be as specified in 7.4.5.

7.4.3.3  Contents of the ParticipantStatelessMessage

The ParticipantStatelessMessage is intended as a holder of information that is sent point-
to-point from a DomainParticipant to another.
The message_identity uniquely identifies each individual ParticipantStatelessMessage:
•  The source_guid field within the message_identity shall be set to match the GUID_t of the

BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter that writes the message.

•  The sequence_number field within the message_identity shall start with the value set to one and be
incremented for each different message sent by the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter.

The related_message_identity uniquely identifies another ParticipantStatelessMessage that
is related to the message being processed. It shall be set to either the tuple {GUID_UNKNOWN, 0} if

50

DDS Security, v1.1

the message is not related to any other message, or else set to match the message_identity of the
related ParticipantStatelessMessage.
The destination_participant_guid shall contain either the value GUID_UNKNOWN (see sub clause
9.3.1.5 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]) or else the GUID_t of the destination
DomainParticipant.
The destination_endpoint_guid provides a mechanism to specify finer granularity on the intended
recipient of a message beyond the granularity provided by the destination_participant_guid. It can
contain either GUID_UNKNOWN or else the GUID of a specific endpoint within destination
DomainParticipant. The targeted endpoint is the one whose Endpoint (DataWriter or
DataReader) GUID_t matches the destination_endpoint_guid.
The contents message_data depend on the value of the message_class_id and are defined in this
specification in the sub clause that introduces each one of the pre-defined values of the
GenericMessageClassId. See 7.4.3.5 and 7.4.3.6.

7.4.3.4  Destination of the ParticipantStatelessMessage

If the destination_participant_guid member is not set to GUID_UNKNOWN, the message written is
intended only for the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader belonging to the
DomainParticipant with a matching Participant Key.
This is equivalent to saying that the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader has an implied content
filter with the logical expression:

“destination_participant_guid == GUID_UNKNOWN

 || destination_participant_guid == BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader.participant.guid”

Implementations of the specification can use this content filter or some other mechanism as long as the
resulting behavior is equivalent to having this content filter.

If the destination_endpoint_guid member is not set to GUID_UNKNOWN, the message written
targets the specific endpoint within the destination DomainParticipant with a matching Endpoint
Key.

7.4.3.5  Reserved values of ParticipantStatelessMessage GenericMessageClassId

This specification, including future versions of this specification reserves GenericMessageClassId
values that start with the prefix “dds.sec.” (without quotes) .
The specification defines and uses the following specific values for the GenericMessageClassId:

#define GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_REQUEST            \
             “dds.sec.auth_request”
#define GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE            \
             “dds.sec.auth”

Additional values of the GenericMessageClassId may be defined with each plugin implementation.

7.4.3.6  Format of data within ParticipantStatelessMessage

Each value for the GenericMessageClassId uses different schema to store data within the
generic attributes in the message_data.

DDS Security, v1.1

51

7.4.3.6.1  Data for message class GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE

If GenericMessageClassId is GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE the
message_data attribute shall contain the HandshakeMessageTokenSeq containing one element.
The specific contents of the HandshakeMessageToken element shall be defined by the
Authentication Plugin.

The destination_participant_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the destination
DomainParticipant.
The destination_endpoint_guid shall be set to GUID_UNKNOWN. This indicates that there is no
specific endpoint targeted by this message: It is intended for the whole DomainParticipant.
The source_endpoint_guid shall be set to GUID_UNKNOWN.

7.4.3.6.2  Data for message class GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_REQUEST

If GenericMessageClassId is GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_REQUEST the message_data
attribute shall contain an AuthRequestMessageTokenSeq containing one element. The specific
contents of the AuthRequestMessageToken element shall be defined by the Authentication
Plugin.

The destination_participant_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the destination
DomainParticipant.
The destination_endpoint_guid shall be set to GUID_UNKNOWN. This indicates that there is no
specific endpoint targeted by this message: It is intended for the whole DomainParticipant.
The source_endpoint_guid shall be set to GUID_UNKNOWN.

7.4.4  New DCPSParticipantVolatileMessageSecure builtin Topic

7.4.4.1  Background (Non-Normative)

In order to perform key exchange between DDS DomainParticipant entities, the security plugins
associated with those participants need to be able to send directed messages to each other using a
reliable and secure channel. These messages are intended only for Participants that are currently in the
system and therefore need a DURABILITY Qos of kind VOLATILE.

The existing mechanisms provided by DDS are not adequate for this purpose:

•  The new DCPSParticipantStatelessMessage is not suitable because it is a stateless best-effort

channel not protected by the security mechanisms in this specification and therefore requires the
message data to be explicitly encrypted and signed prior to being given to the
ParticipantStatelessMessageWriter.

•  The new DCPSParticipantMessageSecure is not suitable because its QoS has DURABILITY kind
TRANSIENT_LOCAL (see sub clause 8.4.13 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2]) rather
than the required DURABILITY kind VOLATILE.

For this reason, implementations of the DDS Security specification shall have an additional builtin
Topic DCPSParticipantVolatileMessageSecure and corresponding builtin DataReader and
DataWriter entities to read and write the Topic.

DDS Security, v1.1

7.4.4.2  BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter and

BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader

The DDS Security specification defines two new builtin Endpoints: The
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter and the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader. These two endpoints shall be present in compliant
implementations of this specification. These endpoints are used to write and read the builtin
ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure Topic and shall have the TopicSecurityAttributes and
EndpointSecurityAttributes set as specified in the tables below.

The RTPS EntityId_t associated with the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter and
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader shall be as specified in 7.4.5.

7.4.4.3  Contents of the ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure

The ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure is intended as a holder of secure information that
is sent point-to-point from a DomainParticipant to another.
The destination_participant_guid shall contain either the value GUID_UNKNOWN (see sub clause
9.3.1.5 of the DDS Interoperability Wire Protocol [2] or else the GUID_t of the destination
DomainParticipant.
The message_identity uniquely identifies each individual
ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure:
•  The source_guid field within the message_identity shall be set to match the GUID_t of the

BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter that writes the message.

•  The sequence_number field within the message_identity shall start with the value set to one and be

incremented for each different message sent by the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter.

The related_message_identity uniquely identifies another
ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure that is related to the message being processed. It shall
be set to either the tuple {GUID_UNKNOWN, 0} if the message is not related to any other message, or
else set to match the message_identity of the related ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure.
The contents message_data depend on the value of the message_class_id and are defined in this
specification in the sub clause that introduces each one of the defined values of the
GenericMessageClassId, see 7.4.4.5.

7.4.4.4  Destination of the ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure

If the destination_participant_guid member is not set to GUID_UNKNOWN, the message written is
intended only for the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader belonging to the
DomainParticipant with a matching Participant Key.

54

DDS Security, v1.1

This is equivalent to saying that the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader has an implied
content filter with the logical expression:

      “destination_participant_guid == GUID_UNKNOWN

       || destination_participant_guid==BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader.participant.guid”

Implementations of the specification can use this content filter or some other mechanism as long as the
resulting behavior is equivalent to having this filter.

If the destination_endpoint_guid member is not set to GUID_UNKNOWN the message written targets
a specific endpoint within the destination DomainParticipant. The targeted endpoint is the one whose
Endpoint Key (DataWriter or DataReader GUID_t) matches the destination_endpoint_guid. This
attribute provides a mechanism to specify finer granularity on the intended recipient of a message
beyond the granularity provided by the destination_participant_guid.

7.4.4.5  Reserved values of ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure GenericMessageClassId

This specification, including future versions of this specification reserves GenericMessageClassId
values that start with the prefix “dds.sec.” (without the quotes) .
The specification defines and uses the following specific values for the GenericMessageClassId:

#define GMCLASSID_SECURITY_PARTICIPANT_CRYPTO_TOKENS \
             ”dds.sec.participant_crypto_tokens”
#define GMCLASSID_SECURITY_DATAWRITER_CRYPTO_TOKENS  \
             ”dds.sec.datawriter_crypto_tokens”
#define GMCLASSID_SECURITY_DATAREADER_CRYPTO_TOKENS  \
             ”dds.sec.datareader_crypto_tokens”

Additional values of the GenericMessageClassId may be defined with each plugin implementation.

7.4.4.6  Format of data within ParticipantVolatileMessageSecure

Each value for the GenericMessageClassId uses different schema to store data within the
generic attributes in the message_data.

7.4.4.6.1  Data for message class GMCLASS_SECURITY_PARTICIPANT_CRYPTO_TOKENS

If GenericMessageClassId is GMCLASSID_SECURITY_PARTICIPANT_CRYPTO_TOKENS,
the message_data attribute shall contain the ParticipantCryptoTokenSeq.
This message is intended to send cryptographic material from one DomainParticipant to another
when the cryptographic material applies to the whole DomainParticipant and not a specific
DataReader or DataWriter within.
The concrete contents of the ParticipantCryptoTokenSeq shall be defined by the
Cryptographic Plugin (CryptoKeyFactory).

The destination_participant_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the destination
DomainParticipant.
The destination_endpoint_guid shall be set to GUID_UNKNOWN. This indicates that there is no
specific endpoint targeted by this message: It is intended for the whole DomainParticipant.

DDS Security, v1.1

55

The source_endpoint_guid shall be set to GUID_UNKNOWN.

7.4.4.6.2  Data for message class GMCLASSID_SECURITY_DATAWRITER_CRYPTO_TOKENS

If GenericMessageClassId is GMCLASSID_SECURITY_DATAWRITER_CRYPTO_TOKENS,
the message_data shall contain the DatawriterCryptoTokenSeq.
This message is intended to send cryptographic material from one DataWriter to a DataReader
whom it wishes to send information to. The cryptographic material applies to a specific ‘sending’
DataWriter and it is constructed for a specific ‘receiving’ DataReader. This may be used to send
the crypto keys used by a DataWriter to encrypt data and sign the data it sends to a DataReader.
The concrete contents of the DatawriterCryptoTokenSeq shall be defined by the Cryptographic
Plugin (CryptoKeyFactory).

The destination_endpoint_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the DataReader that should receive
the CryptoToken values in the message.
The source_endpoint_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the DataWriter that will be using the
CryptoToken values to encode the data it sends to the DataReader.
7.4.4.6.3  Data for message class GMCLASSID_SECURITY_DATAREADER_CRYPTO_TOKENS

If GenericMessageClassId is GMCLASSID_SECURITY_DATAWRITER_CRYPTO_TOKENS,
the message_data attribute shall contain the DatareaderCryptoTokenSeq.
This message is intended to send cryptographic material from one DataReader to a DataWriter
whom it wishes to send information to. The cryptographic material applies to a specific ‘sending’
DataReader and it is constructed for a specific ‘receiving’ DataWriter. This may be used to send
the crypto keys used by a DataReader to encrypt data and sign the ACKNACK messages it sends to
a DataWriter.
The concrete contents of the DatareaderCryptoTokenSeq shall be defined by the Cryptographic
Plugin (CryptoKeyFactory).

The destination_endpoint_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the DataWriter that should receive
the CryptoToken values in the message.
The source_endpoint_guid shall be set to the GUID_t of the DataReader that will be using the
CryptoToken values to encode the data it sends to the DataWriter.

7.4.5  Definition of the “Builtin Secure Endpoints”

The complete list of builtin Endpoints that are protected by the security mechanism introduced in the
DDS Security specification is: SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureWriter,
SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureReader, SEDPbuiltinPublicationsSecureWriter,
SEDPbuiltinPublicationsSecureReader, SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureWriter,
SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureReader, BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureWriter,
BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureReader, BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter, and
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader.

This list shall be referred to as the builtin secure endpoints.

56

DDS Security, v1.1

7.4.6  Definition of the “Builtin Secure Discovery Endpoints”

The “builtin secure discovery endpoints” is the subset the builtin secure endpoints that are used for
discovery. They are: SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureWriter, SPDPbuiltinParticipantsSecureReader,
SEDPbuiltinPublicationsSecureWriter, SEDPbuiltinPublicationsSecureReader,
SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureWriter, and SEDPbuiltinSubscriptionsSecureReader.

This list shall be referred to as the builtin secure discovery endpoints.

7.4.7  Definition of the “Builtin Secure Liveliness Endpoints”

The “builtin secure liveliness endpoints” is the subset the builtin secure endpoints that are used for
managing automatic liveliness. They are: BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureWriter and
BuiltinParticipantMessageSecureReader.

This list shall be referred to as the builtin secure liveliness endpoints.

7.4.8  Securing the “Builtin Secure Endpoints”

As with application defined Topics, the middleware shall call the operations
get_datawriter_sec_attributes and get_datareader_sec_attributes on the
AccessControl interface to obtain the EndpointSecurityAttributes associated with
DataReader and DataWriter entities on all the “Builtin Secure Endpoints”. The specific values
of the EndpointSecurityAttributes shall be as shown in the Table below.

Table 21 – Purpose of each Security Plugin

Service Plugin

Purpose

Interactions

Authentication  Authenticate the principal that is joining a DDS

Domain.

Support mutual authentication between participants
and establish a shared secret.

The principal may be an
application/process or the user associated
with that application or process.

AccessControl  Decide whether a principal is allowed to perform a

protected operation.

Protected operations include joining a
specific DDS domain, creating a Topic,
reading a Topic, writing a Topic, etc.

Cryptography

Generate keys. Perform Key Exchange. Perform the
encryption and decryption operations. Compute
digests, compute and verify Message Authentication
Codes. Sign and verify signatures of messages.

This plugin implements 3 complementary
interfaces: CryptoKeyFactory,
CryptoKeyExchange, and
CryptoTransform.

Logging

Log all security relevant events.

This plugin is accessible to all other
plugins such that they can log the relevant
events.

DataTagging

Add a data tag for each data sample.

8.1.2  Plugin Instantiation

The Security Plugins shall be configurable separately for each DomainParticipant even when
multiple DomainParticipants are constructed within the same Operating System Process and share the
same Address Space.

A collection of the 5 SPIs intended to be used with the same DomainParticipant is referred to as
a DDS-Security Plugin Suite.

The mechanism used to instantiate the security Service Plugins and associate them with each
DomainParticipant is not defined by the DDS-Security specification.
Implementations of this specification may use vendor-specific configurations to facilitate linking the
Plugin Suite, including providing dynamic loading and linking facilities as well as initializing the
Plugin Suite.

Likewise implementations of this specification may use vendor-specific configurations to bind a Plugin
Suite to the DomainParticipant. However it is required for the Plugin Suite to be initialized and
bound by the time the DomainParticipant is enabled. Therefore this process shall complete either
during the DomainParticipantFactory create_domain_participant or else during the
DomainParticipant enable operations defined in [1]. Note that some of the Plugin Suite
Authentication and AccessControl operations shall also be called during
create_domain_participant or during enable.

8.3  Authentication Plugin

The Authentication Plugin SPI defines the types and operations necessary to support the authentication
of DDS DomainParticipants.

8.3.1  Background (Non-Normative)

Without the security enhancements, any DDS DomainParticipant is allowed to join a DDS
Domain without authenticating. However, in the case of a secure DDS system, every DDS participant
will be required to authenticate to avoid data contamination from unauthenticated participants.

The DDS protocol uses its native discovery mechanism to detect when participants enter the DDS
Domain.
The discovery mechanism that registers participants with the DDS middleware is enhanced with an
authentication protocol. For protected DDS Domains a DomainParticipant that enables the
authentication plugin will only communicate with another DomainParticipant that has the
authentication plugin enabled.

The plugin SPI is designed to support multiple implementations with varying numbers of message
exchanges. The message exchanges may be used by two DomainParticipant entities to challenge each
other so that their identity can be authenticated. Often a shared secret is also derived from a successful
authentication message exchange. The shared secret can be used to exchange cryptographic materal in
support of encryption and message authentication.

Figure 8 – Authentication plugin model

8.3.2.1

IdentityToken

An IdentityToken contains summary information on the identity of a DomainParticipant in
a manner that can be externalized and propagated via DDS discovery. The specific content of the
IdentityToken shall be defined by each Authentication plugin specialization. The intent is
to provide only summary information on the permissions or derived information such as a hash.

8.3.2.2

IdentityStatusToken

An IdentityStatusToken contains authentication information of a DomainParticipant in a
manner that can be externalized and propagated via the DCPSParticipantSecure builtin Topic. The
specific content of the IdentityStatusToken shall be defined by each Authentication
plugin. The intent is to provide a mechanism that can be used to securely send information to other
participants that are already mutually authenticated.  It could be used, for example, to provide an
updated certificate in case the current one has expired.

62

DDS Security, v1.1

The information shall be retrieved from the Authentication plugin by calling the operation
get_identity_status_token - and included in the DCPSParticipantSecure builtin Topic.
The Authentication plugin can use the operation on_status_changed on the
AuthenticationListener to notify that there is an updated IdentityStatusToken.

8.3.2.3

IdentityHandle

An IdentityHandle is an opaque local reference to internal state within the Authentication
plugin, which uniquely identifies a DomainParticipant. It is understood only by the
Authentication plugin and references the authentication state of the DomainParticipant.
This object is returned by the Authentication plugin as part of the validation of the identity of a
DomainParticipant and is used whenever a client of the Authentication plugin needs to
refer to the identity of a previously identified DomainParticipant.

8.3.2.4  HandshakeHandle

A HandshakeHandle is an opaque local reference used to refer to the internal state of a possible
mutual authentication or handshake protocol.

8.3.2.5  AuthRequestMessageToken

The AuthRequestMessageToken encodes plugin-specific information that the
Authentication plugins associated with two DomainParticipant entities exchange to
bootstrap the mutual authentication handshake. The AuthRequestMessageToken is understood
only by the AuthenticationPlugin implementations on either side of the handshake. The
AuthRequestMessageToken is sent and received by the DDS implementation under the direction
of the AuthenticationPlugins.
The AuthRequestMessageToken has class_id set to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_REQUEST (see 7.4.3.5).

8.3.2.6  HandshakeMessageToken

A HandshakeMessageToken encodes plugin-specific information that the Authentication plugins
associated with two DomainParticipant entities exchange as part of the mutual authentication
handshake. The HandshakeMessageToken is understood only by the
AuthenticationPlugin implementations on either side of the handshake. The
HandshakeMessageToken is sent and received by the DDS implementation under the direction of
the AuthenticationPlugins.
The HandshakeMessageToken has class_id set to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE (see 7.4.3.5).

8.3.2.7  AuthenticatedPeerCredentialToken

An AuthenticatedPeerCredentialToken encodes plugin-specific information that the
Authentication plugin obtains from a remote DomainParticipant during the authentication process that
is of interest to the AccessControlPlugin.  This information is accessible via the operation
get_authenticated_peer_credential_token.

DDS Security, v1.1

63

8.3.2.8  SharedSecretHandle

A SharedSecretHandle is an opaque local reference to internal state within the
AuthenticationPlugin containing a secret that is shared between the
AuthenticationPlugin implementation and the peer AuthenticationPlugin
implementation associated with a remote DomainParticipant. It is understood only by the two
AuthenticationPlugin implementations that share the secret. The shared secret is used to
encode Tokens, such as the CryptoToken, such that they can be exchanged between the two
DomainParticipants in a secure manner.

8.3.2.9  Authentication

This interface is the starting point for all the security mechanisms. When a DomainParticipant
is either locally created or discovered, it needs to be authenticated in order to be able to communicate
in a DDS Domain.
The interaction between the DDS implementation and the Authentication plugin has been designed in a
flexible manner so it is possible to support various authentication mechanisms, including those that
require a handshake and/or perform mutual authentication between participants. It also supports
establishing a shared secret. This interaction is described in the state machine illustrated in the figure
below.

8.3.2.9.1  Reliability of the Authentication Handshake

In order to be sufficiently robust to avert sequence number attacks (7.4.3.1), the Authentication
Handshake uses the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and
BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader endpoints (7.4.3) with GenericMessageClassId set
to GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_REQUEST or
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE (7.4.3.5). These stateless endpoints send
messages best-effort without paying attention to any sequence number information to remove
duplicates or attempt ordered delivery. Despite this, the Authentication Handshake needs to be able to
withstand the message loss that may occur on the network.

In order to operate robustly in the presence of message loss and sequence number attacks DDS
Security implementations shall follow the rules below:

1.  The DDS security implementation shall pass to the AuthenticationPlugin any message received
by the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader that has a GenericMessageClassId
set to GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_REQUEST or
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE.

2.  Any time the state-machine indicates that a message shall be sent using the

BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and a reply message needs to be received by the
BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader, the DDS implementation shall cache the message
that was sent and set a timer. If a correct reply message is not received when the timer expires,
the state-machine shall send the same message again. This process shall be repeated multiple
times until a correct message is received.

3.  Whenever a message is sent using the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter, a reply
message is received by the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader. The reply is then
passed to the AuthenticationPlugin. If the plugin operation returns VALIDATION_NOT_OK,
the implementation transitions back to the previous state that caused the message to be sent and
resends the same message.

Rule #2 makes authentication robust to message loss.

Rule #3 makes authentication robust to an attacker trying to disrupt an authentication exchange by
sending bad replies.

Example application of rule #2: Assume the DDS implementation transitioned to the
HandshakeMessageSend state, sent the message M1 and is now in the HandshakeMessageWait state
waiting for the reply. If no reply is received within an implementation-specific retry-time, the same
message M1 shall be sent again and the process repeated until either a reply is received or an
implementation-specific timeout elapses (or a maximum number of retries is reached).

Example application of rule #3: Assume the DDS implementation transitioned to the
HandshakeMessageSend state, sent the message M2, transitions to HandshakeMessageWait, receives
the reply, transitions to HandshakeMessageReceived, calls process_handshake() and the operation
returns VALIDATION_NOT_OK. In this situation the DDS implementation shall transition back to
HandshakeMessageSend and resent M2 again.

8.3.2.10  Unauthenticated DomainParticipant entities

The term “Unauthenticated” DomainParticipant entity refers to a discovered
DomainParticipant that cannot be authenticated by the Authentication plugin. This can be either

66

because they lack support for the Authentication plugin being used, have incompatible plugins,

ValidationResult_t

Indicates the validation has succeeded
Indicates the validation has failed
Indicates that validation is still proceeding. The operation shall be
retried at a later point in time.
Indicates that validation of the submitted IdentityToken requires
sending a handshake message. The DDS Implementation shall call the
operation begin_handshake_request and send the
HandshakeMessageToken obtained from this call using the
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter with
GenericMessageClassId set to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE.
Indicates that validation is still pending. The DDS Implementation
shall wait for a message on the BuiltinParticipantMessageReader
and, once this is received, call process_handshake to pass the
information received in that message.
Indicates that validation has succeeded but the DDS Implementation
shall send a final message using the
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter with
GenericMessageClassId set to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE.

8.3.2.11.2  Operation: validate_local_identity
Validates the identity of the local DomainParticipant. The operation returns as an output
parameter the IdentityHandle, which can be used to locally identify the local Participant to the
Authentication Plugin.
In addition to validating the identity, this operation also returns the DomainParticipant GUID_t
that shall be used by the DDS implementation to uniquely identify the DomainParticipant on the
network.

This operation shall be called before the DomainParticipant is enabled. It shall be called either
by the implementation of DomainParticipantFactory create_domain_participant or
DomainParticipant enable [1].
If an error occurs, this method shall return VALIDATION_FAILED and fill the
SecurityException.

70

DDS Security, v1.1

The method shall return either VALIDATION_OK if the validation succeeds, or
VALIDATION_FAILED if it fails, or VALIDATION_PENDING_RETRY if the verification has not
finished.

If VALIDATION_PENDING_RETRY has been returned, the operation shall be called again after a
configurable delay to check the status of verification. This shall continue until the operation returns
either VALIDATION_OK (if the validation succeeds), or VALIDATION_FAILED. This approach
allows non-blocking interactions with services whose verification may require invoking remote
services.

Parameter (out) local_identity_handle: A handle that can be used to locally refer to the
Authenticated Participant in subsequent interactions with the Authentication plugin. The nature
of the handle is specific to each Authentication plugin implementation. The handle will only be
meaningful if the operation returns VALIDATION_OK.

Parameter (out) adjusted_participant_guid: The GUID_t that the DDS implementation shall use to
uniquely identify the DomainParticipant on the network. The returned
adjusted_participant_guid shall be the one that eventually appears in the participant_guid attribute of
the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData sent via discovery.
Parameter domain_id: The DDS Domain Id of the DomainParticipant.
Parameter participant_qos: The DomainParticipantQos of the DomainParticipant.
Parameter candidate_participant_guid: The GUID_t that the DDS implementation would have
used to uniquely identify the DomainParticipant if the Security plugins were not enabled.
Parameter exception: A SecurityException object.
Return: The operation shall return

•  VALIDATION_OK if the validation was successful.
•  VALIDATION_FAILED if it failed.
•  VALIDATION_PENDING_RETRY if verification has not completed and the operation should be

retried later.

8.3.2.11.3  Operation: validate_remote_identity
Initiates the process of validating the identity of the discovered remote DomainParticipant,
represented as an IdentityToken object. The operation returns the ValidationResult_t
indicating whether the validation succeeded, failed, or is pending a handshake. If the validation
succeeds, an IdentityHandle object is returned, which can be used to locally identify the remote
DomainParticipant to the Authentication plugin.
If the validation can be performed with the information passed and succeeds, the operation shall return
VALIDATION_OK. If it can be performed with the information passed and it fails, it shall return
VALIDATION_FAILED.
The validation of a remote participant might require the remote participant to perform a handshake. In
this situation, the validate_remote_identity operation shall return
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST or
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE.

DDS Security, v1.1

71

If the operation returns VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST, then the DDS
implementation shall call the operation begin_handshake_request to continue the validation
process.

If the operation returns VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE, then the DDS
implementation shall wait until it receives a ParticipantStatelessMessage from the remote
participant identified by the remote_participant_guid using the contents described in 8.3.2.11.5 and
then call the operation begin_handshake_reply.
If an error occurs, this method shall return VALIDATION_FAILED and fill the
SecurityException.
Parameter (out) remote_identity_handle: A handle that can be used to locally refer to the remote
Authenticated Participant in subsequent interactions with the AuthenticationPlugin. The nature
of the remote_identity_handle is specific to each AuthenticationPlugin implementation. The
handle will only be provided if the operation returns something other than VALIDATION_FAILED.

Parameter (out) local_auth_request_token: An AuthRequestMessageToken to be sent using
the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter. The contents shall be specified by each plugin
implementation. If the returned token is TokenNIL (see 7.2.4.3), the
AuthRequestMessageToken shall not be sent.
Parameter remote_auth_request_token: The AuthRequestMessageToken received from the
remote DomainParticipant that caused the authentication to begin. This token shall be NIL if the
authentication was not initiated by the reception of an AuthRequestMessageToken.
Parameter remote_identity_token: A token received as part of
ParticipantBuiltinTopicData, representing the identity of the remote
DomainParticipant.
Parameter remote_participant_guid: GUID_t uniquely identifying the remote participant.
Parameter exception: A SecurityException object.

Return: The operation shall return:

•  VALIDATION_OK if the validation was successful.
•  VALIDATION_FAILED if it failed.
•  VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST if validation has not completed. If this is
returned, the DDS implementation shall call begin_handshake_request, to continue the
validation.

•  VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE if validation has not completed. If this is

returned, the DDS implementation shall wait for a message on the
BuiltinParticipantMessageReader with the message_identity containing a source_guid that
matches the remote_participant_guid and a message_class_id set to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE.

•  VALIDATION_PENDING RETRY if the validation has not completed. If this is returned, the

operation should be called again at a later point in time to check the validation status.

72

•  VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE if validation has not completed. If this is

returned, the DDS implementation shall send the handshake_message_out using the
BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter and then wait for the reply message on the
BuiltinParticipantMessageReader. The DDS implementation shall set the
ParticipantStatelessMessage participantGuidPrefix message_class_id to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_AUTH_HANDSHAKE and fill the message_data with the
handshake_message HandshakeMessageToken and set the destination_participant_guid to
match the DDS GUID_t of the destination DomainParticipant. When the reply message is
received the DDS implementation shall call the operation begin_handshake_reply, to
continue the validation.

information on the changed status and propagate it to other DomainParticipant entities. The
actions that shall be taken for each kind of status are described in clause 8.3.2.12.1 .

8.4  Access Control Plugin

The Access Control Plugin API defines the types and operations necessary to support an access control
mechanism for DDS DomainParticipants.

8.4.1  Background (Non-Normative)

Once a DomainParticipant is authenticated, its permissions need to be validated and enforced.
Permissions or access rights are often described using an access control matrix where the rows are
subjects (i.e., users), the columns are objects (i.e., resources), and a cell defines the access rights that a
given subject has over a resource. Typical implementations provide either a column-centric view (i.e.,
access control lists) or a row-centric view (i.e., a set of capabilities stored with each subject). With the
proposed AccessControl SPI, both approaches can be supported.
Before we can describe the access control plugin SPI, we need to define the permissions that can be
attached to a DomainParticipant. Every DDS application uses a DomainParticipant to
access or produce information on a Domain; hence the DomainParticipant has to be allowed to
run in a certain Domain. Moreover, a DomainParticipant is responsible for creating

DDS Security, v1.1

81

DataReaders and DataWriters that communicate over a certain Topic. Hence, a
DomainParticipant has to have the permissions needed to create a Topic, to publish through its
DataWriters certain Topics, and to subscribe via its DataReaders to certain Topics. There
is a very strong relationship between the AccessControl plugin and the Cryptographic plugin
because encryption keys need to be generated for DataWriters based on the
DomainParticipant’s permissions.

AccessControlPlugin specialization. The intent is to provide only summary information on the
permissions or derived information such as a hash.

8.4.2.2  PermissionsCredentialToken

A PermissionsCredentialToken encodes the permissions and access information for a
DomainParticipant in a manner that can be externalized and sent over the network. The
PermissionsCredential is used by the AccessControl plugin to verify the permissions of a
peer DomainParticipant and perform all the access-control decisions related to that peer
DomainParticipant, including determining whether it can join a domain, match specific local
DataWriters or DataReaders, etc.
The PermissionsCredentialToken is intended for dissemination during the authentication
handshake. The specific content of the PermissionsCredentialToken shall be defined by each
AccessControl plugin specialization and it may not be used by some AccessControl plugin
specializations.

8.4.2.3  PermissionsHandle

A PermissionsHandle is an opaque local reference to internal state within the AccessControl
plugin. It is understood only by the AccessControl plugin and characterizes the permissions
associated with a specific DomainParticipant. This object is returned by the AccessControl
plugin as part of the validation of the permissions of a DomainParticipant and is used whenever
a client of the AccessControl plugin needs to refer to the permissions of a previously validated
DomainParticipant.

8.4.2.4  ParticipantSecurityAttributes

The ParticipantSecurityAttributes describe how the middleware should protect the
DomainParticipant. This is a structured type whose members are described in the table below.

8.5  Cryptographic Plugin

The Cryptographic plugin defines the types and operations necessary to support encryption,
digest, message authentication codes, and key exchange for DDS DomainParticipants,
DataWriters and DDS DataReaders.
Users of DDS may have specific cryptographic libraries they use for encryption, as well as, specific
requirements regarding the algorithms for digests, message authentication, and signing. In addition,
applications may require having only some of those functions performed, or performed only for certain
DDS Topics and not for others. Therefore, the plugin API has to be general enough to allow flexible
configuration and deployment scenarios.

8.5.1  Cryptographic Plugin Model

8.5.1.1  CryptoToken

This class represents a generic holder for key material. A CryptoToken object contains all the
information necessary to construct a set of keys to be used to encrypt and/or sign plain text
transforming it into cipher-text or to reverse those operations.

The format and interpretation of the CryptoToken depends on the implementation of the
Cryptographic plugin. Each plugin implementation shall fully define itself, so that applications are able
to interoperate. In general, the CryptoToken will contain one or more keys and any other necessary
material to perform crypto-transformation and/or verification, such as, initialization vectors (IVs),
salts, etc.

8.5.1.2  ParticipantCryptoHandle

The ParticipantCryptoHandle object is an opaque local reference that represents the key
material used to encrypt and sign whole RTPS Messages. It is used by the operations
encode_rtps_message and decode_rtps_message.

8.5.1.3  DatawriterCryptoHandle

The DatawriterCryptoHandle object is an opaque local reference that represents the key
material used to encrypt and sign RTPS submessages sent from a DataWriter. This includes the RTPS
submessages Data, DataFrag, Gap, Heartbeat, and HeartbeatFrag, as well as, the
SerializedPayload submessage element that appears in the Data and DataFrag submessages.
It is used by the operations encode_datawriter_submessage,
decode_datawriter_submessage, encode_serialized_payload, and
decode_serialized_payload.

8.5.1.4  DatareaderCryptoHandle

The DatareaderCryptoHandle object is an opaque local reference that represents the key
material used to encrypt and sign RTPS Submessages sent from a DataReader. This includes the
RTPS Submessages AckNack and NackFrag.
It is used by the operations encode_datareader_submessage,
decode_datareader_submessage.

8.5.1.5  CryptoTransformIdentifier

The CryptoTransformIdentifier object used to uniquely identify the transformation applied
on the sending side (encoding) so that the receiver can locate the necessary key material to perform the
inverse transformation (decoding). The generation of CryptoTransformIdentifier is
performed by the Cryptographic plugin.
To enable interoperability and avoid misinterpretation of the key material, the structure of the
CryptoTransformIdentifier is defined for all Cryptographic plugin implementations as
follows:

typedef octet CryptoTransformKind[4];
typedef octet CryptoTransformKeyId[4];
struct CryptoTransformIdentifier {
    CryptoTransformKind   transformation_kind;

108

.
specification, including future versions of this specification.

Implementers can use the transformation_kind attribute to identify non-standard cryptographic
transformations. In order to avoid collisions, the first two octets in the transformation_kind
shall be set to a registered RTPS VendorId [36]. The RTPS VendorId used shall either be one
reserved to the implementer of the Cryptographic Plugin, or else the implementer of the
Cryptographic Plugin shall secure permission from the registered owner of the RTPS
VendorId to use it.
8.5.1.5.2  Attribute: transformation_key_id

Uniquely identifies the key material used to perform a cryptographic transformation within the scope
of all Cryptographic Plugin transformations performed by the DDS DomainParticipant that
creates the key material.

In combination with the sending DomainParticipant GUID, the transformation_key_id
attribute allows the receiver to select the proper key material to decrypt/verify a message that has been
encrypted and/or signed. The use of this attribute allows a receiver to be robust to dynamic changes in
keys and key material in the sense that it can identify the correct key or at least detect that it does not
have the necessary keys and key material.

The values of the transformation_key_id are defined by the Cryptographic plugin
implementation and understood only by that plugin.

signing of both the data written by DDS applications and the RTPS submessage and message headers,
used to implement the discovery protocol, distribute the DDS data, implement the reliability protocol,
etc.

8.5.1.8.1  Operation: create_local_participant_crypto_tokens

This operation creates a sequence of CryptoToken tokens containing the information needed to
correctly interpret cipher text encoded using the local_participant_crypto. That is, the CryptoToken
sequence contains the information needed to decrypt any data encrypted using the
local_participant_crypto, as well as, verify any signatures produced using the
local_participant_crypto.

The returned CryptoToken sequence contains opaque data, which only the plugins understand. The
returned CryptoToken sequence is intended for transmission in “clear text” to the remote
DomainParticipant associated with the remote_participant_crypto so that the remote
DomainParticipant has access to the necessary key material. For this reason, the
CryptoKeyExchange plugin implementation may encrypt the sensitive information inside the
CryptoToken using shared secrets and keys obtained from the remote_participant_crypto. The
specific ways in which this is done depend on the plugin implementation.

The DDS middleware implementation shall call this operation for each remote
DomainParticipant that matches a local DomainParticipant. That is, remote participants
that have been successfully authenticated and granted access by the AccessControl plugin. The
returned ParticipantCryptoTokenSeq shall be sent to the remote DomainParticipant
using the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter with kind set to
GMCLASSID_SECURITY_PARTICIPANT_CRYPTO_TOKENS (see 7.4.3.5). The returned
ParticipantCryptoTokenSeq sequence shall appear in the message_data attribute of the

The returned CryptoToken sequence contains opaque data, which only the plugins understand. The
returned CryptoToken sequence shall be sent to the remote DataReader associated with the
remote_datareader_crypto so that the remote DataReader has access to the necessary key
material.

The operation shall take into consideration the value of the relay_only parameter associated with the
DatawriterCryptoHandle (see 8.5.1.7.4) this parameter shall control whether the Tokens
returned contain all the cryptographic material needed to decode/verify both the RTPS SubMessage
and the CryptoContent submessage element within or just part of it.

If the value of the relay_only parameter was FALSE, the Tokens returned contain all the cryptographic
material.

If the value of the relay_only parameter was TRUE, the Tokens returned contain only the
cryptographic material needed to verify and decode the RTPS SubMessage but not the CryptoContent
submessage element within.

8.5.1.9  CryptoTransform interface

This interface groups the operations related to encrypting/decrypting, as well as, computing and
verifying both message digests (hashes) and Message Authentication Codes (MAC).

MACs may be used to verify both the (data) integrity and the authenticity of a message. The
computation of a MAC (also known as a keyed cryptographic hash function), takes as input a secret
key and an arbitrary-length message to be authenticated, and outputs a MAC. The MAC value protects
both a message's data integrity, as well as, its authenticity by allowing verifiers (who also possess the
secret key) to detect any changes to the message content.

A Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is a specialized way to compute MACs. While
an implementation of the plugin is not forced to use HMAC, and could use other MAC algorithms, the
API is chosen such that plugins can implement HMAC if they so choose.

The operations in the CryptoTransform Plugin are defined to be quite generic, taking an input
byte array to transform and producing the transformed array of bytes as an output. The DDS
implementation is only responsible for calling the operations in the CryptoTransform plugin at the
appropriate times as it generates and processes the RTPS messages, substitutes the input bytes with the
transformed bytes produced by the CryptoTransform operations, and proceeds to generate/send or
process the RTPS message as normal but with the replaced bytes. The decision of the kind of
transformation to perform (encrypt and/or produce a digest and/or a MAC and/or signature) is left to
the plugin implementation.

This operation shall be called by the DDS implementation as a result of the application calling the
write operation on the DataWriter associated with the DatawriterCryptoHandle specified in the
sending_datawriter_crypto parameter.

The operation receives the data written by the DataWriter in serialized form wrapped inside the
RTPS SerializedPayload submessage element and shall output an RTPS CryptoContent
submessage element and a extra_inline_qos containing InlineQos formatted as a ParameterList,
see section 7.3.1.

If the returned extra_inline_qos is not empty, the parameters contained shall be added to the list of
inlineQos parameters present in the (Data or DataFrag) submessage. If the (Data or DataFrag)
submessage did not already have an inlineQos, then the inlineQos submessage element shall be added
and the submessage flags modified accordingly.

The DDS implementation shall call this operation for all outgoing RTPS Submessages with
submessage kind Data and DataFrag. The DDS implementation shall substitute the
SerializedPayload submessage element within the aforementioned RTPS submessages with the
CryptoContent produced by this operation.
The implementation of encode_serialized_payload can perform any desired cryptographic
transformation of the SerializedPayload using the key material in the
sending_datawriter_crypto, including encryption, addition of a MAC, and/or signature. The
encode_serialized_payload shall include in the extra_inline_qos or the CryptoContent
the CryptoTransformIdentifier and the additional information needed to identify the key
used and decode the CryptoContent submessage element.
If an error occurs, this method shall return false.

The operation receives the DatawriterCryptoHandle of the DataWriter that is sending the
submessage, as well as, a list of DatareaderCryptoHandle corresponding to all the
DataReader entities to which the submessage is being sent.
In the case of BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter (identified through the
DatawriterCryptoHandle), the DatareaderCryptoHandle list has ONE element
containing KxKey material derived from the SharedSecret as described in 9.5.2.1.2.
The operation receives the complete RTPS submessage as it would normally go onto the wire in the
parameter rtps_submessage and shall output one or more RTPS Submessages in the output
parameter encoded_rtps_submessage. The DDS implementation shall substitute the original RTPS
submessage that was passed in the rtps_submessage with the RTPS Submessages returned in the
encoded_rtps_submessage output parameter in the construction of the RTPS message that is
eventually sent to the intended recipients.

The implementation of encode_datawriter_submessage can perform any desired
cryptographic transformation of the RTPS Submessage using the key material in the
sending_datawriter_crypto; it can also add one or more MACs and/or signatures. The fact that the
cryptographic material associated with the list of intended DataReader entities is passed in the
parameter receiving_datareader_crypto_list allows the plugin implementation to include MACs that
may be computed differently for each DataReader.
The implementation of encode_datawriter_submessage shall include, within the RTPS
Submessages, the CryptoTransformIdentifier containing any additional information
necessary for the receiving plugin to identify the DatawriterCryptoHandle associated with the
DataWriter that sent the message, as well as, the DatareaderCryptoHandle associated with the
DataReader that is meant to process the submessage. How this is done depends on the plugin
implementation.

plain_rtps_submessage, iterating over elements in the receiving_datawriter_crypto_list. Each iteration
prepares the encoded_rtps_submessage for a different set of data readers and advances the
receiving_datareader_crypto_list_index.

The receiving_datareader_crypto_list_index shall be set to 0 to start the iteration on a
plain_rtps_submessage. Subsequent calls may use a non-zero value of the index. If the index is non-
zero, then the plain_rtps_submessage shall be set to the empty sequence and the
encoded_rtps_submessage shall be the one returned by a previous call to the
encode_datawriter_submessage. The calls with non-zero values of the

of a call to encode_datawriter_submessage or a call to
encode_datareader_submessage, and to retrieve the appropriate
DatawriterCryptoHandle and DatareaderCryptoHandle needed to decode the
submessage.

If the operation returns successfully, the DDS implementation shall call the appropriate decode
operation based on the returned SecureSubmessageCategory_t:
•  If the returned SecureSubmessageCategory_t equals DATAWRITER_SUBMESSAGE,

then the DDS Implementation shall call decode_datawriter_submessage.

•  If the returned SecureSubmessageCategory_t equals DATAREADER_SUBMESSAGE,

then the DDS Implementation shall call decode_datareader_submessage.

•  If the returned SecureSubmessageCategory_t equals INFO_SUBMESSAGE, then the DDS

Implementation proceeds normally to process the submessage without further decoding.

Parameter secure_submessage_category: Output SecureSubmessageCategory_t. It shall be
set to DATAWRITER_SUBMESSAGE if the SecurePrefixSubMsg was created by a call to
encode_datawriter_submessage or set to DATAREADER_SUBMESSAGE if the

8.6  The Logging Plugin

The Logging Control Plugin API defines the types and operations necessary to support logging of
security events for a DDS DomainParticipant.

8.6.1  Background (Non-Normative)

The Logging plugin provides the capability to log all security events, including expected behavior
and all security violations or errors. The goal is to create security logs that can be used to support
audits. The rest of the security plugins will use the logging API to log events.

The Logging plugin will add an ID to the log message that uniquely specifies the
DomainParticipant. It will also add a time-stamp to each log message.

140

DDS Security, v1.1

The Logging API has two options for collecting log data. The first is to log all events to a local file
for collection and storage. The second is to distribute log events securely over DDS.

8.6.2.1  LogOptions

The LogOptions let the user control the log level and where to log. The options must be set before
logging starts and may not be changed at run-time after logging has commenced. This is to ensure that
an attacker cannot temporarily suspend logging while they violate security rules, and then start it up
again.

The options specify if the messages should be logged to a file and, if so, the file name. The
LogOptions also specify whether the log messages should be distributed to remote services or only
kept locally.

8.7  Data Tagging

Data tagging is the ability to add a security label or tag to data. This is often used to specify a
classification level of the data including information about its releasability. In a DDS context, it could
have several uses:

•

•

•

It can be used for access control – access control would be granted based on the tag.

It could be used for message prioritization.

It could not be used by the middleware, and instead used by the application or other service.

8.7.1  Background (Non-Normative)

There are four different approaches to data tagging:

1.  DataWriter tagging: data received from a certain DataWriter has the tag of the

DataWriter. This solution does not require the tag to be added to each individual sample.
2.  Data instance tagging: each instance of the data has a tag. This solution does not require the tag to

be added to each individual sample.

3.  Individual sample tagging: every DDS sample has its own tag attached.
4.  Per-field sample tagging: very complex management of the tags.

This specification supports DataWriter tagging. This was considered the best choice as it meets the
majority of use cases. It fits into the DDS paradigm, as the metadata for all samples from a
DataWriter is the same. It is also the highest performance, as the tag only needs to be exchanged
once when the DataWriter is discovered, not sent with each sample.
This approach directly supports typical use cases where each application or DomainParticipant
writes data on a Topic with a common set of tags (e.g., all at the same specified security level). For
use cases where an application creates data at different classifications, that application can create
multiple DataWriters with different tags.

8.7.2  DataTagging Model

The DataWriter tag will be associated with every sample written by the DataWriter. The
DataWriter DataTag is implemented as an immutable DataWriterQos. The DataWriter
DataTag shall be propagated in the PublicationBuiltinTopicData as part of the DDS
discovery protocol.

The DataReader DataTag is implemented as an immutable DataReaderQos. The DataReader
DataTag shall be propagated in the SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData as part of the DDS
discovery protocol.

8.8  Security Plugins Behavior

In the previous sub clauses, the functionality and APIs of each plugin have been described. This sub
clause provides additional information on how the plugins are integrated with the middleware.

8.8.1  Authentication and AccessControl behavior with local DomainParticipant

DomainParticipant.

In this sub clause the term “DDS application” refers to the application code that calls the DDS API.
The term “DDS middleware” refers to a DDS Implementation that complies with the DDS Security
specification.

Figure 21 – Authentication and AccessControl sequence diagram with local DomainParticipant

This behavior sequence is triggered when the DDS application initiates the creation of a local
DomainParticipant by calling the create_participant operation on the
DomainParticipantFactory. The following are mandatory steps that the DDS middleware
shall perform prior to creating the DomainParticipant. The steps need not occur exactly as
described as long as the observable behavior matches the one described below.

The DDS middleware shall validate the identity of the application attempting to create the
DomainParticipant by calling the Authentication::validate_local_identity
operation, passing the domain_id, the DomainParticipantQos, and a
candidate_participant_guid. The Authentication plugin validates the identity of the local
DomainParticipant and returns an IdentityHandle for the holder of the identity
(DomainParticipant), which will be necessary for interacting with the access control plugin. The
validate_local_identity operation also returns an adjusted_participant_guid. If the identity
is not successfully validated, the DDS middleware shall not create the DomainParticipant and

146

DDS Security, v1.1

the create_participant operation shall return NIL and set the return code to
NOT_ALLOWED_BY_SECURITY.

1.  The DDS middleware shall validate that the DDS application has the necessary permissions

to join DDS domains by calling the
AccessControl::validate_local_permissions operation. The Access
Control plugin shall validate the permissions and issue a signed PermissionsHandle
for the holder of the identity (DomainParticipant). If the permissions are not
validated, the DomainParticipant shall not be created, the create_participant
operation shall return NIL and set the return code to NOT_ALLOWED_BY_SECURITY.

2.  The DDS middleware shall verify that the DDS application has the necessary permissions

to join the specific Domain identified by the domainId by calling the operation
AccessControl::check_create_participant. If this operation returns FALSE,
the DomainParticipant shall not be created, the create_participant operation
shall return NIL and set the return code to NOT_ALLOWED_BY_SECURITY.

3.  The DDS middleware shall call the get_identity_token operation to obtain the
IdentityToken object corresponding to the received IdentityHandle. The
IdentityToken object shall be placed in the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData sent via
discovery, see 7.4.1.3.

4.  The DDS middleware shall call the get_identity_status_token operation to

obtain the IdentityStatusToken object corresponding to the received
IdentityHandle. If the returned IdentityStatusToken object is different than
TokenNIL, it shall be placed in the ParticipantBuiltinTopicDataSecure sent via secure
discovery, see 7.4.1.6.

5.  The middleware shall call the get_permissions_token operation on the

AccessControl plugin to obtain the PermissionsToken object corresponding to the
received PermissionsHandle. The PermissionsToken shall be placed in the
ParticipantBuiltinTopicData sent via discovery, see 7.4.1.3.

6.  The middleware calls the get_permissions_credential_token operation on the
AccessControl plugin, which returns the PermissionsCredentialToken object
corresponding to the received PermissionsHandle. The
PermissionsCredentialToken object is necessary to configure the
Authentication plugin.

7.  The middleware calls the set_permissions_credential_and_token operation
on the Authentication plugin such that it can be sent during the authentication
handshake.

8.  The middleware calls the get_participant_sec_attributes operation on the
AccessControl plugin to obtain the ParticipantSecurityAttributes such
that it knows how to handle remote participants that fail to authenticate.

9.  The DomainParticipant’s IdentityToken, and PermissionsToken are used
to configure DDS discovery such that they are propagated inside the identity_token and the
permissions_token members of the ParticipantBuiltinTopicData. The
DomainParticipant’s IdentityStatusToken, is used to configure DDS

DDS Security, v1.1

147

discovery such that it is propagated inside the identity_status_token member of the
ParticipantBuiltinTopicDataSecure. This operation is internal to the DDS implementation
and therefore this API is not specified by the DDS Security specification. It is mentioned
here to provide guidance to implementers.

8.8.2  Authentication behavior with discovered DomainParticipant

Depending on the ParticipantSecurityAttributes returned by the AccessControl
operation get_participant_sec_attributes the DomainParticipant may allow
remote DomainParticipants that lack the ability to authenticate (e.g., do not implement DDS
Security) to match.

8.8.2.1  Behavior when allow_unauthenticated_participants is set to TRUE
If the ParticipantSecurityAttributes returned by the operation
get_participant_sec_attributes has the member
allow_unauthenticated_participants set to TRUE, the DomainParticipant shall
allow matching remote DomainParticipant entities that are not able to authenticate. Specifically:
•  Discovered DomainParticipant entities that do not implement the DDS Security specification

or do not contain compatible Security Plugins shall be matched without the
DomainParticipant attempting to authenticate them and shall be treated as “Unauthenticated”
DomainParticipant entities.

•  Discovered DomainParticipant entities that do implement the DDS Security specification and
declare compatible Security Plugins but fail the Authentication protocol shall be matched and
treated as “Unauthenticated” DomainParticipants entities.
For any matched “Unauthenticated” DomainParticipant entities, the DomainParticipant
shall match only the regular builtin Endpoints (ParticipantMessage, DCPSParticipants,
DCPSPublications, DCPSSubscriptions) and not the builtin secure Endpoints (see 7.4.5 for the
complete list).

For any matched authenticated DomainParticipant entities, the DomainParticipant
shall match all the builtin endpoints.

8.8.2.2  Behavior when allow_unauthenticated_participants is set to FALSE
If the ParticipantSecurityAttributes has the member
allow_unauthenticated_participants set to FALSE, the DomainParticipant shall
reject remote DomainParticipant entities that are not able to authenticate. Specifically:
•  Discovered DomainParticipant entities that do not implement the DDS Security specification

or do not contain compatible Security Plugins shall be rejected without the
DomainParticipant attempting to authenticate them.

•  Discovered DomainParticipant entities that do implement the DDS Security specification,

declare compatible Security Plugins but fail the Authentication protocol shall be rejected.

•  Discovered DomainParticipant entities that do implement the DDS Security specification and
declare compatible Security Plugins automatically "match" the ParticipantStatelessMessage builtin
endpoints to allow the authentication handshake to proceed.

148

DDS Security, v1.1

•  Discovered DomainParticipant entities that do implement the DDS Security specification,
declare compatible Security Plugins, and pass the Authentication protocol successfully shall be
matched and the DomainParticipant shall also match all the builtin endpoints of the
discovered DomainParticipant, except for the ParticipantStatelessMessage builtin endpoints,
which were already matched prior to the Authentication protocol.

The figure below illustrates the behavior of the security plugins with regards to a discovered
DomainParticipant that also implements the DDS Security specification and announces
compatible security plugins. The exact operations depend on the plugin implementations. The
sequence diagram shown below is just indicative of one possible sequence of events and matches what
the builtin DDS:Auth:PKI-DH plugin (see 9.3.3) does.

1.  Participant2 discovers Participant1via the discovery protocol. The

BuiltinParticipantTopicData contains the IdentityToken and
PermissionsToken of Participant1.

2.  Participant2 calls the validate_remote_identity operation to validate the identity
of Participant1 passing the local IdentityHandle of Participant2 and the remote
IdentityToken and GUID_t of Participant1 received via discovery and obtains an
IdentityHandle for Participant1, needed for further operations involving Participant1.
The operation returns VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE indicating
that further handshake messages are needed to complete the validation and that Participant2

DDS Security, v1.1

149

should wait for a HandshakeMessageToken to be received from Participant1.
Participant2 waits for this message.

3.  Participant1 discovers Participant2 via the DDS discovery protocol. The

BuiltinParticipantTopicData contains the IdentityToken and
PermissionsToken of Participant2.

4.  Participant1 calls the operation validate_remote_identity to validate the identity
of Participant2 passing the IdentityToken and PermissionsToken of Participant2
received via discovery and obtains an IdentityHandle for Participant2, needed for
further operations involving Participant2. The operation returns
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST indicating further handshake
messages are needed and Participant1 should initiate the handshake.

5.  Participant1 calls begin_handshake_request to begin the requested handshake. The

operation outputs a HandshakeHandle and a HandshakeMessageToken
(messageToken1). The operation returns
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE indicating authentication is not
complete and the returned messageToken1 needs to be sent to Participant2 and a reply
should be expected.

6.  Participant1 sends the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken1) to Participant2

using the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter.

7.  Participant2 receives the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken1) on the

BuiltinParticipantMessageReader. Participant2 determines the message originated from a
remote DomainParticipant (Participant1) for which it had already called
validate_remote_identity where the function had returned
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REPLY.

8.  Participant2 calls begin_handshake_reply passing the received

HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken1). The Authentication plugin
processes the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken1) and outputs a
HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken2) in response and a HandshakeHandle.
The operation begin_handshake_reply returns
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE, indicating authentication is not
complete and an additional message needs to be received.

9.  Participant2 sends the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken2) back to

Participant1 using the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter.

10. Participant1 receives the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken2) on the

BuiltinParticipantMessageReader. Participant1 determines this message originated from a
remote DomainParticipant (Participant2) for which it had already called
validate_remote_identity where the function had returned
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST.

11. Participant1 calls process_handshake passing the received

HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken2). The Authentication plugin processes
messageToken2, verifies it is a valid reply to the messageToken1 it had sent and outputs the
HandshakeMessageToken messageToken3 in response. The process_handshake

150

DDS Security, v1.1

operation returns VALIDATION_OK_FINAL_MESSAGE, indicating authentication is
complete but the returned HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken3) must be sent to
Participant2.

12. Participant1 sends the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken3) to Participant2

using the BuiltinParticipantMessageWriter.

13. Participant2 receives the HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken3) on the

BuiltinParticipantMessageReader. Participant2 determines this message originated from a
remote DomainParticipant (Participant1) for which it had already called the
operation begin_handshake_reply where the call had returned
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE.

14. Participant2 calls the process_handshake operation, passing the received

HandshakeMessageToken (messageToken3). The Authentication plugin processes the
messageToken2, verifies it is a valid reply to the messageToken2 it had sent and returns
OK, indicating authentication is complete and no more messages need to be sent or
received.

15. Participant1, having completed the authentication of Participant2, calls the operation

get_shared_secret to retrieve the SharedSecret, which is used with the other
Plugins to create Tokens to exchange with Participant2.

16. Participant1, having completed the authentication of Participant2, calls the operation

get_authenticated_peer_credential_token to retrieve the
AuthenticatedPeerCredentialToken associated with Participant2, which is
used with the AccessControl plugin to determine the permissions that Participant1 will
grant to Participant2.

17. Participant2, having completed the authentication of Participant1, calls the operation

get_shared_secret to retrieve the SharedSecret, which is used with the other
Plugins to create Tokens to exchange with Participant1.

18. Participant2, having completed the Authentication of Participant1, calls the operation

get_authenticated_peer_credential_token to retrieve the
AuthenticatedPeerCredentialToken associated with Participant2 which is used
with the AccessControl plugins to determine the permissions that Participant2 will
grant to Participant1.

8.8.3  DDS Entities impacted by the AccessControl operations

There are six types of DDS Entities: DomainParticipant, Topic, Publisher,
Subscriber, DataReader, and DataWriter.  All these except the DomainParticipant are
defined as the DDS Domain Entities (subclause 2.2.2.1.2 of DDS [1]).
The Domain Entities created by a DomainParticipant can be grouped into four categories:
1.  DDS-RTPS Protocol [2] Builtin Entities. These are domain entities used to read and write the four

builtin Topics: DCPSParticipants, DCPSTopics, DCPSPublications, DCPSSubscriptions.

2.  Builtin Secure Entities. These are the Domain Entities related to the Builtin Secure

Endpoints defined in Section 7.4.5. These Entities are used to read and write the four builtin

DDS Security, v1.1

151

secure topics: DCPSPublicationsSecure, DCPSSubscriptionsSecure,
DCPSParticipantMessageSecure, and DCPSParticipantVolatileMessageSecure.

3.  Other builtin Entities defined by the DDS-Security specification not included in the “Builtin

Secure Endpoints”. These are the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and the
BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader.

4.  Application-defined Entities. These are any non-builtin Domain Entities.
The AccessControl plugin shall impact only the Builtin Secure Entities and the application-
defined Entities. It shall not impact the builtin entities defined by the DDS-RTPS Protocol
specification nor the BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter or the
BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader.

AccessControl plugin operations can be grouped into 5 groups:
1.  Group1. Operations related to DomainParticipant. These are: validate_local_permissions,

validate_remote_permissions, check_create_participant, get_permissions_token,
get_permissions_credential_token, set_listener, return_permissions_token,
return_permissions_credential_token, get_participant_sec_attributes,
return_participant_sec_attributes.

2.  Group2. Operations related to the creation of local Domain Entities. These are:

check_create_topic, check_create_datawriter, check_create_datareader,
get_datawriter_sec_attributes, get_datareader_sec_attributes, return_datawriter_sec_attributes,
return_datareader_sec_attributes.

3.  Group3. Operations related to write activities of local Domain Entities. These are:
check_local_datawriter_register_instance and check_local_datawriter_dispose_instance.

4.  Group4. Operations related to discovery and match of remote Domain Entities. These are:

check_remote_topic, check_remote_datawriter, check_remote_datareader,
check_local_datawriter_match, and check_local_datareader_match.

5.  Group5. Operations related to the write activities of remote Domain Entities. These are:
check_remote_datawriter_register_instance and check_remote_datawriter_dispose_instance.

Table 42 below summarizes the DDS Entities affected by each operation group.

The DomainParticipant entities are only impacted by AccessControl plugin operations in
Group1. The DomainParticipant is not created unless allowed by the AccessControl plugin.
Also the matching of a remote DomainParticipant must be allowed by the AccessControl
plugin. The full interaction is described in sub clauses 8.8.1 and 8.8.6.

The DDS-RTPS Builtin Entities are impacted indirectly by AccessControl plugin operations in
Group1 in the sense that if the sense that the creation of the Entities is dependent on the successful
creation of the local DomainParticipant which is controlled by the Group1 operations. Likewise
the match of the remote entities is dependent on the successful match of a remote
DomainParticipant, which is also controlled by the Group1 operations.
The DDS-RTPS Builtin Entities shall not be impacted by any of the operations in Group2, Group3,
Group4, or Group5.

The Secure Builtin Entities are impacted indirectly by AccessControl plugin operations in Group1
in the same way as the DDS-RTPS Builtin Entities.

The Secure Builtin Entities are impacted only by the get_datawriter_sec_attributes and
get_datareader_sec_attributes operations in Group2. They shall not be impacted by any
other Group2 operations. This means that the Secure Builtin Entities shall be created unconditionally

DDS Security, v1.1

153

when the DomainParticipant is created. During the creation process of DataWriter entities the
get_datawriter_sec_attributes shall be called and likewise during the creation process of
DataReader entities the get_datareader_sec_attributes shall be called. The purpose of
calling these get_xxx_sec_attributes operations is to obtain the information necessary to call
the Cryptographic plugin operations on these endpoints.

The BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageWriter and BuiltinParticipantStatelessMessageReader are
only indirectly impacted by the Group2 operations in that they are tied to the successful creation of the
DomainParticipant. They are not impacted by the successful match of remote entities not any
other AccessControl plugin operations in any Group. DDS Secure implementations shall create
these endpoints unconditionally for all created DomainParticipant.  Being stateless these
endpoints are not “matched” to remote endpoints in the sense of being aware and maintaining the state
and presence of the remote endpoints.  Nevertheless they are able to send exchange information in a
stateless, best-efforts manner.

The Application-defined Publisher and Subscriber Entities are impacted indirectly by
AccessControl plugin operations in Group1 only by the fact that they depend on the successful
creation of the DomainParticipant.  They are impacted indirectly by operations in Group2 by the
fact that the PartitionQos settings of the Publisher (or Subscriber) may cause the
AccessControl plugin to prevent the creation of DataWriter (or DataReader) entities
belonging to them. Likewise they are impacted indirectly by operations in Group4 in that the
PartitionQos settings of the remote Publisher (or Subscriber) may cause the
AccessControl plugin to prevent matching of remote DataWriter (or DataReader)
entities. They are not impacted by operations in Group3 or Group5.

The Application-defined Topic, DataWriter and DataReader entities are impacted indirectly by
AccessControl plugin operations in Group1 the same way the The DDS-RTPS Builtin Entities are.
These Entities are impacted by the AccessControl plugin operations in Group2, Group3,
Group4, and Group5. This is described in subclauses 8.8.5 and 8.8.7.

8.8.4  AccessControl behavior with local participant creation

The functionality of the AccesControl plugin with regards to the creation of local DDS
DomainParticipant entities was illustrated in Figure 21 and described in 8.8.1. Subclause 8.8.1
covered Authentication and AccessControl plugin behavior simultanepusly because these
two plugins interact with each other.

8.8.5  AccessControl behavior with local domain entity creation

1.  The DDS application initiates the creation of a new Topic for the

DomainParticipant.

2.  The middleware calls AccessControl::get_topic_sec_attributes to obtain

the TopicSecurityAttributes for the Topic being created.

3.  The middleware verifies the DomainParticipant is allowed to create a Topic with
name topicName. Operation AccessControl::check_create_topic() is
called for this verification. If the verification fails, the Topic object is not created.

4.  The DDS application initiates the creation of a local DataWriter.
5.  The middleware verifies that the DataWriter has the right permissions to publish on

Topic topicName. Operation AccessControl::check_create_datawriter()
is called for this verification. As an optional behavior, check_create_datawriter ()
can also verify if the DataWriter is allowed to tag data with dataTag. If the
verification doesn’t succeed, the DataWriter is not created. As an optional behavior,
check_create_datawriter() can also check the QoS associated with the
DataWriter and grant permissions taking that into consideration.

DDS Security, v1.1

155

6.  The middleware calls AccessControl::get_datawriter_sec_attributes to

obtain the EndpointSecurityAttributes for the created DataWriter.

7.  This sequence diagram illustrates the situation where the TopicSecurityAttributes
for the created DataWriter has the is_discovery_protected attribute set to FALSE. In this
situation the middleware configures Discovery to use regular (not secure) publications
discovery endpoint (DCPSPublications) to propagate the
PublicationBuiltinTopicData for the created DataWriter.

8.  The DDS application initiates the creation of a local DataReader.
9.  The middleware verifies that the DataReader has the right permissions to subscribe on

Topic topicName. Operation AccessControl::check_create_datareader()
is called for this verification. As an optional behavior, check_create_datareader()
can also verify if the DataReader is allowed to receive data tagged with dataTag. If
the verification doesn’t succeed, the DataReader is not created. As an optional behavior
check_create_datareader() can also check the QoS associated with the
DataReader and grant permissions taking that into consideration.

10. The middleware calls the operation

AccessControl::get_datareader_sec_attributes to obtain the
EndpointSecurityAttributes for the created DataReader entity.

11. This sequence diagram illustrates the situation where the TopicSecurityAttributes
for the topic (a different topic than in the earlier steps) has the is_discovery_protected
attribute set to TRUE. In this situation the middleware configures Discovery to use the
secure subscriptions discovery endpoint (DCPSSecureSubscriptions) to propagate the
SubscriptionBuiltinTopicData for the created DataReader.

12. The DDS application initiates the registration of a data instance on the DataWriter.
13. The middleware verifies that the DataWriter has the right permissions to register the

instance. The operation
AccessControl::check_local_datawriter_register_instance() is
called for this verification. If the verification doesn’t succeed, the instance is not registered.

14. The DDS application initiates the disposal of an instance of the DataWriter.
15. The middleware verifies that the DataWriter has the right permissions to dispose the

instance. The operation
AccessControl::check_local_datawriter_dispose_instance() is
called for this verification. If the verification doesn’t succeed, the instance is not disposed.

8.8.6  AccessControl behavior with remote participant discovery

If the ParticipantSecurityAttributes object returned by the AccessControl operation
get_participant_sec_attributes has the allow_unauthenticated_participants attribute set
to TRUE, the DomainParticipant may discover DomainParticipants that cannot be authenticated
because they either lack support for the authentication protocol or they fail the authentication protocol.
These “Unauthenticated” DomainParticipant entities shall be matched and considered
“Unauthenticated” DomainParticipant entities. Local DomainParticipant will not perform any

156

DDS Security, v1.1

further participant AccessControl validation with unauthenticated participants (i.e.,
validate_remote_permissions and check_remote_participant will not be called).
If the DomainParticipant discovers a DomainParticipant entity that it can authenticate
successfully, and is_access_protected is TRUE, then it shall validate with the AccessControl plugin
that it has the permissions necessary to join the DDS domain. This is done by successfully calling to
get_authenticated_peer_credential_token on the Authentication plugin, then to
validate_remote_permissions and check_remote_participant in the
AccessControl plugin:
•  If the validation succeeds, the discovered DomainParticipant shall be considered “Authenticated”

and all the builtin Topics automatically matched.

•  If the validation fails, the discovered DomainParticipant shall be considered ignored and all the

builtin Topics should not be matched.

If the DomainParticipant discovers a DomainParticipant entity that it can authenticate
successfully, and is_access_protected is FALSE, then validation will succeed with no access control
checking. In this case, only get_authenticated_peer_credential_token and
validate_remote_permissions are called, and a HandleNIL return will not impact the
validation result.

The figure below illustrates the functionality of the security plugins with regards to the discovery of
remote DomainParticipant entity that has been successfully authenticated by the Authentication
plugin.

1.  The DomainParticipant Participant1 discovers the DomainParticipant

(Participant2) via the discovery protocol and successfully authenticates Participant2 and
obtains the AuthenticatedPeerCredentialToken as described in 8.8.2.
2.  Participant1 calls the operation validate_remote_permissions to validate the
permissions of Participant2, passing the PermissionsToken obtained via discovery
from Participant2 and the AuthenticatedPeerCredentialToken returned by the

DDS Security, v1.1

157

operation get_authenticated_peer_credential_token on the
Authentication plugin. The operation validate_remote_permissions returns
a PermissionsHandle, which the middleware will use whenever an access control
decision must be made for the remote DomainParticipant.

3.  Participant1 calls the operation check_remote_participant to verify the remote
DomainParticipant (Participant2) is allowed to join the DDS domain with the
specified domainId, passing the PermissionsHandle returned by the
validate_remote_permissions operation. If the verification fails, the remote
DomainParticipant is ignored and all the endpoints corresponding to the builtin
Topics are unmatched.

4.  Participant1 discovers that DomainParticipant (Participant2) has created a new DDS

Topic.

5.  Participant1 verifies that the remote DomainParticipant (Participant2) has the
permissions needed to create a DDS Topic with name topicName. The operation
check_remote_topic is called for this verification. If the verification fails, the
discovered Topic is ignored.

8.8.7  AccessControl behavior with remote domain entity discovery

This sub clause describes the functionality of the AccessControl plugin relative to the discovery of
remote domain entities, that is, Topic, DataWriter, and DataReader entities.
If the ParticipantSecurityAttributes object returned by the AccessControl operation
get_participant_sec_attributes has the is_access_protected attribute set to
FALSE, the DomainParticipant may have matched a remote “Unauthenticated”
DomainParticipant, i.e., a DomainParticipant that has not authenticated successfully and
may therefore discover endpoints via the regular (non-secure) discovery endpoints from an
“Unauthenticated” DomainParticipant.

8.8.7.1  AccessControl behavior with discovered endpoints from “Unauthenticated” DomainParticipant

If the DomainParticipant discovers endpoints from an “Unauthenticated”
DomainParticipant it shall:
•  Reject (do not try to match) local endpoints for which the related TopicSecurityAttributes

have the attribute is_read_protected or is_write_protected set to TRUE.

•  Proceed to try matching without checking with the AccessControl plugin the local

DataWriter endpoints for which the related TopicSecurityAttributes object returned
by the operation get_topic_sec_attributes have the attribute is_read_protected set to

8.8.7.2  AccessControl behavior with discovered endpoints from “Authenticated” DomainParticipant

If the DomainParticipant discovers endpoints from an “authenticated” DomainParticipant
it shall:

•  Perform the AccessControl checks for discovered endpoints that would match local

DataWriters for whom the is_read_protected attribute is set to TRUE, and only proceed to try
matching the discovered endpoints for whom the access control checks succeed.

•  Perform the AccessControl checks for discovered endpoints that would match local

DataReader for whom the is_write_protected attribute is set to TRUE, and only proceed to try
matching the discovered endpoints for whom the access control checks succeed.

•  Proceed to try matching without checking with the AccessControl plugin the local

DataWriters for whom the related TopicSecurityAttributes object returned by the
operation get_topic_sec_attributes has the is_read_protected attribute set to FALSE.

•  Proceed to try matching without checking with the AccessControl plugin the local

DataReaders for whom the related TopicSecurityAttributes object returned by the
operation get_topic_sec_attributes has the is_write_protected attribute set to FALSE.

8.8.8  Cryptographic Plugin key generation behavior

Key Generation is potentially needed for:

•  The DomainParticipant as a whole
•  Each DomainParticipant match pair
•  Each builtin secure endpoint (DataWriter or DataReader)
•  Each builtin secure endpoint match pair
•  Each application secure endpoint (DataWriter or DataReader)
•  Each application secure endpoint match pair

8.8.8.1  Key generation for the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter and

BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader

The BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter and
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader endpoints are special in that they are the ones used
to securely send the Crypto Tokens. Therefore the key material needed to secure this channel has to be
derivable from the SharedSecret without having access to Crypto Tokens returned by the
create_local_datawriter_crypto_tokens or
create_local_datareader_crypto_tokens. Effectively this means the key material used
for key-exchange is always derived from the SharedSecret.
For the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter the creation of the key material necessary to
communicate with a matched BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader shall complete during
the operation register_matched_remote_datareader and the DDS middleware shall not
call the operation create_local_datawriter_crypto_tokens or the operation
set_remote_datareader_crypto_tokens on the CryptoKeyExchange.

162

DDS Security, v1.1

For the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader the creation of the key material necessary to
communicate with a matched BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter shall complete during
the operation register_matched_remote_datawriter and the DDS middleware shall not
call the operation create_local_datareader_crypto_tokens or the operation
set_remote_datawriter_crypto_tokens on the CryptoKeyExchange.
The DDS implementation shall add a property with name “dds.sec.builtin_endpoint_name” and
value “BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter” to the Property_t passed to the operation
register_local_datawriter when it registers the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter with the CryptoKeyFactory.

The DDS implementation shall add a property with name “dds.sec.builtin_endpoint_name” and
value “BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader” to the Property_t passed to the operation
register_local_datareader when it registers the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader with the CryptoKeyFactory.

Setting the Property_t as described above allows the CryptoKeyFactory to recognize the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter and the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader.

8.8.8.2  Key generation for the DomainParticipant

For each local DomainParticipant that is successfully created the DDS implementation shall call
the operation register_local_participant on the KeyFactory.
For each discovered DomainParticipant that has successfully authenticated and has been
matched to the local DomainParticipant the DDS middleware shall call the operation
register_matched_remote_participant on the KeyFactory. Note that this operation
takes as one parameter the SharedSecret obtained from the Authentication plugin.

8.8.8.3  Key generation for the builtin endpoints

For each DataWriter belonging to the list of “Builtin Secure Endpoints”, see 7.4.5, with the
exception of the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter, the DDS middleware shall call the
operation register_local_datawriter on the KeyFactory to obtain the
DatawriterCryptoHandle for the builtin DataWriter.
For each DataReader belonging to the list of “Builtin Secure Endpoints”, see 7.4.5, with the
exception of the BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader, the DDS middleware shall call the
operation register_local_datareader on the KeyFactory to obtain the
DatareaderCryptoHandle for the corresponding builtin DataReader.
For each discovered DomainParticipant that has successfully authenticated and has been
matched to the local DomainParticipant the DDS middleware shall:

1.  Call the operation KeyFactory::register_matched_remote_datawriter for each

local DataWriter belonging to the “Builtin Secure Endpoints” passing it the local
DataWriter and the corresponding remote DataReader belonging to the “Builtin Secure
Endpoints” of the discovered DomainParticipant.

2.  Call the operation KeyFactory::register_matched_remote_datareader for each

local DataReader belonging to the “Builtin Secure Endpoints” passing it the local

DDS Security, v1.1

163

DataReader , the corresponding remote DataWriter belonging to the “Builtin Secure
Endpoints” of the discovered DomainParticipant, and the SharedSecret obtained
from the Authentication plugin.

8.8.8.4  Key generation for the application-defined endpoints

Recall that for each application-defined (non-builtin) DataWriter and DataReader successfully
created by the DDS Application the DDS middleware has an associated
EndpointSecurityAttributes object which is the one returned by the
AccessControl::get_datawriter_sec_attributes or
AccessControl::get_datareader_sec_attributes.
For each non-builtin DataWriter for whom the associated EndpointSecurityAttributes
object has either the member is_submessage_protected or the member is_payload_protected set to
TRUE, the DDS middleware shall:

1.  Call the operation register_local_datawriter on the KeyFactory to obtain the

DatawriterCryptoHandle for the DataWriter.

2.  Call the operation register_matched_remote_datareader for each discovered

DataReader that matches the DataWriter.

For each non-builtin DataReader for whom the associated EndpointSecurityAttributes
object has either the member is_submessage_protected or the member is_payload_protected set to
TRUE, the DDS middleware shall:

1.  Call the operation register_local_datareader on the KeyFactory to obtain the

DatareaderCryptoHandle for the DataReader.

2.  Call the operation register_matched_remote_datawriter for each discovered

DataWriter that matches the DataReader.

8.8.8.5  Limiting message-size overhead caused by receiver specific key material

The use of receiver-specific key material increases the message size in situations where the same
encoded message is sent to multiple receivers. For example, when using a multicast transport. In the
presence of large numbers or receivers this "per-receiver" overhead may cause a single RTPS
submessage with all the receiver-specific authentication codes to exceed the maximum transport MTU.
This would cause problems, as RTPS submessages cannot be fragmented.

To overcome this kind of situation implementations may use different strategies.

1.  An implementation may limit the number of different receiver-specific key material it

generates. For example, it may reuse the same receiver-specific key for multiple receivers. This
would limit the overhead at the cost of weakening the origin authentication.

2.  An implementation may impose a limit on the number of receiver-specific macs attached to a

single message. This would require DDS implementations to construct multiple messages, each
with a different set of receiver-specific authentication codes. This use-case is facilitated by the
encode_datawriter_submessage and encode_rtps_message CryptoTransform operations.

The selection between and configuration of these choices is implementation specific, as it does not
affect interoperability.

8.8.9  Cryptographic Plugin key exchange behavior

Cryptographic key exchange is potentially needed for:

•  Each DomainParticipant match pair.
•  Each builtin secure endpoint match pair.
•  Each application secure endpoint match pair.

8.8.9.1  Key Exchange with discovered DomainParticipant

Cryptographic key exchange shall occur between each DomainParticipant and each discovered
DomainParticipant that has successfully authenticated. This key exchange propagates the key
material related to encoding/signing/decoding/verifying the whole RTPS message. In other words the
key material needed to support the CryptoTransform operations encode_rtps_message and
decode_rtps_message.
Given a local DomainParticipant the DDS middleware shall:

1.  Call the operation create_local_participant_crypto_tokens on the
KeyFactory for each discovered DomainParticipant that has successfully
authenticated and has been matched to the local DomainParticipant. This operation takes
as parameters the local and remote ParticipantCryptoHandle.
2.  Send the ParticipantCryptoTokenSeq returned by operation

create_local_participant_crypto_tokens to the discovered
DomainParticipant using BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureWriter.

The discovered DomainParticipant shall call the operation
set_remote_participant_crypto_tokens passing the
ParticipantCryptoTokenSeq received by the
BuiltinParticipantVolatileMessageSecureReader.

to the discovery and match of an authenticated remote DomainParticipant entity.

2.  Participant1 discovers the DomainParticipant (Participant2) via the DDS discovery
protocol. Participant2 is authenticated and its permissions are checked as described in 8.8.2
and 8.8.6. This is not repeated here. The authentication and permissions checking resulted
in the creation of an IdentityHandle, a PermissionsHandle, and a
SharedSecretHandle for Participant2.

3.  Participant1 calls the operation register_matched_remote_participant on the
Cryptographic plugin (CryptoKeyFactory interface) to store the association of the
remote identity and the SharedSecret.

Given a local DataWriter that is either a builtin secure DataWriter or an application
DataWriter meeting the condition stated above the DDS middleware shall:

1.  Call the operation create_local_datawriter_crypto_tokens on the

8.8.10 Cryptographic Plugins encoding/decoding behavior

This sub clause describes the behavior of the DDS implementation related to the
CryptoTransform interface.
This specification does not mandate a specific DDS implementation in terms of the internal logic or
timing when the different operations in the CryptoTransform plugin are invoked. The sequence

DDS Security, v1.1

169

charts below just express the requirements in terms of the operations that need to be called and their
interleaving. This specification only requires that by the time the RTPS message appears on the wire
the proper encoding operations have been executed first on each SerializedPayload submessage
element, then on the enclosing RTPS Submessage, and finally on the RTPS Message. Similarly by
the time a received RTPS Message is interpreted the proper decoding operations are executed on the
reverse order. First on the encoded RTPS Message, then on each set of secured submessages starting
with either a SecureRTPSPrefixSubMsg or SecurePrefixSubMsg, and finally on each
CryptoContent submessage element.

8.8.10.1  Encoding/decoding of a single writer message on an RTPS message

The figure below illustrates the functionality of the security plugins with regard to encoding the data,
Submessages and RTPS messages in the situation where the intended RTPS Message contains a

1.  The application writes data using a DataWriter belonging to Participant1. The DDS

implementation serializes the data.

2.  The DataWriter in Participant1 constructs the SerializedPayload RTPS

submessage element and calls the operation encode_serialized_payload. This
operation creates an RTPS SecData that protects the SerializedPayload potentially
encrypting it, adding a MAC and/or digital signature.

170

DDS Security, v1.1

3.  This step is notional; the specific mechanism depends on the DDS Implementation.
Participant1 realizes it is time to send the data written by the DataWriter to a remote
DataReader in Participant2.

4.  Participant1 constructs the RTPS Data Submessage to send to the DataReader and calls the

operation encode_datawriter_submessage to transform the original Data
submessage to a set of secure submessages (SecurePrefixSubMsg, original plain text
submessage or SecureBodySubMsg, and optional SecurePostfixSubMsg). This
same transformation would be applied to any DataWriter submessage (Data, Gap,
Heartbeat, DataFrag, HeartbeatFrag). The
encode_datawriter_submessage receives as parameters the
DatawriterCryptoHandle of the DataWriter and a list of
DatareaderCryptoHandle for all the DataReader entities to which the message
will be sent. Using a list allows the same set of secure submessages to be sent to all those
DataReader entities.

5.  Participant1 constructs the RTPS Message it intends to send to the DataReader (or

readers). It then calls encode_rtps_message to transform the original RTPS Message
into a new “encoded” RTPS Message with the same RTPS header and a set of secure
submessages protecting the contents of the original RTPS Message. The
encode_rtps_message receives as parameters the ParticipantCryptoHandle
of the sending DomainParticipant (Participant1) and a list of
ParticipantCryptoHandle for all the DomainParticipant entities to which the
message will be sent (Participant2). Using a list enables the DomainParticipant to
send the same message (potentially over multicast) to all those DomainParticipant
entities.

6.  Participant1 sends the new “encoded” RTPS Message obtained as a result of the previous

step to Participant2.

7.  Participant2 receives the “encoded” RTPS Message. Participant2 parses the message and
detects a SecureRTPSPrefixSubMsg. This indicates it shall call the operation
decode_rtps_message to process the prefix, body and optional postfix submessage. If
decode_rtps_message is successful, the result is an RTPS Message that can be
processed further.

8.  Participant2 parses the RTPS Message resulting from the previous step and encounters an

RTPS SecurePrefixSubMsg. This indicates it shall call the operation
prepare_rtps_submessage to determine whether this is a Writer submessage or a
Reader submessage and obtain the DatawriterCryptoHandle and
DatareaderCryptoHandle handles it needs to decode the message. This function
determines it is a Writer submessage.

9.  Participant2 calls the operation decode_datawriter_submessage passing in a data

stream that includes the SecurePrefixSubMsg, a plain text submessage or a
SecureBodySubMsg, and an optional SecurePostfixSubMsg. The
decode_datawriter_submessage operation also requires the
DatawriterCryptoHandle and DatareaderCryptoHandle obtained in the
previous step. The operation, if successful, will return the original Data submessage that

DDS Security, v1.1

171

was input to encode_datawriter_submessage on the DataWriter side. From the
Data submessage the DDS implementation extracts the CryptoContent submessage
element.

10. This step is notional; the specific mechanism depends on the DDS Implementation.

Participant2 realizes it is time to notify the DataReader and retrieve the actual data sent by
the DataWriter.

11. Participant2 calls decode_serialized_payload passing in the RTPS

CryptoContent and obtains the original SerializedPayload submessage element
was the input to the encode_serialized_payload on the DataWriter side. This
operation takes as arguments the DatawriterCryptoHandle and
DatareaderCryptoHandle obtained in step 8.

8.8.10.2  Encoding/decoding of multiple writer messages on an RTPS message

The figure below illustrates the functionality of the security plugins in the situation where the intended
RTPS message contains a multiple DataWriter RTPS Submessages, which can represent
multiple samples, from the same DataWriter or from multiple DataWriter entities, as well as, a mix
of Data, Heartbeat, Gap, and any other DataWriter RTPS Submessage as defined in 7.3.1.

submessages

The steps followed to encode and decode multiple DataWriter Submessages within the same RTPS
message are very similar to the ones used for a single Writer message. The only difference is that the
writer side can create multiple RTPS Submessages. In this case, Participant1 creates two Data
Submessages and a Heartbeat Submessage, transforms each separately using the
encode_datawriter_submessage, places them in the same RTPS message and then transforms
the RTPS Message containing all the resulting secured submessages using
encode_rtps_message.
The steps followed to decode the message are the reverse ones.

Note that the DataWriter entities that are sending the submessages and/or the DataReader entities that
are the destination of the different Submessages may be different. In this situation each call to
encode_serialized_payload(), encode_datawriter_submessage(),
decode_datawriter_submessage(), and encode_serialized_payload(), shall
receive the proper DatawriterCryptoHandle and DatareaderCryptoHandle handles.

1.  This step is notional; the specific mechanism depends on the DDS Implementation.
Participant2 realizes it is time to send an AckNack or NackFrag submessage from
DataReader to a remote DataWriter.

2.  Participant2 constructs the AckNack (or any other DataReader RTPS Submessage)
and calls the operation encode_datareader_submessage. This operation creates
multiple submessages: a SecurePrefixSubMsg, a plain text submessage or a
SecureBodySubMsg, and optionally a SecurePostfixSubMsg. This operation shall
receive as parameter the DatareaderCryptoHandle of the DataReader that sends
the submessage and a list of DatawriterCryptoHandle handles of all the
DataWriter entities to which the Submessage will be sent.

3.  Step 2 may be repeated multiple times constructing various secured submessages from

different DataReader RTPS Submessages. Different submessages may originate on
different DataReader entities and/or be destined for different DataWriter entities. On
each case the encode_datareader_submessage operation shall receive the

174

DDS Security, v1.1

DatareaderCryptoHandle and list of DatawriterCryptoHandle that
correspond to the source and destinations of that particular Submessage.

4.  Participant2 constructs the RTPS Message that contains the submessages obtained as a

result of the previous steps. It shall then call encode_rtps_message to transform the
“original” RTPS Message into a SecureRTPSPrefixSubMsg followed by either 1) an
INFO_SRC SubMsg and the contents of the RTPS Message or 2) a SecureBodySubMsg
(with INFO_SRC and encoded content), and finally a SecureRTPSPostfixSubMsg.

5.  Participant2 sends the “encoded” RTPS Message to Participant1 (and any other

destination DomainParticipant).

6.  Participant1 receives the “encoded” RTPS Message. Participant parses the message and
detects an RTPS SecureRTPSPrefixSubMsg. This indicates it should call the
operation decode_rtps_message to process the prefix, body and optional postfix
submessage. If decode_rtps_message is successful, the result is an RTPS Message
that can be processed further.

7.  Participant1 parses the RTPS Message resulting from the previous step and encounters an

RTPS SecurePrefixSubMsg. This indicates it shall call the operation
preprocess_secure_submessage to determine whether this is a Writer
submessage or a Reader submessage and obtain the DatawriterCryptoHandle and
DatareaderCryptoHandle handles it needs to decode the message. This function
determines it is a DataReader submessage.

8.  Participant1 calls decode_datareader_submessage passing in a data stream that

includes the SecurePrefixSubMsg, a plain text submessage or a
SecureBodySubMsg, and an optional SecurePostfixSubMsg. The
decode_datareader_submessage operation also requires the
DatawriterCryptoHandle and DatareaderCryptoHandle obtained in the
previous step. The operation, if successful, will return the original AckNack (or proper
DataReader submessage) submessage that was input to encode_datareader_submessage on
the DataReader side.

9.  This step is notional; the specific mechanism depends on the DDS Implementation.

Participant1 realizes it is time to notify the DataReader of the Acknowledgment, negative
acknowledgment or whatever the DataReader Submessage indicated.

10. Each RTPS SecurePrefixSubMsg encountered within the RTPS Message is processed
in this same way. The operation preprocess_rtps_submessage is first invoked and
if it indicates it is a DataReader submessage, Participant1 shall call
decode_datareader_submessage() on the submessage.

8.8.10.4  Encoding/decoding of reader and writer messages on an RTPS message

The figure below illustrates the functionality of the security plugins with regard to encoding the data,
Submessages and RTPS messages in the situation where the intended RTPS message contains multiple
RTPS Submessages which can represent a mix of different kinds of DataWriter and DataReader
submessages such as Data, Heartbeat, Gap, AckNack, NackFrag and any other RTPS
Submessage as defined in 7.3.1.

1.  The application writes data using a DataWriter belonging to Participant1. The DDS

implementation serializes the data.

2.  The DataWriter in Participant1 constructs the SerializedPayload RTPS

submessage element and calls the operation encode_serialized_payload. This
operation creates an RTPS SecData that protects the SerializedPayload potentially
encrypting it, adding a MAC and/or digital signature.

3.  This step is notional; the specific mechanism depends on the DDS Implementation.

Participant1 realizes it is time to send the data written by the DataWriter to a remote
DataReader.

4.  Participant1 constructs the RTPS Data Submessage that it will send to the DataReader
and calls the operation encode_datawriter_submessage to transform the original
Data submessage to a set of secured submessages.

5.  This step is notional. The specifics will depend on the DDS Implementation. Participant1
decides it needs to send a Heartbeat submessage along with the Data submessage. It
constructs the RTPS Heartbeat submessage and calls the operation
encode_datawriter_submessage() to transform the original Heartbeat
submessage to a set of secured submessages.

encode_datareader_submessage to transform the original AckNack submessage
to a set of secured submessages.

8.  Participant1 constructs the RTPS Message that contains the submessages obtained as a

result of the previous steps. It shall then call encode_rtps_message. To transform the
“original” RTPS Message into SecureRTPSPrefixSubMsg followed by either 1) an

SecureBodySubMsg (with INFO_SRC and encoded content), and finally a
SecureRTPSPostfixSubMsg.

9.  Participant1 sends the “encoded” RTPS Message to Participant2 (and any other

destination DomainParticipant).

10. Participant2 receives the “encoded” RTPS Message. Participant2 parses the message and
detects an RTPS SecureRTPSPrefixSubMsg. This indicates it should call the
operation decode_rtps_message to process the prefix, body and optional postfix
submessage. If decode_rtps_message is successful, the result is an RTPS Message
that can be processed further.

11. Participant2 parses the RTPS Message resulting from the previous step and encounters an

RTPS SecurePrefixSubMsg. This indicates it shall call
preprocess_secure_submessage to determine whether this is a Writer
submessage or a Reader submessage and obtain the DatawriterCryptoHandle and
DatareaderCryptoHandle handles it needs to decode the message. This function
determines it is a DataWriter submessage.

12. Participant1 calls the operation decode_datawriter_submessage, passing in a data

stream that includes the SecurePrefixSubMsg, a plain text submessage or a
SecureBodySubMsg, and an optional SecurePostfixSubMsg. The
decode_datawriter_submessage operation also requires the
DatawriterCryptoHandle and DatareaderCryptoHandle obtained in the
previous step. The operation, if successful, will return the original DataWriter submessage
that was input to encode_datawriter_submessage on the Participant1 side.

operation takes as arguments the DatawriterCryptoHandle and

DataWriter submessage and the proper DatawriterCryptoHandle and

16. Step 12 is repeated. Participant2 calls decode_datawriter_submessage passing in
a data stream that includes the SecurePrefixSubMsg, a plain text submessage or a
SecureBodySubMsg, and an optional SecurePostfixSubMsg. This transforms the
submessages into the original Heartbeat submessage.

9  Builtin Plugins

9.1

Introduction

This specification defines the behavior and implementation of at least one builtin plugin for each kind
of plugin. The builtin plugins provide out-of-the-box interoperability between implementations of this
specification.

The builtin plugins are summarized in the table below.

Table 43 – Summary of the Builtin Plugins

9.2  Requirements and Priorities (Non-Normative)

DDS:Logging:DDS_LogTopic

Logs security events to a dedicated DDS Log Topic

The selection of the builtin plugins was driven by several functional, as well as, non-functional
requirements, as described below.

Most DDS users surveyed consider the following functional requirements as essential elements of a
secure DDS middleware:

•  Authentication of applications (DDS Domain Participants) joining a DDS Domain.

•  Access control of applications subscribing to specific data at the Domain and Topic level.

•  Message integrity and data-origin authentication.

•  Encryption of a data sample using different encryption keys for different Topics.

In addition to these essential needs, many users also required that secure DDS middleware should
provide for:

•  Sending digitally signed data samples.

•  Sending data securely over multicast.

•  Tagging data.

•

Integrating with open standard security plugins.

Other functional requirements which are considered useful but less common were:

DDS Security, v1.1

179

•  Access control to certain samples within a Topic but not others, with access rights being

granted according to the data-sample contents or the data-sample key.

•  Access control to certain attributes within a data sample but not others, such that certain

DataReader entities can only observe a subset of the attributes as defined by their permissions.

•  Permissions that control which QoS might be used by a specific DDS Entity:

DomainParticipant, Publisher, DataWriter, Subscriber, or DataReader.

The primary non-functional requirements that informed the selection of the builtin plugins are:

•  Performance and Scalability.

•  Robustness and Availability.

•  Fit to the DDS Data-Centric Information Model.

•  Leverage and reuse of existing security infrastructure and technologies.

•  Ease of use while supporting common application requirements.

9.2.1  Performance and Scalability

DDS is commonly deployed in systems that demand high performance and need to scale to large
numbers of processes and computers. Different applications vary greatly in the number of processes,
Topics, and/or data-objects belonging to each Topic.

The policy enforcement/decision points as well as the transformations (cipher, decipher, hash)
performed by the plugins should not adversely degrade system performance and scalability beyond
what is tolerable and strictly needed. In practice this means several things for the builtin plugins:

•  The use of Asymmetric Key Cryptography shall be limited to the discovery, authentication,
session and shared-secret establishment phase (i.e., when a Participant discovers another
Participant, a DataReader and matching DataWriter). To the extent possible it shall not be used
in the critical path of data distribution.

•  The use of ciphers, HMACs, or digital signatures shall be selectable on a per stream (Topic)
basis. In case of encryption, symmetric ciphers should be used for the application data.

•

It shall be possible to provide integrity via HMAC techniques without also requiring the data to
be ciphered.

•  Multicast shall be supported even for ciphered data.

9.2.2  Robustness and Availability

DDS is deployed in mission-critical systems, which must continue to operate 24/7 despite partial
system malfunction. DDS also operates in fielded environments where specific components or systems
may be subject to accidental failure or active attack. DDS provides a highly robust infrastructure due to
the way the communication model and protocols are defined as they can be (and commonly are)
implemented in a peer-to-peer fashion without any centralized services. For this reason, many DDS
implementations have no single points of failure.

The builtin plugins should not negate these desirable properties present in the underlying DDS
middleware infrastructure.

180

DDS Security, v1.1

In practice, this means that:

•  Centralized policy decision points or services should be avoided.

•  The individual DDS DomainParticipant components should be self-contained and have what

they need to operate securely even in the presence of system partitions.

•  Multi-party key agreement protocols shall be avoided because they can be easily disrupted by

disrupting just one party.

•  Security tokens and keys should be compartmentalized as much as possible such that

compromise of an application component is contained to that component itself. For example,
selection of a system-wide secret key for the whole Domain or even for a Topic should be
avoided.

9.2.3  Fitness to the DDS Data-Centric Model

Application developers that use DDS think in terms of the data-centric elements that DDS provides.
That is, they think first and foremost about the Domains (global data spaces) the application must join
and the Topics that the application needs to read and write. Therefore, the builtin plugins should offer
the possibility to control access with this level of granularity.

Users of DDS also think about the data objects (keyed instances) they read and write, the ability to
dispose instances, filter by content, set QoS, and so forth. While it may be useful to offer ways to
provide access controls to this as well, it was considered of lesser priority and potentially conflicting
with the goal of ease of configurability and maintainability.

The semantics of DDS communications require that individual samples can be consumed
independently of each other. Depending on the QoS policy settings samples written by a single
DataWriter may be received and processed out of order relative to the order sent, or may be received
with intermediate gaps resulting from best-effort communication (if selected), or may be filtered by
content, time, or history, etc. For this reason, any encryption and/or digital signature applied to a
sample should be able to be processed in isolation, without requiring the receiver to maintain a specific
context reconstructed from previous samples.

9.2.4  Leverage and Reuse of Existing Security Infrastructure and Technologies

To the extent possible, it is desirable that the builtin plugins leverage and reuse existing IA technology
and tools. This not only reduces the barrier of entry for implementers of the specification, but also
more importantly enhances the quality of the result by allowing the use of proven, peer-reviewed,
and/or already certified approaches. The builtin plugins leverage existing standards and tools for PKI,
ciphers, hashing and digital signing. To the extent possible, ideas and approaches from existing
protocols for key management and secure multicast are also leveraged, although where appropriate
they have been adapted to the data-centric communications model of DDS and the DDS-RTPS wire
protocol.

9.2.5  Ease-of-Use while Supporting Common Application Requirements

It is anticipated that specialized applications may need to develop their own security plugins to either
integrate existing security infrastructure or meet specialized requirements. Therefore the primary
consumers of the builtin plugins will be users who want to secure their systems but not have complex
needs or significant legacy components. Under these conditions, ease-of-use is essential. A security

DDS Security, v1.1

181

infrastructure that is too hard to configure or too complex to understand or maintain is less likely to be
used, or may be used wrongly, resulting in systems that are less secure overall.

The builtin plugins balance rich functionality and ease-of-use, providing for the most common use
cases, in a manner that is easy to understand and use correctly.

9.3  Builtin Authentication: DDS:Auth:PKI-DH

This builtin authentication plugin is referred to as the “DDS:Auth:PKI-DH”.

The DDS:Auth:PKI-DH plugin implements authentication using a trusted Certificate
Authority (CA). It performs mutual authentication between discovered participants using the RSA
or ECDSA Digital Signature Algorithms [11] and establishes a shared secret using Diffie-Hellman
(DH) or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) Key Agreement Methods [12].

The CA could be an existing one. Or a new one could be created for the purpose of deploying
applications on a DDS Domain. The nature or manner in which the CA is selected is not important
because the way it is used enforces a shared recognition by all participating applications.

Prior to a DomainParticipant being enabled the DDS:Auth:PKI-DH plugin associated with the
DomainParticipant must be configured with three things:

1.  The X.509 Certificate that defines the Shared Identity CA. This certificate

contains the Public Key of the CA.

2.  The Private Key of the DomainParticipant.
3.  An X.509 Certificate that chains up to the Shared Identity CA, that binds the

Public Key of the DomainParticipant to the Distinguished Name (subject name)
for the DomainParticipant.

182

9.3.2  DDS:Auth:PKI-DH Types

This sub clause specifies the content and format of the Credential and Token objects used by the
DDS:Auth:PKI-DH plugin.

Credential and Token attributes left unspecified in this specification shall be understood to not
have any required values in this specification. These attributes shall be handled according to the
following rules:

184

DDS Security, v1.1

•  Plugin implementations may place data in these attributes as long as they also include a property
attribute that allows the implementation to unambiguously detect the presence and interpret these
attributes.

•  Attributes that are not understood shall be ignored.
•  Property_t and BinaryProperty_t names shall comply with the rules defined in 7.2.1 and

7.2.2, respectively.

The content of the Handle objects is not specified as it represents references to internal state that is
only understood by the plugin itself. The DDS Implementation only needs to hold a reference to the
returned Handle objects returned by the plugin operations and pass these Handle references to other
operations.

9.3.2.1  DDS:Auth:PKI-DH IdentityToken

The DDS:Auth:PKI-DH plugin shall set the attributes of the IdentityToken object as specified in
the table below.

7.4.3.5.  Plugin implementations shall ignore any properties they do not understand.

All the aforementioned properties shall appear within the signature
even if some of the optional properties do not appear separately as
properties in the HandshakeReplyMessageToken.

If the value of the c. kagree_algo property is “DH+MODP-2048-256”, then:

See also section 3.1 “Ephemeral Unified Model” of NIST Suite B Implementer’s Guide to
NIST SP 800-56A [49].

Regardless of the key agreement algorithm, the SharedSecret (see Table 53) shall be computed as
the SHA256 hash of the derived shared secret computed by the key agreement algorithm. [Non-
normative: This is done to accommodate the use of cryptographic libraries that do not provide direct
access to the derived shared secret and only allow retrieval of the SHA256 of the shared secret.]

The digital signature shall be computed using the Private Key associated with the DomainParticipant,
which corresponds to the Public Key that appears in the Identity Certificate.

validate_local_iden
tity

This operation shall receive the participant_guid associated with the local
DomainParticipant whose identity is being validated.
The operation shall receive the DomainParticipantQos with a
PropertyQosPolicy containing the properties defined in 9.3.1.
The operation shall verify the validity of the X509 certificate associated with the
property named dds.sec.auth.identity_certificate using the CA configured by the
dds.sec.auth.identity_ca property. The operation shall check a CRL and/or an
OCSP (RFC 2560 [52]) responder. This includes checking the expiration date of the
certificate.
If the above check fails, the operation shall return VALIDATION_FAILED.
The operation shall fill the handle with an implementation-dependent reference that
allows the implementation to retrieve at least the following information:

192

DDS Security, v1.1

1.  The private key associated with the identity_credential
2.  The public key associated with the identity_credential
3.  The participant_guid

The operation shall return the 16-byte adjusted_participant_guid GUID consisting
of the same EntityId_t and a GuidPrefix_t computed as follows:
•  The first bit (bit 0) shall be set to 1.
•  The 47 bits following the first bit (bits 1 to 47) shall be set to the 47 first bits of
the SHA-256 hash of the ASN.1 DER encoding of the SubjectName [40]
appearing on the identity_credential.

•  The following 48 bits (bits 48 to 95) shall be set to the first 48 bits of the SHA-

256 hash of the candidate_participant_guid.

If successful, the operation shall return VALIDATION_OK.

get_identity_token  The operation shall receive the handle corresponding to the one returned by a

successful previous call to validate_local_identity.
If the above condition is not met, the operation shall return the exception
DDS_SecurityException_PreconditionError.

argument remote_identity_token.
The contents of the IdentityToken shall be identical to what would be returned
by a call to get_identity_token on the Authentication plugin of the
remote DomainParticipant associated with the remote_participant_guid.
The operation shall compare the class_id of the local identity_token with that of the
remote_identity_token. If the PluginClassName or the MajorVersion are different,
it shall return VALIDATION_FAILED.

If the remote_auth_request_token is NIL, the operation shall generate a
local_auth_request_token AuthRequestMessageToken (see 9.3.2.4),
otherwise the local_auth_request_token shall be set to TokenNIL.  Note that a
local_auth_request_token is returned as an out parameter.

The operation shall compare lexicographically the remote_participant_guid with
the participant key obtained from the local_identity_handle.
If the remote_participant_guid > local_participant_guid, the operation shall return
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_REQUEST.
If the remote_participant_guid < local_participant_guid, the operation shall return
VALIDATION_PENDING_HANDSHAKE_MESSAGE.
In both scenarios the remote_identity_handle shall be filled with a reference to
internal plugin information that identifies the remote participant and associates it to
the contents of the remote_identity_token, the local_auth_request_token, the
remote_auth_request_token and any additional information required for the
challenge protocol.

the status is different from the aforementioned ones, it shall behave as if the
ocsp_status property was not present.

If the property ocsp_status is not present, the operation shall use its own means to

9.3.4  DDS:Auth:PKI-DH plugin authentication protocol

The operations the Secure DDS implementation executes on the Authentication plugin combined
with the behavior of the DDS:Auth:PKI-DH result in an efficient 3-message protocol that performs
mutual authentication and establishes a shared secret.

The rest of this sub clause describes the resulting protocol.

The authentication protocol is symmetric, that is there are no client and server roles. But only one
DomainParticipant should initiate the protocol. To determine which of the two
DomainParticipant entities shall initiate the protocol, each DomainParticipant compares
its own GUID with that of the other DomainParticipant. The DomainParticipant with the lower
GUID (using lexicographical order) initiates the protocol.

9.4  Builtin Access Control: DDS:Access:Permissions

Computes shared secret from DH1 and the DH
private key used for DH2

This builtin AccessControl plugin is referred to as the “DDS:Access:Permissions” plugin.
The DDS:Access:Permissions implements the AccessControl plugin API using a permissions
document signed by a shared Certificate Authority (CA).

The shared CA could be an existing one (including the same CA used for the Authentication
plugin), or a new one could be created for the purpose of assigning permissions to the applications on a
DDS Domain. The nature or manner in which the CA is selected is not important because the way it is
used enforces a shared recognition by all participating applications.

Each DomainParticipant has an associated instance of the DDS:Access:Permissions plugin.

9.4.1  Configuration

The DDS:Access:Permissions plugin is configured with three documents:

1.  The Permissions CA certificate
2.  The Domain governance signed by the Permissions CA
3.  The DomainParticipant permissions signed by the Permissions CA

The configuration of the builtin access control plugin shall be done using the PropertyQosPolicy
of the DomainParticipantQos. The specific properties used are described in Table 56 below.

9.4.1.1  Permissions CA Certificate

This is an X.509 certificate that contains the Public Key of the CA that will be used to sign the Domain
Governance and Domain Permissions document. The certificate can be self-signed or signed by some
other CA. Regardless of this the Public Key in the Certificate shall be trusted to sign the
aforementioned Governance and Permissions documents (see 9.4.1.2 and 9.4.1.3).

The Permissions CA Certificate shall be provided to the plugins using the PropertyQosPolicy on
the DomainParticipantQos as specified in Table 56.

9.4.1.2  Domain Governance Document

The domain governance document is an XML document that specifies how the domain should be
secured.

The domain governance document shall be signed by the Permissions CA. The signed document shall
use S/MIME version 3.2 format as defined in IETF RFC 5761 using SignedData Content Type (section
2.4.2 of IETF RFC 5761) formatted as multipart/signed (section 3.4.3 of IETF RFC 5761). This
corresponds to the mime-type application/pkcs7-signature. Additionally the signer certificate shall be
included within the signature.

The signed governance document shall be provided to the plugins using the PropertyQosPolicy
on the DomainParticipantQos as specified in Table 56.
The governance document specifies which DDS domain IDs shall be protected and the details of the
protection. Specifically this document configures the following aspects that apply to the whole domain:

•  Whether the discovery information should be protected and the kind of protection: only message

authentication codes (MACs) or encryption followed by MAC.

•  Whether the whole RTPS message should be protected and the kind of protection. This is in

addition to any protection that may occur for individual submessages and for submessage data
payloads.

•  Whether the liveliness messages should be protected.
•  Whether a discovered DomainParticipant that cannot authenticate or fail the authentication should
be allowed to join the domain and see any discovery data that are configured as ‘unprotected’ and
any Topics that are configured as ‘unprotected’.

•  Whether any discovered DomainParticipant that authenticates successfully should be allowed to

join the domain and see the discovery data without checking the access control policies.

In addition, the domain governance document specifies how the information on specific Topics within
the domain should be treated. Specifically:

•  Whether the discovery information on specific Topics should be sent using the secure (protected)

discovery writers or using the regular (unprotected) discovery writers.

DDS Security, v1.1

203

•  Whether read access to the Topic should be open to all or restricted to the DomainParticipants that

have the proper permissions.

•  Whether write access to the Topic should be open to all or restricted to the DomainParticipants that

have the proper permissions.

•  Whether the metadata information sent on the Topic (sequence numbers, heartbeats, key hashes,
gaps, acknowledgment messages, etc.) should be protected and the kind of protection (MAC or
Encrypt then MAC).

•  Whether the payload data sent on the Topic (serialized application level data) should be protected

and the kind of protection (MAC or Encrypt then MAC).

9.4.1.2.1  Basic Protection Kinds

The domain governance document provides a means for the application to configure the kinds of
cryptographic transformation applied to the complete RTPS Message, certain RTPS SubMessages, and
the SerializedPayload RTPS submessage element that appears within the Data and DataFrag
submessages.

The configuration allows specification of three protection levels: NONE, SIGN, ENCRYPT.

NONE indicates no cryptographic transformation is applied.

SIGN indicates the cryptographic transformation shall be purely a message authentication code
(MAC), that is, no encryption is performed. Therefore the resulting
CryptoTransformIdentifier for the output of the "encode" transformations shall have the
transformation_kind attribute set to the CRYPTO_TRANSFORMATION_KIND variants
AES_128_GMAC or AES_256_GMAC.
ENCRYPT indicates the cryptographic transformation shall be an encryption followed by a message
authentication code (MAC) computed on the ciphertext, also known as Encrypt-then-MAC. Therefore
the resulting CryptoTransformIdentifier for the output of the "encode" transformations shall
have the transformation_kind attribute set to the CRYPTO_TRANSFORMATION_KIND variants
AES_128_GCM or AES_256_GCM.
Protection Kinds
9.4.1.2.2

This configuration allows specification of two protection levels beyond the ones provided by the Basic
Protection Kind (9.4.1.2.1): SIGN_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION and
ENCRYPT_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION.

SIGN_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION indicates the cryptographic transformation shall be
purely a set of message authentication codes (MAC), that is, no encryption is performed. This
cryptographic transformation shall create a first “common authenticationcode” similar to the case
where Protection Kind is SIGN. In addition the cryptographic transformation shall create additional
authentication codes, each produced with a different secret key. Each of these additional secret keys
shall be shared only with a subset of the receivers. In the limit case each secret key is shared with only
one receiver. The additional MACs prove to the receiver that the sender originated the message,
preventing other receivers from impersonating the sender.

The resulting CryptoTransformIdentifier for the output of the "encode" transformations shall
have the transformation_kind attribute set to the CRYPTO_TRANSFORMATION_KIND variants
AES_128_GMAC or AES_256_GMAC.

204

DDS Security, v1.1

ENCRYPT_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION indicates the cryptographic transformation
shall be an encryption followed by a message authentication code (MAC) computed on the ciphertext,
followed by additional authentication codes. Each of the additional authentication codes shall use a
different secret key. The encryption and first (common) authentication code is similar to ones produced
when the Protection Kind is ENCRYPT.  The additional authentication codes are similar to the ones
produced when the Protection Kind is SIGN_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION.

The resulting CryptoTransformIdentifier for the output of the "encode" transformations shall
have the transformation_kind attribute set to the CRYPTO_TRANSFORMATION_KIND variants
AES_128_GCM or AES_256_GCM.

This element is delimited by the XML element <enable_read_access_control>.

This element may take the boolean values TRUE or FALSE.

The setting shall control the contents of the TopicSecurityAttributes returned by the
AccessControl::get_topic_sec_attributes operation on any Topic whose associated
Topic name matches the rule’s topic expression. Specifically the is_read_protected attribute in the
TopicSecurityAttributes shall be set to the boolean value specified in the
<enable_read_access_control> element.

In addition, this element shall control the AccessControl::check_create_datareader
operation on any DataReader entity whose associated Topic name matches the rule’s topic
expression. Specifically:

•  If the value of <enable_write_access_control> element is FALSE, the operation

check_create_datareader shall return TRUE without further checking the Permissions
document.

•  If the value of <enable_write_access_control> element is TRUE, the operation

check_create_datareader shall return a value according to what is specified in the
Permissions document, see 9.4.1.3.

9.4.1.2.6.5

Enable Write Access Control element

This element is delimited by the XML element <enable_write_access_control>.

This element may take the boolean values TRUE or FALSE.

The setting shall control the contents of the TopicSecurityAttributes returned by the
AccessControl::get_topic_sec_attributes operation on any Topic whose associated
Topic name matches the rule’s topic expression. Specifically the is_write_protected attribute in the
TopicSecurityAttributes shall be set to the binary value specified in the
<enable_write_access_control> element.

In addition, this element shall control the AccessControl::check_create_datawriter
operation on any DataWriter entity whose associated Topic name matches the rule’s topic
expression. Specifically:

•  If the value of <enable_write_access_control> element is FALSE, the operation

check_create_datawriter shall return TRUE without further checking the Permissions
document.

•  If the value of <enable_write_access_control> element is TRUE, the operation

check_create_datawriter shall return a value according to what is specified in the
Permissions document, see 9.4.1.3.

9.4.1.2.6.6  Metadata Protection Kind element

This element is delimited by the XML element <metadata_protection_kind>.

This element may take the Protection Kind values NONE, SIGN, ENCRYPT,
SIGN_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION, or ENCRYPT_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION.

The setting of this element shall specify the protection kind (see 9.4.1.2.2) used for the RTPS
SubMessages sent by any DataWriter and DataReader whose associated Topic name
matches the rule’s topic expression.

The setting of this element shall also control the contents of the EndpointSecurityAttributes
and PluginEndpointSecurityAttributes returned by the
AccessControl::get_datawriter_sec_attributes and
AccessControl::get_datareader_sec_attributes operation on any DataWriter or
DataReader entity whose associated Topic name matches the rule’s topic expression. Specifically:
-  The attribute is_submessage_protected in the EndpointSecurityAttributes shall be

set to FALSE if the value specified in the <metadata_protection_kind> is NONE and shall be
set to TRUE otherwise.

-  The attribute is_submessage_encrypted in the PluginEndpointSecurityAttributes
(see 9.4.2.5) shall be set to TRUE if the value specified in the <metadata_protection_kind> is
ENCRYPT or ENCRYPT_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION and to FALSE otherwise.

-  The attribute is_submessage_origin_authenticated in the

PluginEndpointSecurityAttributes (see 9.4.2.5) shall be set to TRUE if the value
specified in the <metadata_protection_kind> is
SIGN_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION or
ENCRYPT_WITH_ORIGIN_AUTHENTICATION and to FALSE otherwise.

9.4.1.2.6.7  Data Protection Kind element

This element is delimited by the XML element <data_protection_kind>.

This element may take the Basic Protection Kind values: NONE, SIGN, or ENCRYPT.

The setting of this element shall specify the basic protection kind (see 9.4.1.2.1) used for the RTPS
SerializedPayload submessage element sent by any DataWriter whose associated Topic
name matches the rule’s topic expression.

The setting shall control the contents of the EndpointSecurityAttributes and
PluginEndpointSecurityAttributes returned by the
AccessControl::get_datawriter_sec_attributes operation on any DataWriter
entity whose associated Topic name matches the rule’s topic expression. Specifically the
PluginEndpointSecurityAttributes attributes is_payload_protected and is_key_protected,
as well as the PluginEndpointSecurityAttributes attribute is_payload_encrypted (see
9.4.2.6):

•

•

If the value specified in the <data_protection_kind> element is NONE, then
is_payload_protected, is_key_protected and is_payload_encrypted shall be set to FALSE.
If the value specified in the <data_protection_kind> element is SIGN, then
is_payload_protected shall be set to TRUE. The attributes is_key_protected and
is_payload_encrypted shall be set to FALSE.

DDS Security, v1.1

213

•

If the value specified in the <data_protection_kind>  element is ENCRYPT, then
is_payload_protected, is_key_protected, and is_payload_encrypted shall be set to TRUE.

9.4.1.2.7  Application of Domain and Topic Rules

For a given DomainParticipant the Domain Rules shall be evaluated in the same order they
appear in the Governance document. The first Domain Rule having a <domains> element whose value
matches the DomainParticipant domain_id shall be the one applied to the
DomainParticipant.
If no Domain Rule matches the DomainParticipant domain_id the operation under consideration
shall fail with a suitable “permissions error”. If desired, to avoid this situation, a  “default” Domain
Rule can be added to the end using the expression:
    <domains>
        <id_range>
            <min>0</min>
        </id_range>
    </domains>

This rule will match any domain_id not matched by the rules that appear before.

For a given Topic, DataWriter or DataReader DDS Entity belonging to a
DomainParticipant the Topic Rules appearing within the Domain Rule that applies to that
DomainParticipant shall be evaluated in the same order they appear in the Governance
document. The first Topic Rule having a <topic_expression> element whose value matches the topic
name associated with the Entity shall be the one applied to the Entity.
If no Topic Rule matches the Entity topic name the operation under consideration shall fail with a
suitable “permissions error”. If desired, to avoid this situation, a  “default” Topic Rule can be added to
the end using the expression  <topic_expression>*</ topic_expression >. This rule will match any
topic name not matched by the rules that appear before.

9.4.1.3  DomainParticipant permissions document

The permissions document is an XML document containing the permissions of the domain participant
and binding them to the distinguished name of the DomainParticipant as defined in the
DDS:Auth:PKI-DH authentication plugin.

The permissions document shall be signed by the Permissions CA. The signed document shall use
S/MIME version 3.2 format as defined in IETF RFC 5761 using SignedData Content Type (section
2.4.2 of IETF RFC 5761) formatted as multipart/signed (section 3.4.3 of IETF RFC 5761). This
corresponds to the mime-type application/pkcs7-signature. Additionally the signer certificate shall be
included within the signature.

The signed permissions document shall be provided to the plugins using the PropertyQosPolicy
on the DomainParticipantQos as specified in Table 56.
The format of this document is defined using the following XSD.

9.4.1.3.1

Permissions Section

The XML permissions document contains a permissions Section. This is the portion of the XML
document delimited by the <permissions> XML element tag.
The permissions Section contains a set of grant sections.

9.4.1.3.2  Grant Section

The grant sections appear within the permissions Section delimited by the <grant> XML element tag.

218

DDS Security, v1.1

Each grant Section contains three sections:

1.  Subject name Section (subject_name element)

2.  Validity Section (validity element)

3.  Rules Section (allow, deny and default elements)

The contents and delimiters of each Section are described below.

9.4.1.3.2.1

Subject name Section

This Section is delimited by the XML element <subject_name>.

The subject name Section identifies the DomainParticipant to which the permissions apply. Each
subject name can only appear in a single <permissions> Section within the XML Permissions
document.

The contents of the <subject_name> element shall be the x.509 subject name for the
DomainParticipant as is given in its Authorization Certificate. A permissions Section with a
subject name that does not match the subject name given in the corresponding Authorization certificate
shall be ignored.

The X.509 subject name is a set of name-value pairs. The format of x.509 subject name shall be the
string representation of the X.509 certificate Subject name as defined in IETF RFC 4514 "Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP): String Representation of Distinguished Names" [51].

For example:

<subject_name>emailAddress=cto@acme.com, CN=DDS Shapes Demo, OU=CTO Office,
O=ACME Inc., L=Sunnyvale, ST=CA, C=US</subject_name>
9.4.1.3.2.2

Validity Section

This Section is delimited by the XML element <validity>. The contents of this element reflect the
valid dates for the permissions. It contains both the starting date and the end date using the format
defined by dateTime data type as specified in sub clause 3.3.7 of [XSD]. Time zones that aren't
specified are considered UTC.

A permissions Section with a validity date that falls outside the current date at which the permissions
are being evaluated shall be ignored.

9.4.1.3.2.3  Rules Section

This Section contains the permissions assigned to the DomainParticipant. It is described as a set
of rules.

The rules are applied in the same order that appear in the document. If the criteria for the rule matches
the domain_id join and/or publish or subscribe operation that is being attempted, then the allow or
deny decision is applied. If the criteria for a rule does not match the operation being attempted, the
evaluation shall proceed to the next rule. If all rules have been examined without a match, then the
decision specified by the “default” rule is applied. The default rule, if present, must appear after all
allow and deny rules. If the default rule is not present, the implied default decision is DENY.

DDS Security, v1.1

219

The matching criteria for each rule specify the domain_id, topics (published and subscribed), the
partitions (published and subscribed), and the data-tags associated with the DataWriter and
DataReader.
For the grant to match there shall be a match of the topics, partitions, and data-tags criteria. This is
interpreted as an AND of each of the criteria. For a specific criterion to match (e.g., <topics>) it is
enough that one of the topic expressions listed matches (i.e., an OR of the expressions with the
<topics> section).

9.4.1.3.2.3.1

Format of the allow rules

Allow rules appear inside the <allow_rule> XML Element. Each rule contains  a Domains Section;
(9.4.1.3.2.3.1.1), followed by a set of allowed actions. There are three kinds of allowed actions:
publish, subscribe and relay.

9.4.1.3.2.3.1.1  Domains Section

This Section is delimited by the XML element <domains>.

The value in this element identifies the collection of DDS domain_id values to which the rule applies.
The syntax is the same as for the domain section of the Governance document. See subclause
9.4.1.2.5.1.

For example:

<domains>
    <id>0</id>
</domains>

9.4.1.3.2.3.1.2

Format of the Allowed Actions sections

The sections for each of the three action kinds have similar format. The only difference is the name of
the XML element used to delimit the action:

•  The Allow Publish Action is delimited by the <publish> XML element

•  The Allow Subscribe Action is delimited by the <subscribe> XML element

•  The Allow Relay Action is delimited by the <relay> XML element

Each allowed action logically contains three orthogonal conditions. These cover the topic name,
partitions, and data-tags. All these conditions must be met for the allowed action to apply. Note that
some of these conditions may not appear explicitly in the XML file. In this case a specified default
value is assumed and applied as if the condition had been explicitly listed.

Each of these three conditions appears in a separate section:

•  Allowed Topics Condition section

•  Allowed Partitions Condition section

•  Allowed Data Tags Condition section

220

DDS Security, v1.1

Example:

<publish>         <!— delimits the publish action  -->
    <topics>      <!— delimits the topic condition -->
        <topic>Square</topic>
    </topics>
    <partitions>  <!— delimits the partition condition -->
        <partition>A_partition</partition>
    </partitions>
                  <!— data tags condition absent so use default -->
</publish>

9.4.1.3.2.3.1.3  Allowed Topic condition section

The topic condition section is delimited by the <topics> XML element. It defines the DDS Topic
names that must be matched for the allow rule to apply. Topic names may be given explicitly or by
means of Topic name expressions. Each topic name or topic-name expression appears separately in a
<topic> sub-element within the <topics> element.

The Topic name expression syntax and matching shall use the syntax and rules of the POSIX fnmatch()
function as specified in POSIX 1003.2-1992, Section B.6 [38].

In order for an action (e.g., a publish action) to be allowed it must meet the topic condition. For this to
happen the Topic name associated with the intended action must match one the topics or topic
expressions explicitly listed in the topic condition section.

The topic condition section must always be present; therefore there is no default specfied.

Example (appearing within a <allow_rule> and within a publish, subscribe, or relay action):

    <topics>
        <topic>Square</topic>
        <topic>B*</topic>
    </topics>
The above topic condition would match Topic “Square” and any topic that starts with a “B”.

9.4.1.3.2.3.1.4  Allowed Partitions condition section

The allowed partitions condition section is delimited by the  <partitions> XML element. It limits the
set DDS Partitions names that may be associated with the (publish, subscribe, relay) action for the rule
to apply. Partition names may be given explicitly or by means of Partition name expressions. Each
partition name or partition-name expression appears separately in a <partition> sub-element within
the <partitions> element.

The Partition name expression syntax and matching shall use the syntax and rules of the POSIX
fnmatch() function as specified in POSIX 1003.2-1992, Section B.6 [38].

In order for an action (e.g., a publish action) to meet the allowed partitions condition that appears
within an allow rule, the set of the Partitions associated with the DDS entity (DataWriter or
DataReader) attempting the (publish, subscribe, or relay) action must be contained in the set of
partitions defined by the allowed partitions condition section.

DDS Security, v1.1

221

If there is no <partitions> Section within an allow rule, then the default "empty string" partition is
assumed. See PARTITION QosPolicy entry in Qos Policies table of section 2.2.3 (Supported Qos) of
the DDS Specification version 1.4. This means that the allow rule (e.g., publish) would only allow a
DataWriter to publish on the “empty string” partition.

Example (appearing within a <allow_rule> and within a <publish> action):

    <partitions>
        <partition>A</partition>
        <partition>B</partition>
    </partitions>

The above allowed partitions condition would be matched if the partitions associated with the DDS
Entity attempting to perform the action (e.g., publish action) is a subset of the set {A, B}.  So it would
be OK to publish in partition A, in B, or in {A, B} but not in {A, B, C}.

For legacy reasons DDS-Security implementations shall provide a way to select an alternative “legacy
matching” behavior. The “legacy matching behavior” shall match the allowed partitions condition
condition as long as one or more of the Partitions associated with DDS Entity attempting to perform
the action (e.g., DataWriter for a publish action) matches one of the partitions in the allowed partitions
condition.  The same allowed partitions condition section above would be matched if the partitions
associated with the DDS DataWriter include A or B.  So it would be OK to publish in A, in B, or in {A,
B} and also in {A, B, C}.

9.4.1.3.2.3.1.5  Allowed Data tags condition section

The allowed data tags condition section is delimited by the < data_tags> XML element. It limits the
set DDS Data Tags that may be associated with the (publish, subscribe, relay) action for the rule to
apply. The <data_tags> XML Element contain a set of tags.

In order for an action (e.g., a publish action) to meet the allowed data tags condition the set of the
Data Tags associated with the DDS Entity performing the action (e.g., a DataWriter for a publish
action) must be contained in the set of data tags defined by the allowed data tags condition section.

If there is no <data_tags> section then the default empty set is assumed. This means that the allow
action (e.g., publish action) would only allow publishing if there are no data tags associated with the
DDS Endpoint (DataWriter for a publish action).

Example (appearing within a <allow_rule> and within a <publish> action):

    <data_tags>
        <tag>
            <name>aTagName1</name>
            <value>aTagValue1</value>
        </tag>
    </data_tags>

The above allowed data tags condition would be matched if the data tags associated with the DDS
Entity performing the action (e.g., DataWriter for publish action) are a subset of the set { (aTagName1,
aTagValue)} } .  So it would be OK to publish using a DataWriter with no associated data-tags, or a
DataWriter with a single tag with name “aTagName1” and value “aTagValue1”.

9.4.1.3.2.3.2

Format for deny rules

Deny rules appear inside the <deny_rule> XML Element. Each rule contains a Domains Section;
(9.4.1.3.2.3.1.1), followed by a set of denied actions. There are three kinds of denied actions: publish,
subscribe and relay.

Deny rules have the same format as the allow rules. The only difference is how they are interpreted. If
the criteria in the deny rule matches the operation being performed, then the decision is to deny the
operation.

DDS Security, v1.1

223

9.4.1.3.2.3.2.1  Domains Section

This Section is delimited by the XML element <domains>. The value in this element identifies the
collection of DDS domain_id values to which the rule applies.  The syntax is the same as for the
domain section of the Governance document. See subclause 9.4.1.2.5.1.

For example:
<domains>
    <id>0</id>
</domains>

9.4.1.3.2.3.2.2

Format of the Denied Actions sections

The sections for each of the three action kinds have similar format. The only difference is the name of
the XML element used to delimit the action:

•  The Deny Publish Action is delimited by the <publish> XML element.

•  The Deny Subscribe Action is delimited by the <subscribe> XML element.

•  The Deny Relay Action is delimited by the <relay> XML element.

Each denied action logically contains three orthogonal deny conditions. These cover the topic name,
partitions, and data-tags. All these conditions must be met for the denied action to apply. Note that
some of these conditions may not appear explicitly in the XML file. In this case a specified default
value is assumed and applied as if the condition had been explicitly listed.

Each of these three conditions appears in a separate section:

•  Denied Topics Condition section.

•  Denied Partitions Condition section.

•  Denied Data Tags Condition section.

Example (appearing within a <deny_rule>):

<publish>         <!— delimits the publish action  -->
    <topics>      <!— delimits the topic condition -->
        <topic>Square</topic>
    </topics>
    <partitions>  <!— delimits the partition condition -->
        <partition>A_partition</partition>
    </partitions>
                  <!— data tags condition absent so use default -->
</publish>

9.4.1.3.2.3.2.3  Denied Topic condition section

The denied topic condition section is delimited by the <topics> XML element. It has the same format
and interpretation as the allowed topic condition section for the allowed actions, see 9.4.1.3.2.3.1.3.

224

DDS Security, v1.1

In order for an action (e.g., a publish action) to be denied it must meet the denied topic condition. For
this to happen the Topic name associated with the intended action must match one the topics or topic
expressions explicitly listed in the denied topic condition section.

9.4.1.3.2.3.2.4  Denied Partitions condition section

The denied partitions condition section is delimited by the <partitions> XML element. It defines the
DDS Partitions names that when associated with the (publish, subscribe, relay) cause the deny action
for the rule to apply. Partition names may be given explicitly or by means of Partition name
expressions. Each partition name or partition-name expression appears separately in a <partition>
sub-element within the <partitions> element.

In order for an action (e.g., a publish action) to be denied it must meet the denied partitions condition.
For this to happen one of more of the partition names associated with the DDS Entity performing the
action (e.g., a DataWriter for the publish action) must match one the partitions or partition expressions
explicitly listed in the partitions condition section.

If there is no <partitions> section then the "*" partition expression is assumed. This means that the
deny action (e.g., deny publish action) would apply independent of the partition associated with the
DDS Endpoint (DataWriter for the publish action).

Example (appearing within a <deny_rule> and within a <publish> action):

    <partitions>
        <partition>A</partition>
        <partition>B</partition>
    </partitions>

The above denied partitions condition would be matched if the partitions associated with the DDS
Entity performing the action (e.g., DataWriter for a publish action) intersect the set {A, B}.  So it
would be OK to publish in C, but not in {A}, {A, B}, or {A, B, C}.

9.4.1.3.2.3.2.5  Data tags condition section

The denied data tags condition section is delimited by the <data_tags> XML element. It defines the
DDS tags names and values that when associated with the (publish, subscribe, relay) cause the deny
action for the rule to apply.

In order for an action (e.g., a publish action) to be denied it must meet the denied data tags condition.
For this to happen the DDS Entity associated with the action (e.g., DataWriter for a publish action)
must have a  data tag name and value pair associated that matches one the data tags explicitly listed in
the denied data tags condition section.

If there is no <data_tags> section then the “set of all possible tags” set is assumed as default. This
means that the deny action (e.g., deny publish action) would apply independent of the data tags
associated with the DDS Endpoint (e.g., DataWriter for a publish action).

Example (appearing within a <deny_rule> and within a <publish> action):

    <data_tags>
        <tag>
            <name>aTagName1</name>
            <value>aTagValue1</value>

DDS Security, v1.1

225

        </tag>
    </data_tags>

The above denied data tags condition would be matched if the data tags associated with the DDS
Entity performing the action (e.g., DataWriter for a publish action) intersect the set { (aTagName1,
aTagValue1) }.  So it would not deny publishing using a DataWriter with no associated data-tags, or a
DataWriter with a single tag with name “aTagName2”, or a DataWriter with a single tag with name
“aTagName1” and value “aTagValue2”. But it would deny publishing using a DataWriter with with
two associated data-tags { (aTagName1, aTagValue1),  (aTagName2, aTagValue2)}.

9.5  Builtin Crypto: DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC

The builtin Cryptographic plugin is referred to as “DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC” plugin.
DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC provides authenticated encryption using Advanced Encryption
Standard (AES) in Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM) [45]. It supports two AES key sizes:  128 bits
and 256 bits. It may also provide additional reader-specific message authentication codes (MACs)
using Galois MAC (AES-GMAC) [45].

The definition of the AES-GCM and AES-GMAC transformations shall be as specified in NIST SP
800-38D [45] specialized to 128-bit and 256-bit AES keys with 96-bit Initialization Vector. The most
relevant aspects are summarized below.

The AES-GCM authenticated encryption operation is a transformation that takes the four inputs and
produces two outputs, symbolically:

C, T =  AES-GCM(K, P, AAD, IV)

The AES-GCM inputs are described in Table 64.

It may be empty in case we only want to authenticate data.

This is data beyond the plaintext that will only be authenticated. I.e. it is not encrypted.

The AES-GCM transformation outputs are described in Table 65.

This is a 96-bit NONCE that shall not be repeated for the same key.

generate the counter blocks. As recommended in section 5.2.1.1 of NIST SP 800-38D [45] the counter
blocks shall be created from the 96-bit Initialization Vector as follows:

242

DDS Security, v1.1

•  The initial value of the 128-bit counter block is a 128-bit string containing the IV as the leading

•

96 bits and zeros the remaining right-most 32 bits.
Incremental values of the 128-bit counter block used to encrypt each block are obtained using
the “inc32” function which increments the right-most 32 bits of the string, regarded as the
binary representation of a big-endian integer, modulo 2^32. The inc32 operation does not touch
the leading 96 bits.

The AES-GMAC transformation is defined as the special case where the plaintext “P” is empty (zero
length). This transformation produces only an AuthenticationTag (Message Authentication Code) on
the AAD data:

T =  AES-GMAC(K, AAD, IV) = AES-GCM(K, “”, AAD, IV)

The use of (Galois) counter mode allows authenticated decryption of blocks in arbitrary order. All that
is needed to decrypt and validate the authentication tag are the Key and the Initialization Vector. This is
very important for DDS because a DataReader may not receive all the samples written by a
matched DataWriter. The use of DDS ContentFilteredTopics as well as DDS QoS policies
such as History (with KEEP_LAST kind), Reliability (with BEST_EFFORTS kind),
Lifespan, and TimeBasedFilter, among others, can result in a DataReader receiving a
subset of the samples written by a DataWriter.
The AES-GCM transformation produces both the ciphertext and a message authentication code (MAC)
using the same secret key. This is sufficient to protext the plaintext and ensure integrity. However there
are situations where multiple MACs are required. For example when a DataWriter shares the same Key
with multiple DataReaders and, in spite of this, the DataWriter needs to ensure message-origin
authentication. In this situation the DataWriter should create a separate “reader-specific key” used only
for authentication and append additional reader-specific MACs, each computed with one of the reader-
specific keys.

9.5.1  Configuration

The DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC plugin requires no additional configuration as part of this
specification. However this specification reserves all PropertyQos names with the prefix
“dds.sec.crypto.” for use in future revisions of this specification.

9.5.2  DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC Types

The Cryptographic plugin defines a set of generic data types to be used to initialize the plugin and
to externalize the properties and material that must be shared with the applications that need to decode
the cipher material, verify signatures, etc.

Each plugin implementation defines the contents of these types in a manner appropriate for the
algorithms it uses. All “Handle” types are local opaque handles that are only understood by the local
plugin objects that create or use them. The remaining types shall be fully specified so that independent
implementations of DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC can interoperate.

9.5.2.1  DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoToken

The DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC plugin shall set the attributes of the CryptoToken object as
specified in the table below.

9.5.2.3  DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoHeader

.

The DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoTransform interface has several operations that
transform plain text into cipher text. The cipher-text created by these “encode” operations
contains a CryptoHeader that is interpreted by the corresponding “decode” operations on the
receiving side.

The CryptoHeader structure is described by the Extended IDL below:

// Serialized as Big Endian
@extensibility(FINAL)
struct CryptoHeader {
    CryptoTransformIdentifier transform_identifier;
    octet                     session_id[4];
    octet                     initialization_vector_suffix[8];
};

As indicated by the IDL above, the plugin_crypto_header_extra attribute introduced in 7.3.6.4.2
consists of the session_id and the initialization_vector_suffix.

The transformation_indentifier combined with the identity of the sending DomainParticipant
uniquely identifies the KeyMaterial used to transform the plaintext into the cipher text.
The session_id combined with the KeyMaterial uniquely identifies the cryptographic keys used for
the encryption and MAC operations.

The initialization_vector_suffix combined with the session_id uniquely identifies the
Initialization Vector used as part of the AES-GCM and AES-GMAC transformations.
The CryptoHeader structure shall be serialized using Big Endian serialization (a.k.a. network byte
order).

9.5.2.4  DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoContent

The DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoTransform interface has operations that transform
plaintext into cipher text. The cipher-text created by some of these “encode” operations contains a
CryptoContent submessage element (see 7.3.6.2) that is interpreted by the corresponding “decode”
operations on the receiving side.

DDS Security, v1.1

247

The CryptoContent structure is described by the Extended IDL below:

// Serialized as Big Endian
@extensibility(FINAL)
struct CryptoContent  {
    sequence<octet>     crypto_content;
};

The CryptoContent structure shall be serialized using Big Endian serialization (a.k.a. network byte
order).

9.5.2.5  DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoFooter

The DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC CryptoTransform interface has several operations that
transform plaintext into cipher text. The cipher-text created by these “encode” operations contains a
CryptoFooter that is interpreted by the corresponding “decode” operations on the receiving side.
The CryptoFooter structure is described by the Extended IDL below:

// Serialized as Big Endian
@extensibility(FINAL)
struct ReceiverSpecificMAC {
    CryptoTransformKeyId  receiver_mac_key_id;
    octet                 receiver_mac[16];
};

// Serialized as Big Endian
@extensibility(FINAL)
struct CryptoFooter {
    octet                          common_mac[16];
    sequence<ReceiverSpecificMAC>  receiver_specific_macs;
};

As indicated by the IDL above, the crypto_footer attribute introduced in 7.3.6.5 consists of the
common_mac and the receiver_specific_macs.

The receiver-specific Message Authentication Codes (MACs) are computed with a secret key that the
sender shares only with one receiver. The receiver-specific MACs provide message-origin
authentication to the receiver even when the sender is communicating with multiple receivers via
multicast and shares the same encryption key will all of them.

The ReceiverSpecificMAC and CryptoFooter structures shall be serialized using Big Endian
serialization (a.k.a. network byte order).

If the RTPS Protection Kind (see 9.4.1.2.5.6) does not specify the use of origin
authentication, then the receiver_specific_key_id shall be set to zero and the
master_receiver_specific key shall be set to the empty sequence.

If the RTPS Protection Kind (see 9.4.1.2.5.6) specifies the use of origin
authentication, then a new secret key
(MasterReceiverParticipantSpecificKey) shall be created, the
receiver_specific_key_id shall be set to identify this new key, and the
master_receiver_specific key field shall contain
MasterReceiverParticipantSpecificKey.
The Participant2ParticipantKeyMaterial shall be used to transform and
authenticate the RTPS messages.

The Participant2ParticipantKeyMaterial shall be sent to the remote
DomainParticipant using the operations of the CryptoKeyExchange.
This operation also creates
the SharedSecret passed as a parameter. This key material shall be associated
with the local and remote ParticipantCryptoHandle pair. We will refer to this
key material as the Participant2ParticipantKxKeyMaterial. It is used
to exchange key material between DomainParticipant entities.

one or two elements depending on the settings of the Metadata Protection Kind (see
9.4.1.2.6.6) and Data Protection Kind (see 9.4.1.2.6.7).

If the Metadata Protection Kind is different from NONE, then the operation shall
create a KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC to use for the
encode_datawriter_submessage operation. In addition, this key material
shall appear as the first element in the KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC_Seq.
If the Data Protection Kind is different from NONE, then the operation shall create a
KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC to use for the
encode_serialized_payload operation.
In the case where both meta-data protection and data protection are the same, it is
allowed for an implementation to reuse the same key material for both. In this case the
KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC_Seq would contain only one element. This “key
reuse” aspect shall be configurable but the configuration mechanism is not specified.

The transformation_kind for the KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC objects
determines whether the transformation performs authentication only (GMAC) or
encryption followed by authentication (GCM). The selection between these two
options for each created KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC object shall be done
according to the setting of corresponding Protection Kind.

The transformation_kind for the KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC objects also
determines whether the encryption and/or authentication uses 128-bit or 256-bit keys.
This aspect shall be configurable but the configuration mechanism is not specified.

Encode/decode operation virtual machine

The logical operation of the DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC is described in terms of a virtual machine
as it performs the encrypt message digest operations. This is not intended to mandate implementations
should follow this approach literally, simply that the observable results for any plaintext are the same
as the virtual machine described here.

For any given cryptographic session the operation of the DDS:Crypto:AES-GCM-GMAC transforms
plaintext into ciphertext can be described in terms of a virtual machine that maintains the following
state.

All the key material with a name that starts with “Master” corresponds to the
KeyMaterial_AES_GCM_GMAC objects that were created by the CryptoKeyFactory
operations. This key material is not used directly to encrypt or compute MAC of the plaintext. Rather it
is used to create “Session” Key material by means of the algorithms described below. This has the
benefit that the ‘session’ keys used to secure the data stream data can be modified as needed to
maintain the security of the stream without having to perform explicit rekey and key-exchange
operations.

 is reset to zero.

9.5.3.3.3  Computation of SessionKey and SessionReceiverSpecificKey

The SessionKey and SessionReceiverSpecificKey are computed from the MasterKey,
MasterSalt and the SessionId:

SessionKey := HMAC256(MasterKey,"SessionKey" | MasterSalt | SessionId)

SessionReceiverSpecificKey
    := HMAC256(MasterReceiverSpecificKey,
               "SessionReceiverKey" | MasterSalt | SessionId)

HMAC256 is a HMAC-SHA256. In case a 128 key is desired the 256 bit HMAC is truncated to the
first 128 bits.

In the above expressions the symbol ‘|’ indicates concatenation.

258

DDS Security, v1.1

9.5.3.3.4  Computation of ciphertext from plaintext

The ciphertext is computed from the plain text using AES in Galois Counter Mode (AES-GCM).

The encryption transforms the plaintext input into ciphertext by performing an encryption operation
using the AES-GCM algorithm in counter mode using the SessionKeys associated with the specified
KeyHandle. The encryption transformation is described in detail in the sections that follow.

The encryption operation uses a 96-bit initialization vector constructed as:

     InitializationVector =  SessionId | InitializationVectorSuffix
In the above expression ‘|’ indicates the concatenation of bit strings.

The same InitializationVector is associated with all the session keys (SessionKey and all
SessionReceiverSpecificKeys) associated with a specific Sender. It shall be incremented each time any
of those keys are used to encrypt and/or create a MAC.

The session_block_counter is an internal counter that keeps track of the number of blocks encrypted
with the same session key. The purpose is to ensure that a single session key is not used to encrypt
more than the configured max_blocks_per_session. The session_block_counter and the size of the
plain text shall be used by implementations of the Crypto encode operations to ensure that
max_blocks_per_session will not be exceeded during the encode operation. If the operation detects
that the counter would exceed the maximum then it should modify the SessionId and derive new
session keys prior to transforming any of the input plain text. The change in the SessionId creates new
session keys and thus resets the session_block_counter. This approach ensures that all ciphertext
returned by the operation is encrypted with the same session keys.

The resulting ciphertext will be preceded by a CryptoHeader that indicates the SessionId and
InitializationVectorSuffix.

The resulting block of bytes from the “encode” operations (encode_serialized_payload,
encode_datawriter_submessage, encode_datareader_submessage, and
encode_rtps_message) is illustrated in the sections that follow:

The receiver_specific_macs in the CryptoFooter are the AES-GMAC tags computed on the
common_mac using each of the SessionReceiverSpecificKey and the same InitializationVector.

9.5.3.3.5  Computation of plaintext from ciphertext

The decrypt operation first checks that the CryptoTransformIdentifier attribute in the
CryptoHeader has the proper transformation_kind and also uses the
CryptoTransformIdentifier transformation_key_id to locate the MasterKey,  and
MasterSalt. In case of a re-key the crypto handle (ParticipantCryptoHandle,
DatawriterCryptoHandle, or DatareaderCryptoHandle) may be associated with
multiple MasterKeyId and this parameter allows selection of the correct one. If the MasterKeyId
is not found associated with the crypto handle the operation shall fail.

The session_id attribute within the CryptoHeader is used to obtain the proper
SessionReceiverSpecificKeys and SessionKey. Note that this only requires a re-
computation if it has changed from the previously received SessionId for that crypto handle.
Given the InitializationVector from the CryptoHeader and the SessionKey the
transformation performed to recover the plaintext from the ciphertext is identical to the one performed
to go plaintext to ciphertext.

9.5.3.3.6  Computation of the message authentication codes

The message digest is computed on the crypto_header and the ciphertext.

There are two types of message authentication codes (MACs) that may appear.

•  The first stored in the common_mac uses the SessionKey. This MAC may be verified by all the

receivers of the message.

•  The second type, stored in the receiver_specific_macs contains MACs that use different

SessionReceiverSpecificKey whose CryptoTransformIdentifier appears explicitly in the

264

DDS Security, v1.1

receiver_specific_macs. These MACs use receiver-specific keys that are shared with only one
receiver. The key material for these MACs is derived from the
RemoteParticipant2ParticipantKeyMaterial, the
RemoteWriter2ReaderKeyMaterial, or the RemoteReader2WriterKeyMaterial.

9.6  Builtin Logging Plugin

The builtin Logging Plugin is known as the DDS:Logging:DDS_LogTopic.

The DDS:Logging:DDS_LogTopic implements logging by publishing information to a DDS Topic
BuiltinLoggingTopic defined below.
The BuiltinLoggingTopic shall have the Topic name “DDS:Security:LogTopic”.
The BuiltinLoggingTopic shall have the Type BuiltinLoggingType defined in the IDL
below:

enum LoggingLevel {
    EMERGENCY_LEVEL, // System is unusable. Should not continue use.
    ALERT_LEVEL,     // Should be corrected immediately
    CRITICAL_LEVEL,  // A failure in primary application.
    ERROR_LEVEL,     // General error conditions
    WARNING_LEVEL,   // May indicate future error if action not taken.
    NOTICE_LEVEL,    // Unusual, but nor erroneous event or condition.
    INFORMATIONAL_LEVEL, // Normal operational. Requires no action.
    DEBUG_LEVEL
};

@extensibility(FINAL)
struct NameValuePair {
    string name;
    string value;
};
typedef sequence<NameValuePair> NameValuePairSeq;

@extensibility(FINAL)
struct BuiltinLoggingType {
    octet  facility;  // Set to 0x0A (10). Indicates sec/auth msgs
    LoggingLevel severity;
    Time_t timestamp; // Since epoch 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC)
    string hostname;  // IP host name of originator
    string hostip;    // IP address of originator
    string appname;   // Identify the device or application
    string procid;    // Process name/ID for syslog system
    string msgid;     // Identify the type of message
    string message;   // Free-form message

    // Note that certain string keys (SD-IDs) are reserved by IANA
    map<string, NameValuePairSeq>  structured_data;
};

Knowledge of the BuiltinLoggingTopic shall be builtin into the DDS:Auth:PKI-DH
AccessControl plugin and it shall be treated according to the following topic rule:

DDS Security, v1.1

265

<topic_rule>

         <topic_expression> DDS:Security:LogTopic</topic_expression>
         <enable_discovery_protection>FALSE</enable_discovery_protection>
         <enable_read_access_control>TRUE</enable_read_access_control>
         <enable_write_access_control>FALSE</enable_write_access_control>
         <metadata_protection_kind>SIGN</metadata_protection_kind>
         <data_protection_kind>ENCRYPT</data_protection_kind>
      </topic_rule>
The above rule states that any DomainParticipant with permission necessary to join the DDS
Domain shall be allowed to write the BuiltinLoggingTopic but in order to read the
BuiltinLoggingTopic the DomainParticipant needs to have a grant for the
BuiltinLoggingTopic in its permissions document.

9.6.1  DDS:Logging:DDS_LogTopic plugin behavior

The table below describes the actions that the DDS:Logging:DDS_LogTopic plugin performs when
each of the plugin operations is invoked.

 Table 74 – Actions undertaken by the operations of the builtin Logging plugin

set_log_options  Controls the configuration of the plugin. The LogOptions parameter shall be used to take the

actions described below:
If the distribute parameter is set to TRUE, the DDS:Logging:DDS_LogTopic shall create a
DataWriter to send the BuiltinLoggingTopic if it is FALSE, it shall not.
The plugin shall open a file with the name indicated in the log_file parameter.
The plugin shall remember the value of the log_level so that it can be used during the log
operation.
This operation shall check if logging was enabled by a prior call to enable_logging and if
not it shall return without performing any action.
If logging was enabled, it shall behave as described below:
The operation shall compare the value of the the log_level parameter with the value saved
during the set_log_options operation.
If the log_level parameter value is greater than the one saved by the set_log_options
operation, the operation shall return without performing any action.
If the log_level parameter value is less than or equal to the one saved, the log operation shall
perform two actions:
•

It shall append a string representation of the parameters passed to the log operation to the
end of the file opened by the set_log_options operation.
If the value of the distribute option was set on the call to set_log_options, the plugin
shall fill an object of type BuiltinLoggingType with the values passed as arguments
to the log operation and publish it using the DataWriter associated with the
BuiltinLoggingTopic created by the set_log_options operation.

•

log

enable_logging

set_listener

This operation shall save the fact that logging was enabled such that the information can be
used by the log operation.
This operation shall save a reference to the LoggerListener such that the listener is be notified
each time a log message is produced.

10  Plugin Language Bindings

10.1  Introduction

Clause 8 defines the plugin interfaces in a programming-language independent manner using UML.
Using the terminology of the DDS specification this UML definition could be considered a Platform
Independent Model (PIM) for the plugin interfaces. The mapping to each specific programming
languages platform could therefore be considered a Platform Specific Model (PSM) for that
programming language.

The mapping of the plugin interfaces to specific programming languages is defined by first defining
the interfaces using OMG-IDL version 3.5 with the additional syntax defined in the DDS-XTYPES
specification and subsequently applying the IDL to language mapping to the target language.

IDL Types lacking the DDS-XTYPES @extensibility annotation shall be interpreted as having
the extensibility kind APPENDABLE. This matches the DDS-XTYPES specification implied
extensibility of un-annotated types.

For consistency with the DDS specification, the DDS security specification defines language bindings
to each of the language PSMs specified for DDS, namely:

•  C as derived from the IDL to C mapping
•  C++ classic, as derived from the IDL to C++ mapping
•  Java classic, as derived from the IDL to Java mapping
•  C++ modern, aligned with the DDS-STDC++ specification, this is derived from the IDL to C++11

mapping

•  Java modern with the DDS-JAVA5+ specification

10.2  IDL representation of the plugin interfaces

For consistency in the resulting APIs, the mapping from the plugin interfaces defined in clause 8 and
the OMG IDL follows the same PIM to PSM mapping rules as the OMG DDS specification (see sub
clause 7.2.2 of the DDS specification version 1.2 [1]). A relevant subset of these rules is repeated here.
In these rules “PIM” refers to the UML description of the interfaces in clause 8 and PSM refers to the
OMG-IDL description of the interfaces that appears in the associated dds_security.idl file.

•  The PIM to PSM mapping maps the UML interfaces and classes into IDL interfaces. Plain data

types are mapped into structures.

•  ‘Out’ parameters in the PIM are conventionally mapped to ‘inout’ parameters in the PSM in order

to minimize the memory allocation performed by the Service and allow for more efficient
implementations. The intended meaning is that the caller of such an operation should provide an
object to serve as a “container” and that the operation will then “fill in” the state of that objects
appropriately.

The resulting IDL representation of the plugin interfaces appears in the file dds_security.idl which
shall be considered part of the DDS Security specification.

10.3  C language representation of the plugin interfaces

The C language representation of the plugin interfaces shall be obtained applying the IDL to C
mapping [5] to the dds_security.idl file.

DDS Security, v1.1

267

10.4  C++ classic representation of the plugin interfaces

The C++ classic (without the use of the C++ standard library) language representation of the plugin
interfaces shall be obtained using the IDL2C++ mapping [7] to the dds_security.idl file.

10.5  Java classic

The Java classic language representation of the plugin interfaces shall be obtained using the IDL2Java
mapping [6] to the dds_security.idl file.

10.6  C++11 representation of the plugin interfaces

This representation is aligned with the DDS-STDC++ PSM.

The C++ classic language representation of the plugin interfaces shall be obtained using the
IDL2C++11 mapping [8] to the dds_security.idl file with the following exceptions:

1.  The IDL module DDS shall be mapped to the C++ namespace dds so it matches the namespace

used by the DDS-STD-C++ PSM.

2.  The mapping shall not use any C++11-only feature of the language or the library (e.g., move

constructors, noexcept, override, std::array).

3.   Arrays shall map to the dds::core::array template defined in the DDS-STD-C++ PSM.
4.   The enumerations shall map to the dds::core::safe_enum template defined in the DDS-STD-

C++ PSM.

5.  The IDL DynamicData native type shall be mapped to the C++ type

dds::code::xtypes::DynamicData defined in the DDS-STDC++ PSM.

10.7  Java modern aligned with the DDS-JAVA5+ PSM

The Java classic language representation of the plugin interfaces shall be obtained using the IDL2Java
mapping [6] to the dds_security.idl file with the following exceptions:

1.  The IDL module DDS shall be mapped to the Java namespace org.omg.dds so it matches the

namespace used by the DDS-JAVA5+ PSM.

2.  The IDL DynamicData native type shall be mapped to the type

org.omg.dds.type.dynamic.DynamicData defined in the DDS-JAVA5+ PSM.
