# DNS Rebind SSRF in Jira Integration

## Problem

As part of <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/engineering/issues/292> it was determined that the Jira integration is vulnerable to a DNS rebind attack. This type of attack allows an attacker to bypass our SSRF protections by returning a valid IP address during validation, and a restricted/protected address when the actual connection is made.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Setup a netcat listener on port 2345 of the GitLab server
2. Visit Project->Integrations->Jira
3. Input as the Web URL `http://rebind.gtest.dev:2345`
4. Click `Test settings and save changes`
5. Look for connection in netcat listener
   1. If a connection is not seen, revisit configuration page and save again. Multiple attempts are sometimes needed to trigger attack.

## Impact

SSRF protections are bypassed to make connections to internal services. The immediate impact seen is that an attacker can map an internal network to determine open ports based on the returned error message

## Mitigation steps

1. To reduce the ability to map ports, consider changing the error message so that there is no differentiation based on result of connection.
2. Review if it is possible to configure component to use a proxy, there is an on-going discussion of building an internal outbound proxy for all outbound connections. <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/engineering/issues/179>
3. If using 3rd party Gem/library, would it be feasible to internalize functionality and use Gitlab:HTTP?

## Additional notes

There is additional discussion happening around using a dns cacher with minimum TTL requirements DNS TTL. This would be considered a defense-in-depth measure.
