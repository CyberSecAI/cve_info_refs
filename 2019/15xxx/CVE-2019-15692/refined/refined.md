  "CVE-2019-15692": {
    "description": "TigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflow. Vulnerability could be triggered from CopyRectDecoder due to incorrect value checks. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.",
    "root_cause": "Incorrect value checks in CopyRectDecoder leading to a heap buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Potential remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network connectivity"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to specify a large framebuffer size to cause a value overflow. The peer needs to be authenticated."
