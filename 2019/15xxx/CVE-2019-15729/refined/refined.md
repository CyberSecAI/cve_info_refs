- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an internal endpoint (`:namespace/:project_name/merge_requests/:iid/pipeline_status`) on each merge request page that allows anyone with merge request access to view the last pipeline status for that merge request, even if pipeline visibility is restricted to project members only.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Authorization bypass:** The endpoint does not properly check if the user has permissions to view pipelines, leading to unauthorized access to pipeline information.
  - **Information disclosure:** Pipeline status information, which is meant to be restricted, is leaked to unauthorized users.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Unauthorized users gain access to the pipeline status of a merge request. This can reveal information about the build process, its current state (running, failed, successful), and potentially other details depending on the pipeline configuration, when this information is intended to be restricted to project members only.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - An attacker can access the vulnerable endpoint through a web browser using a specially crafted URL.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs access to a merge request within the project (i.e., be able to view the merge request). The attacker does not need to be a project member.
