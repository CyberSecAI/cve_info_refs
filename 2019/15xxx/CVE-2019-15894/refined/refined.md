The provided content is related to CVE-2019-15894.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass Secure Boot digest verification on ESP32 microcontrollers through fault injection. This involves physically disrupting the CPU during startup, leading to the execution of unverified code from flash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Fault Injection Vulnerability:** The ESP32's Secure Boot process is vulnerable to fault injection attacks, allowing an attacker to skip the digest verification step.
- **Dependence on Secure Boot for Verification:** If Secure Boot is bypassed, the system is unable to verify the integrity of the code being executed.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** Without Flash Encryption enabled, a successful fault injection attack allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Bypass Secure Boot:** An attacker can bypass the secure boot process.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  If flash encryption is not enabled, attacker can execute arbitrary code.
- **Compromised Device Integrity:** The device's security is completely compromised, allowing an attacker to potentially gain full control.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the ESP32 device to perform fault injection.
- **Fault Injection:**  The attack involves injecting faults, typically through carefully timed voltage or clock fluctuations, into the ESP32 CPU.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Physical access:** The attacker must have physical access to the ESP32 hardware.
- **Fault injection equipment:** The attacker needs equipment to perform fault injection (e.g., voltage or clock fluctuation devices).
- **Technical expertise:**  The attacker needs expertise to perform fault injection and potentially craft malicious code to execute.

**Additional notes:**
- The advisory recommends enabling Flash Encryption in conjunction with Secure Boot to minimize the impact of fault injection attacks.
- Espressif recommends updating to specific ESP-IDF versions, which include a patch to ensure that Flash Encryption is permanently enabled when Secure Boot is used.
- Workarounds are provided for users who cannot immediately update their ESP-IDF version.
- Espressif worked with security analysts from Riscure to review and harden the boot ROM code and added additional fault injection hardening features in the ESP32-S2.
