The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in Solismed version 3.3SP1. While the primary focus is on other vulnerabilities, **User Interface Redress (Clickjacking)** is listed as one of the identified vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Solismed application lacks proper application framing protections, which allows it to be embedded within a malicious page.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker creates a malicious page that includes the vulnerable application within an iframe.
- A user with an active session in the vulnerable application is tricked into visiting the attacker's webpage.
- The attacker then overlays elements on the iframe, tricking the user into clicking on unintended parts of the application leading to actions being performed on the victim userâ€™s behalf.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a webpage.
