  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve": "CVE-2019-15146",
      "description": "The provided content indicates that commit `341f12c` fixed security issues related to the MP4 reader in the `gpmf-parser` project. Additionally, issue #60 reports multiple crashes when parsing MP4 files, which were detected using fuzzing. This suggests a vulnerability existed in the parsing of MP4 files that could lead to crashes.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is related to the MP4 reader's handling of malformed or unexpected MP4 data, likely due to a too crude/vulnerable implementation.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation in the MP4 reader.",
        "Potential buffer overflows or out-of-bounds reads when parsing MP4 data."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation could lead to crashes, which can cause denial of service. There's also a possibility of memory corruption if an attacker can control the input MP4 file.",
        "attack_vectors": [
            "Parsing a crafted MP4 file."
        ],
        "attacker_capabilities": [
            "Attacker needs to provide a crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable component."
