# CVE-2019-15294

**Severity:** High

**Components affected:** Command Centre Visitor Management Service

**Versions of Command Centre affected:** Version 8.10.1038 and 8.10.1087 MR1. All other versions are unaffected.

**Reported by:** Gallagher

**Active exploitation of vulnerability\*:** No

**Description of vulnerability:** On upgrade of Command Centre, if a custom service account is in use and the visitor management service is installed, the username and password for this service will be logged in plain text to the Command\_centre.log file.

**Mitigation:** Any compromised Windows accounts must have their passwords changed and updated for all Command Centre services using the Windows services.msc on the Command Centre server. (Note: You do not need to install any maintenance release to fix this issue as the log entry is only written at install/upgrade time.)

**Maintenance releases will be available:** v8.10.1092 MR2. This version or later must be used for all future installs of v8.10 (Note: This is only required for future installs of v8.10, it is not required to be installed to resolve this issue.)

**Important notes:**

* You do not need to install a maintenance release to fix this issue, as the log entry is only written at install/upgrade time. Just apply the mitigation.
* To check if the site has been affected you should check for the following lines in all Command\_centre.log files (including any copies made with minidumps etc): Setup, Executing command line: "C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\InstallUtil" /User="[USER]" /Password="[PASSWORD]" "C:\Program Files (x86)\Gallagher\Command Centre\Bin\VMASServiceHost.exe"

*\*This indicates whether Gallagher are aware of this being actively exploited against customer sites.*

# Security Advisories

## Identifying vulnerabilities

Gallagher is committed to ensuring that we provide safe, secure and robust products to our customers. As technology changes and evolves, both our internal and third party penetration testers are constantly testing our products to find vulnerabilities.

## Maintenance release

Vulnerabilities identified as critical are resolved promptly in all affected, supported versions\* of Command Centre and a new version of Command Centre (a maintenance release) will be developed to address the vulnerability. Maintenance releases for a specific version of Command Centre are available to all licensed customers regardless of the customers [Software Maintenance](https://products.security.gallagher.com/security/nz/en_NZ/products/software/other-licenses/software-maintenance/p/INT109) status with Gallagher.

* The severity (based on CVSS score system v3.1)
* CVE identification number
* Components affected (e.g. servers, workstations, controllers)
* Versions of software that are affected
* Any mitigations
* Who the vulnerability was reported by
* Whether we are aware of it being actively exploited
