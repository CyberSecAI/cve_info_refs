## Description

OptionTree attempts to bridge the gap between WordPress developers, designers and end-users by creating fully responsive option panels and meta boxes with an ease unlike any other plugin. OptionTree has many advanced features with well placed hooks and filters to adjust every aspect of the user experience.

Build your Theme Options panel locally with an easy to use drag & drop interface and then export a functioning `theme-options.php` file for production use that is i18n translation ready, with your custom text domain automatically inserted.

And, in just a few simple lines of code, save settings to the database with a unique array ID so none of your Theme Options conflict with other themes that use OptionTree.

Also, OptionTree now takes full advantage of the new color schemes introduced in WordPress 3.8, it looks and feels built-in.

#### Theme Integration

If you‚Äôre like me, you want to know how everything works. Download and activate the [OptionTree Theme](https://github.com/valendesigns/option-tree-theme) and see first hand how to integrate OptionTree into your own project. I‚Äôll walk you through installing OptionTree and you‚Äôll get a chance to see all the various options and filters first hand and in the wild.

#### Contributing

To contribute or report bugs, please go to the [OptionTree Github](https://github.com/valendesigns/option-tree) repository.

  Documentation

## Installation

**Plugin Mode**

1. Upload `option-tree` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Click the `OptionTree->Documentation` link in the WordPress admin sidebar menu for further setup assistance.

**Theme Mode**

1. Download the latest version of OptionTree and unarchive the `.zip` directory.
2. Put the `option-tree` directory in the root of your theme. For example, the server path would be `/wp-content/themes/theme-name/option-tree/`.
3. You must deactivate and/or delete the plugin version of OptionTree.
4. Add the following code to the beginning of your `functions.php`.

   `

   /\*\*

   * Required: set ‚Äòot\_theme\_mode‚Äô filter to true.

     \*/

     add\_filter( ‚Äòot\_theme\_mode‚Äô, ‚Äò\_\_return\_true‚Äô );

/\*\*

\* Required: include OptionTree.

\*/

require( trailingslashit( get\_template\_directory() ) . ‚Äòoption-tree/ot-loader.php‚Äô );

`

For a list of all the OptionTree UI display filters refer to the `demo-functions.php` file found in the `/assets/theme-mode/` directory of this plugin. This file is the starting point for developing themes with Theme Mode.

## FAQ

Is there a demo theme I can install?

There sure is, and I‚Äôm glad you asked. Download and activate the [OptionTree Theme](https://github.com/valendesigns/option-tree-theme) and get some experience setting up OptionTree on your own with detailed directions and tips.

I get errors or a blank screen when I activate the plugin. What‚Äôs the deal?

The most likely scenario is your theme already has OptionTree installed in Theme Mode. And since the plugin and theme version can‚Äôt both be active at the same time without the sky falling on your head, your site has decided to throw in the towel. If that‚Äôs not your issue, open up a support request and we‚Äôll figure it out together. UPDATE: As of OptionTree 2.4.0 the plugin version will not conflict with the Theme Mode version if they are both 2.4.0 or higher.
