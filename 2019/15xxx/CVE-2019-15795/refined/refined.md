  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The python-apt package was using MD5 hashes for validating downloaded packages.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Use of a weak hashing algorithm (MD5) for verifying downloaded packages.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially install altered packages by exploiting the use of MD5 hashes.",
  "Attack vectors": "A machine-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user's machine and the repository server."
