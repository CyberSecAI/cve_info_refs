## Description

![@nicowaisman](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17729105?u=19fa09e1b172fb8b5ff49db51383805e2281a5bc&v=4&size=48)[nicowaisman](https://github.com/nicowaisman)opened [on Aug 14, 2019](https://github.com/ehang-io/nps/issues/176#issue-480763481)

Dear NPS,

I would like to report a security vulnerability in NPS.

There is a problem with file permission that allow regular access to write or access information that they are not supposed to.

On the file install.go, the nps file is copied to /usr/local/bin/nps or /usr/bin/nps but then permission are changed to 777 through a call to os.Chmod, allowing every user to modify the binary.

A potential attacker could replace the binary to something malicious and the next time a valid user run it, it will be executing the attacker's file.

func InstallNps() {

[...]

```
if !common.IsWindows() {
	if _, err := copyFile(filepath.Join(common.GetAppPath(), "nps"), "/usr/bin/nps"); err != nil {
		if _, err := copyFile(filepath.Join(common.GetAppPath(), "nps"), "/usr/local/bin/nps"); err != nil {
			log.Fatalln(err)
		} else {
			os.Chmod("/usr/local/bin/nps", 0777) // Wrong Permission set
			log.Println("Executable files have been copied to", "/usr/local/bin/nps")
		}
	} else {
		os.Chmod("/usr/bin/nps", 0777) // Wrong Permission set
		log.Println("Executable files have been copied to", "/usr/bin/nps")
	}

```

Please let me know when you have fixed the vulnerability so that I can coordinate my disclosure with yours. For reference, here is a link to Semmle's vulnerability disclosure policy: <https://lgtm.com/security#disclosure_policy>

Thank you,

Nico Waisman
