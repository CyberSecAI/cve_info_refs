Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-15104:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `NewThresholdConfiguration.jsp` file, specifically through the `resourceid` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the vulnerability to SQL injection via the `resourceid` parameter in `NewThresholdConfiguration.jsp`.
*  **Privilege Escalation:** A low-authority user can exploit the SQLi to create a new admin user.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** By leveraging the privilege escalation, a low-authority user can upload a malicious file via the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature of the Application Manager Plugin, leading to remote command execution.
*   **Command Injection:** The “Execute Program Action(s)” feature is vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-authority user can gain administrative privileges by creating a new admin user via SQL injection.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server by uploading and executing a malicious file.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The combination of privilege escalation and remote command execution could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers use crafted HTTP GET requests to inject SQL code via the `resourceid` parameter in `/jsp/NewThresholdConfiguration.jsp`.
*   **File Upload:** Malicious files are uploaded via POST requests to `Upload.do`.
*   **Command Execution:** The uploaded file is executed through the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Low Authority User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account with low privileges on the ManageEngine OpManager system.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the application before exploiting the SQL injection.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter**: The attacker must know the vulnerable parameter is `resourceid` in the `/jsp/NewThresholdConfiguration.jsp` file.
*  **Knowledge of the APM Plugin**: The attacker must be aware of the "Execute Program Action(s)" feature to achieve remote command execution.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects ManageEngine Applications Manager Plugin versions 12 through 14 up to build 14290.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in build 14300 and later versions.
*   The exploit involves using SQL injection to add a new admin user and then using the “Execute Program Action(s)” feature to upload and execute malicious code.
*   The exploit can be used on both Windows and Linux systems.
*   The vulnerability was published at DEFCON AppSec Village.
