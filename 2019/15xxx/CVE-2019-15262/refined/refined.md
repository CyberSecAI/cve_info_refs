Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists because the SSH process on Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers (WLC) is not properly terminated when an SSH connection is disconnected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper session management of SSH connections. The SSH process is not deleted when a connection is terminated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by repeatedly opening SSH connections, which are not properly terminated. This can lead to the exhaustion of system resources (specifically memory) due to accumulated, orphaned SSH processes.
- High system memory usage and a high number of SSH connections are indicators of compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote, unauthenticated attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish network connections to the affected device on the SSH port. No authentication is needed for the exploit to be successful.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco WLC software releases 8.5.140.0 and earlier.
- There are no workarounds available.
- The advisory includes commands (`show memory statistics` and `show login-session`) that can be used to monitor system memory and SSH connections respectively for signs of exploitation.
- Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, with version 8.5.151.0 being the first fixed release for vulnerable versions prior to 8.6.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6 (High).

The provided documents give more detail than the basic CVE description by describing the specific vulnerable versions of software, the commands to monitor for exploitation, and the lack of available workarounds.
