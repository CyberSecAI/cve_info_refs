### @StijnVrolijk **[StijnVrolijk](/StijnVrolijk)** commented [May 8, 2019](#issue-441563461) • edited Loading

If a user sets a cookie containing an object it might execute some code inside the object when unserializing the object through the `__wakeup` magic method.

This pull request attempts to prevent this by setting and getting cookies through json encode/decode. We've also provided some fallback by checking if the cookie's string contains a serialized object. If it doesn't, we still unserialize the cookie and re-set it using `json_encode`. If the cookie does contain a serialized object an exception will be thrown.

This security fix *will* break your website if objects are set in cookies.

If you are using this in Fork CMS you will probably need to update the class that extends SpoonCookie as well and change the encoding in the same way as it was done in this PR

See <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection> for example

Sorry, something went wrong.

Security release:

[#69](https://github.com/forkcms/library/pull/69)

If a user sets a cookie containing an object it might execute some code inside the object when unserializing the object through the \_\_wakeup magic method.

This pull request attempts to prevent this by setting and getting cookies through json encode/decode. We've also provided some fallback by checking if the cookie's string contains a serialized object. If it doesn't, we still unserialize the cookie and re-set it using json\_encode. If the cookie does contain a serialized object an exception will be thrown.

This security fix will break your website if objects are set in cookies.

See <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/PHP_Object_Injection> for example
