{
  "CVE-2019-15099": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Atheros 802.11ac wireless USB device driver in the Linux kernel does not properly validate device metadata.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The driver assumes that the addresses reported in endpoint descriptors from the device side are complete, and does not validate them. An incomplete address can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A physically proximate attacker can cause a denial of service (system crash). A local attacker could potentially cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).",
    "Attack vectors": "A physically proximate attacker can exploit the driver by using a malicious device that reports incomplete addresses in its endpoint descriptors. This is a local attack vector.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A physically proximate attacker is required with the ability to inject a malicious USB device to the target system. A local attacker is required when exploiting other vulnerabilities caused by this weakness."
