The content is related to CVE-2019-15806.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The ARRIS TR4400 router firmware stores the current administrator password in base64 encoding on two web pages: `http://192.168.1.1/basic_sett.html` and `http://192.168.1.1/login.html`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Exposure of sensitive information: The administrator password, albeit base64 encoded, is exposed to any user connected to the Wi-Fi network by embedding the base64 encoded password into the HTML source code of publicly accessible pages on the device.
- Lack of proper access control: The mentioned web pages are accessible without any authentication, allowing anyone on the network to view the encoded password.
- Insufficient protection of credentials: Storing the administrator password using a weak encoding method (base64) without proper access control makes it trivial to retrieve.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: An attacker can retrieve the administrator password and gain unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface.
- Complete control of the router: Once authenticated, an attacker can perform any action an administrator can, potentially leading to a full compromise of the device, network and possibly data.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attacker must be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the vulnerable router.
- Web request: The attacker sends HTTP GET requests to the specific router URLs `http://192.168.1.1/basic_sett.html` and `http://192.168.1.1/login.html`.
- HTML Parsing: The attacker parses the HTML response to locate the base64 encoded password.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local network access: The attacker needs to be connected to the same Wi-Fi network as the vulnerable router.
- Basic web request skills: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests and parse HTML.
- Scripting/programming knowledge: Some basic scripting (e.g., Python) is required to extract and decode the base64 password, although this is trivial to do by hand.
