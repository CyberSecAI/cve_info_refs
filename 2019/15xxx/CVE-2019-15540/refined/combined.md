|  |  |
|  | The CSO header (the first 24 bytes) is the follwing: |
|  |  |
|  | (gdb) p \*header |
|  | $36 = { |
|  | magic = "CISO", |
|  | header\_size = 0x0, |
|  | total\_bytes = 0xff000000000000ff, |
|  | block\_size = 0xff, |
|  | version = 0x0, |
|  | idx\_align = 0x30, |
|  | reserved = 0x0 |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | The buggy code is in filters/filter-cso/filter-stream.c. |
|  |  |
|  | To analyze the root cause of the bug we must look at the mirage\_filter\_stream\_cso\_read\_index routine before. |
|  | In the details, look at the code that computes the comp\_size field of each self->priv->parts (the snippet starts at line 100). |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Read and decode index \*/ |
|  | for (gint i = 0; i < self->priv->num\_indices; i++) { |
|  | guint32 buf; |
|  |  |
|  | CSO\_Part \*cur\_part = &self->priv->parts[i]; |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Read index entry \*/ |
|  | ret = mirage\_stream\_read(stream, &buf, sizeof(buf), NULL); |
|  | if (ret != sizeof(guint32)) { |
|  | g\_set\_error(error, MIRAGE\_ERROR, MIRAGE\_ERROR\_STREAM\_ERROR, Q\_("Failed to read from index!")); |
|  | return FALSE; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Fixup endianness \*/ |
|  | buf = GUINT32\_FROM\_LE(buf); |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Calculate part info \*/ |
|  | cur\_part->offset = (buf & 0x7FFFFFFF) << header->idx\_align; |
|  | cur\_part->raw = buf >> 31; |
|  | if (i > 0) { |
|  | CSO\_Part \*prev\_part = &self->priv->parts[i-1]; |
|  |  |
|  | prev\_part->comp\_size = cur\_part->offset - prev\_part->offset; |
|  | } |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | cur\_part->offset is a controlled field cause buf is directly readed from the input file. |
|  | It is used to set the value of prev\_part->comp\_size if the iteration is nto the first. |
|  | In the PoV file self->priv->num\_indices is 2. |
|  | The first iteration does not set comp\_size due to the `if (i > 0)` but sets cur\_part->offset to input[24:28] = 0. |
|  | The second sets cur\_part->offset = (input[28:32] & 0x7FFFFFFF) << 0x30 = (0x6161 & 0x7FFFFFFF) << 0x30 = 0x61610000. |
|  |  |
|  | Now, always in the same routine, look at the code that allocates memory for self->priv->io\_buffer: |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Allocate I/O buffer \*/ |
|  | self->priv->io\_buffer\_size = header->block\_size; |
|  | self->priv->io\_buffer = g\_try\_malloc(self->priv->io\_buffer\_size); |
|  | if (!self->priv->io\_buffer) { |
|  | g\_set\_error(error, MIRAGE\_ERROR, MIRAGE\_ERROR\_STREAM\_ERROR, Q\_("Failed to allocate memory for I/O buffer!")); |
|  | return FALSE; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | As you can see the size is taken from the header (block\_size), 0xff in the PoV file. |
|  |  |
|  | The bug is in mirage\_filter\_stream\_cso\_partial\_read when the program tries to read compressed data (the snippet starts at line 273). |
|  |  |
|  | do { |
|  | /\* Read \*/ |
|  | if (!zlib\_stream->avail\_in) { |
|  | /\* Read some compressed data \*/ |
|  | ret = mirage\_stream\_read(stream, self->priv->io\_buffer, part->comp\_size, NULL); |
|  | if (ret == -1) { |
|  | MIRAGE\_DEBUG(self, MIRAGE\_DEBUG\_WARNING, "%s: failed to read %d bytes from underlying stream!\n", \_\_debug\_\_, self->priv->io\_buffer\_size); |
|  | return -1; |
|  | } else if (ret == 0) { |
|  | MIRAGE\_DEBUG(self, MIRAGE\_DEBUG\_WARNING, "%s: unexpectedly reached EOF\n!", \_\_debug\_\_); |
|  | return -1; |
|  | } |
|  | zlib\_stream->avail\_in = ret; |
|  | zlib\_stream->next\_in = self->priv->io\_buffer; |
|  | } |
|  |  |
|  | /\* Inflate \*/ |
|  | ret = inflate(zlib\_stream, Z\_NO\_FLUSH); |
|  | if (ret == Z\_NEED\_DICT || ret == Z\_MEM\_ERROR || ret == Z\_DATA\_ERROR) { |
|  | MIRAGE\_DEBUG(self, MIRAGE\_DEBUG\_WARNING, "%s: failed to inflate part: %s\n!", \_\_debug\_\_, zlib\_stream->msg); |
|  | return -1; |
|  | } |
|  | } while (zlib\_stream->avail\_out); |
|  |  |
|  | Look at the call to mirage\_stream\_read, you can note that the size parameter is part->comp\_size, that is 0x61610000, but the allocated space |
|  | for self->priv->io\_buffer is only 0xff. |
|  |  |
|  | This lead to an Heap Buffer Overflow of arbitray size that can both corrupt the allocator metadata (in fact, later, the program crashes with an assertion failure in the allocator code) |
|  | and the program data structures in the heap. |
|  |  |
|  | In the PoV I overwrite a pointer in the heap with AAAAAAAA (0x4141414141414141) just after self->priv->io\_buffer that is later freed in mirage\_context\_create\_input\_stream (context.c:488). |
|  |  |
|  | If you run Valgrind you get the following result: |
|  |  |
|  | ==2510== Invalid free() / delete / delete[] / realloc() |
|  | ==2510== at 0x4C30D3B: free (in /usr/lib/valgrind/vgpreload\_memcheck-amd64-linux.so) |
|  | ==2510== by 0x9791D53: mirage\_filter\_stream\_ecm\_finalize (filter-stream.c:539) |
|  | ==2510== by 0x5397011: g\_object\_unref (in /usr/lib/x86\_64-linux-gnu/libgobject-2.0.so.0.5600.4) |
|  | ==2510== by 0x4E4AD3F: mirage\_context\_create\_input\_stream (context.c:488) |
|  | ==2510== by 0x4E4A9A9: mirage\_context\_load\_image (context.c:374) |
|  | ==2510== by 0x400EC2: main (driver.c:18) |
|  | ==2510== Address 0x4141414141414141 is not stack'd, malloc'd or (recently) free'd |
|  | ==2510== |
|  |  |
|  | That is a so called House of Spirit attack, a first step towards code execution. |
|  |  |
|  | My proposed fix is the following: |
|  |  |
|  | --- filter-stream\_old.c 2019-08-24 19:24:17.931003000 +0200 |

|  |  |
|  | Due to the fact that is bug can be triggered with just a call to mirage\_context\_load\_image it is also a vulnerability of the CDemu package. |
|  |  |
|  | The CDemu deamon runs as root an call mirage\_context\_load\_image so this bug, if exploited, can lead to a priviledge escalation in Linux. |
