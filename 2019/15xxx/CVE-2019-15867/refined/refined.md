Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-15867

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Slick Popup plugin had a "support access" feature that created a new administrator account with hardcoded credentials.
- The AJAX action used to generate this user lacked capability checks, making it accessible to any logged-in user, including subscribers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Hardcoded Credentials:** The username ("slickpopupteam") and password ("OmakPass13#") for the administrative account were hardcoded into the plugin.
- **Missing Capability Checks:** The AJAX endpoint for creating the admin user lacked proper checks, allowing any authenticated user to trigger it.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A subscriber or any user with a lower role could exploit this flaw to create an admin user, effectively gaining complete control of the WordPress site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Site Takeover:** Attackers could create a new administrative account on the targeted website and gain complete control.
- **Malicious Actions:** After gaining access, attackers could add backdoors, inject malware, steal sensitive data, and make other harmful modifications to the site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated User Access:** The primary attack vector is through an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- **AJAX Request:**  The vulnerability is triggered by sending an AJAX request to the `action_splite_support_access` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of the WordPress site, even with a basic subscriber role.
- The attacker needs to know the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.
- The attacker would also need to be aware of the hardcoded username and password or leverage the user creation via the vulnerable AJAX endpoint.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Slick Popup up to and including 1.7.1.
- Wordfence discovered the flaw and disclosed it to the developers, Om Ak Solutions, but the initial patch was not satisfactory.
- A temporary workaround involves commenting out the line registering the vulnerable AJAX action in the plugin's code.
- The Wordfence blog post notes that the user creation script used by this plugin is somewhat popular and is found in other plugins developed by Om Ak Solutions as well, like Contact Form 7 Spam Blocker.
