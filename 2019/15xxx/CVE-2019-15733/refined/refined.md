Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how GitLab handles invalid URLs within comments. When a user enters a comment with a markdown link that includes an invalid URL (e.g., `[Click](NotAValidaUrl)`), GitLab constructs a URL that reveals the project's default branch when hovering over the generated link.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of the default branch name even when the project's repository visibility is set to "Only Project Members." This violates the intended access control settings.
*   **Incorrect URL Construction:** The vulnerability arises from the way GitLab constructs the URL for the link, embedding the default branch name within it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can discover the default branch of a private repository simply by creating a comment with an invalid URL.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** While the direct impact is information disclosure, the knowledge of the default branch could be a stepping stone for further reconnaissance or targeted attacks against the project.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Comment Injection:** The attack vector is the comment section in GitLab issues or merge requests.
*   **Invalid URL Trigger:** By using markdown with an invalid URL the vulnerability is triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab User Account:** The attacker needs to be a GitLab user to create comments on issues or merge requests.
*   **Public Project Access:** The project must be public or accessible to the attacker (e.g., being a member).
*   **No Specific Privileges Required:** The attacker does not need any special privileges or permissions on the project.

**Additional Notes:**

* The report includes a screenshot that shows the project's settings where the repository is set to "Only Project Members", emphasizing that the default branch should not be publicly visible.
* The report also mentions that this bug occurs on GitLab.com and may also affect self-hosted GitLab installations.
