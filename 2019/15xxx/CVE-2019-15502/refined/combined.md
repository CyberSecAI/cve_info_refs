[00:00] hey guys great news there is a brand new
[00:02] teamspeak 3 crash that was just recently
[00:04] submitted to us by an awesome VIP member
[00:07] on the R for p3 Network form his name is
[00:10] kevin roark if I wrote something like
[00:12] that anyway I've got a 64 bit windows
[00:14] here and so I'm going to I'm gonna go
[00:18] ahead and just download that now
[00:21] optionally if you want to mess around
[00:23] with with the database file you can also
[00:27] download this 7-zip file that is going
[00:30] to require that you use a 7-zip a 7-zip
[00:36] archive tool to extract that so I'll
[00:40] just I'll set that up really quick and
[00:42] we'll proceed on so boom it's done
[00:45] anyway what we're gonna do now though is
[00:47] check out the whoops we're gonna go into
[00:52] our downloads and we have this here I'm
[00:59] just gonna go ahead and extract this out
[01:02] to my desktop to be able to launch this
[01:05] server and then it's also it's also cool
[01:12] to to just take the 7-zip file outright
[01:14] so we've got that all taken care of and
[01:18] what we want to do is open the the
[01:20] server file and just go ahead and launch
[01:23] the server so one important thing to
[01:25] note is that the key right here this is
[01:28] the admin key now it's obviously the
[01:30] same for everybody so so be careful
[01:32] don't I don't know just don't run the
[01:35] server at like in production I mean
[01:37] obviously it would make no sense but
[01:40] anyway let's go ahead and connect into
[01:42] our server to try to get our key setup
[01:45] right boom immediately you crash so I no
[01:49] luck there I mean you can't even really
[01:51] put your key in so I guess that's kind
[01:53] of helpless the reason I set this up
[01:56] that way though is because this is like
[01:58] a test crash server and what you could
[02:02] do with this is well just kind of you
[02:06] know just do a little bit of testing you
[02:07] could debug what the crash is really all
[02:09] about my I've honestly not done that yet
[02:13] so anyway let's say that you pull this
[02:15] out and you want to look in here there
[02:19] is this SQLite studio file and what we
[02:24] can do is or what I recommend you do is
[02:32] go ahead and let's um let's go ahead and
[02:36] remove this database so yeah I just
[02:38] click remove the database and then what
[02:40] we're gonna do is come back over here
[02:42] and close it close the server software
[02:45] so that's going to get rid of those temp
[02:47] files or whatnot so copy this and we're
[02:50] going to add a database and we're just
[02:53] gonna paste in that path oh we're
[02:57] already in there
[03:08] go ahead and get this to open boom there
[03:12] we go look at this so what we're looking
[03:16] at for this specific crash is the the
[03:20] groups Channel and then we're gonna look
[03:23] in the data so it's actually this here
[03:25] if you take a if you take a glance in
[03:29] here at this this literally is what
[03:32] triggers that crash so you could yeah I
[03:38] don't know it's it's just really funny
[03:42] the way that teamspeak uses the Qt
[03:44] framework and then you can easily
[03:46] trigger crash as I guess so a good luck
[03:48] teamspeak i hope that this gets fixed a
[03:51] big shout out to kev hero or kevin fire
[03:53] it's ke v ir oh he's on our forum and
[03:57] stay happy stay safe out there obviously
[04:01] do not do not abuse us but just for just
[04:05] kind of a proof of concept here to show
[04:08] you how someone would abuse us if they
[04:11] were going to which I'm obviously I'm
[04:15] gonna go into just a random server it's
[04:17] kind of typical and it's standard
[04:19] standard of me and uh so what I
[04:23] typically do is I would generate like a
[04:25] URL equals whoops TS sorry server and
[04:35] then I would get my I would get the
[04:42] server IP address here
[05:03] so then why I actually need to go launch
[05:12] that teamspeak server up if I'm gonna
[05:14] have that work there you go so yeah
[05:21] that's that's a perfect concept I just
[05:24] show showcase to you you can launch this
[05:26] server up and I you can send a fake URL
[05:30] you could maybe get someone to like
[05:33] click on an image or something and then
[05:37] URL link it to this site ps3 server
[05:39] which opens up the the connection of
[05:41] that server and who knows what exactly
[05:43] happens I like I said I've not debug to
[05:45] the crash someone that's good with like
[05:48] a ladybug
[05:49] I had a pro disassembler et Cie if you
[05:52] wanted to you could take a look at it I
[05:54] I really just don't have the time
[05:56] honestly to the to reverse engineer and
[05:58] trace through what exactly is going on
[06:01] with this crash but I would be curious
[06:04] though to see if there's any way that
[06:05] you can it you can kind of like do any
[06:07] any fun exciting things because that's a
[06:11] bit dangerous to just be able to send
[06:13] someone a link a URL and and click and
[06:16] then have them have them crash out so I
[06:19] I'm definitely not saying to be worried
[06:21] or anything like that I don't
[06:23] necessarily have any extreme reasons for
[06:27] anyone to be worried but still it's
[06:30] another teamspeak rash and there's a lot
[06:32] of them

You can extract the 7z file w/ 7-Zip at <https://www.7-zip.org/download.html>

The rest is self-explanatory, just launch the server matching your architecture (Windows).

Vulnerability identifier courtesy of MITRE: **CVE-2019-15502 [**[**View the MITRE entry**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2019-15502)**]**

Code:

```
> [Suggested description]
> The
> TeamSpeak
> client 3.3.0 allows remote servers to trigger a crash via the 0xe2 0x81 0xa8 0xe2 0x81 0xa7
> byte sequence, aka Unicode characters U+2068 (FIRST STRONG ISOLATE)
> and U+2067 (RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE).
```

Also, a way to fuzz this would be to generate a list of ALL characters in for example Perl/Python going down the list of ALL unicode characters and just generate a big ass file filled with these characters. Or even generate a channel list by modifying the SQLite database - then launching the server.

Hold down the arrow key until your client crashes, as it tries loading in possible crash characters. Generate up, generate down, and even mix random chars in?

Here are some example unicode fuzzing lists:

### [Generate a list of unicode characters in a for loop](https://stackoverflow.com/a/12746412)

I am trying to list use the counter in a for loop as the number of a Unicode character. To use a Unicode character in JavaScript one can either type it in as it is, or use an escape sequence like: ...

### [Huge List of Unicode Character Symbols](https://www.vertex42.com/ExcelTips/unicode-symbols.html)

This page provides a set of tables for Unicode character symbols, including emojis, emoticons, arrows, music, sports, etc.

### [Generate all Unicode characters](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Generate_all_Unicode_characters)

You can generate a table of Unicode characters in Vim to see how they are displayed by your system. This may be of interest to anyone using CJK characters. Example The following will add a table showing the characters from hex 9900 to 9fff, inclusive: :call GenerateUnicode(0x9900, 0x9fff)...

Long story short, yeah you could generate a database filled with a bunch of characters. From there, launch the database and see what happens as you load the characters into TeamSpeak.

One could possibly find another Qt crash character. You never know!

Try latest client version. There was a line in changelog that said something resembling this crash

We have just confirmed that we have secured **CVE-2019-15502** for this issue, thanks to MITRE! I listed Keviro is the main founder as I am unsure whomever else was involved. Surely if anyone else is involved in finding this, the founders could be updated.
