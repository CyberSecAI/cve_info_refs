The provided content describes multiple heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in Bento4 version 1.5.1.0, specifically in the `mp4compact` tool. Here's a breakdown of each:

**1. AP4_AvccAtom::Create@Ap4AvccAtom.cpp-88___heap-buffer-overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs within the `AP4_AvccAtom::Create` function during the parsing of an MP4 file.
*   **Vulnerability:** The code iterates through NALU (Network Abstraction Layer Unit) data, parsing length fields and incrementing a cursor. It reads a `num_pic_params` value, and then iterates again using this value. If `num_pic_params` is large and the associated data size is insufficient, the cursor goes beyond the allocated buffer causing a heap-buffer-overflow. Specifically the read at `payload[cursor++]` at line 88 is out of bounds.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the input MP4 file.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker would need to provide a crafted MP4 file to the `mp4compact` tool.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to provide an input file to the `mp4compact` tool.

**2. AP4_RtpAtom::AP4_RtpAtom@Ap4RtpAtom.cpp-51___heap-buffer-overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow within the `AP4_RtpAtom` constructor.
*   **Vulnerability:** The code calculates the size of the SDP (Session Description Protocol) text and allocates a buffer based on this. It then reads the SDP data from the stream. After reading, the code attempts to add a null terminator at `str[str_size]`, which is one byte beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a heap buffer overflow if `str_size` is greater than zero.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution by crafting malicious input MP4 files.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when a crafted MP4 file is parsed by `mp4compact`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide an input file to the `mp4compact` tool.

**3. AP4_AvccAtom::AP4_AvccAtom@Ap4AvccAtom.cpp-165___heap-buffer-overflow**

*   **Root Cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow occurs during the parsing of a payload within the `AP4_AvccAtom` constructor at line 165.
*   **Vulnerability:** The code reads `num_pic_params` and iterates through the picture parameters, reading a length for each. It reads the `num_pic_params` from the payload and then increments the `cursor`. If the cursor goes beyond the size of payload, the read operation `payload[cursor++]` at line 165 causes a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing a malicious MP4 file to `mp4compact`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide an input file to the `mp4compact` tool.

In all three cases, the `mp4compact` tool is vulnerable to heap buffer overflows by providing crafted MP4 files as input, leading to potential crashes or other security issues.
