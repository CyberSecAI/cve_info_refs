{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The API endpoint `/groups/:id/epics/:epic_id/notes` does not properly check if the group ID provided in the URL path belongs to the epic being requested. Additionally, the API discloses historical information related to an epic if it was promoted from a private project issue.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
    "Information Disclosure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can view notes from epics that do not belong to a group they have access to. Additionally, they can gain access to historical information that should be private, including milestone and label information from private projects that were associated with the issue before it was promoted to an epic.",
  "Attack vectors": "By making a GET request to the vulnerable API endpoint `/groups/:id/epics/:epic_id/notes` and iterating through epic IDs, an attacker can access notes from any publicly accessible group's epics. If the epic was promoted from an issue in a private project, more sensitive information is exposed via the API response.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the GitLab API. They do not need to have prior access to the targeted private group or project. The attacker needs to be aware of a valid epic id in order to exploit this vulnerability. They also need to be aware of the api endpoint that can be used to access these notes"
