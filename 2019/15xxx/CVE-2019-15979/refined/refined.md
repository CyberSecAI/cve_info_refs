Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-15979:

**Root Cause:**

*   Insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the SOAP API of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that a crafted request to the SOAP API can inject arbitrary commands into the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying OS.
*   **Full Administrative Privileges:** The attacker can gain full administrative privileges on the compromised device.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:**  The CVSS score indicates a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack can be performed remotely.
*  **Network (AV:N):** The vulnerability is accessible over a network.
* **SOAP API Endpoint**: The attack vector is through the SOAP API of the Cisco DCNM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative privileges on the DCNM application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the DCNM application.
*  **No user interaction**: No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Details:**
* The vulnerability is present in Cisco DCNM software releases earlier than Release 11.3(1).
* Proof-of-concept exploit code is available.
* There are no workarounds available.
* The vulnerability is related to CVE-2019-15978, which is a similar command injection vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco DCNM. Both vulnerabilities can be exploited independently, and a software release affected by one may not be affected by the other.
