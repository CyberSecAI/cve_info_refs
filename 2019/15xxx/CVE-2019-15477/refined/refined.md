Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the default error handler in the Jooby framework not properly escaping error details before rendering them in the response. Specifically, the `message` and `reason` fields of the error details map were not being HTML-escaped.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper HTML escaping in the error details allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the error response. These scripts would then be executed by the victim's browser, leading to potential compromise of the user session or other malicious actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** If the application throws an error, the error message is rendered in the response without sanitization and if an attacker can control this message it could be used to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Session Hijacking:** By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to session hijacking.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance of the web page.
*   **Data theft:** The attacker could potentially steal sensitive information displayed on the page or data stored in the browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Error Injection:** An attacker could trigger an error within the application, such that the attacker controlled string is reflected in the error message.
*   **Manipulated input:** By providing crafted input that triggers an error with a crafted message and reason that are not properly sanitized before being returned to the user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to trigger an error within the target application.
*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts in a string that will be part of the error output.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involved applying an HTML escaper to the error message and reason before rendering the error response.
* The code was modified to apply the escaping function via the `compute` method of the error map, ensuring consistent escaping across different error scenarios.
*   A test case was modified to accommodate the behavior of `DefaultErrHandlerTest#checkErr` where the content of the map is modified during the test process.
