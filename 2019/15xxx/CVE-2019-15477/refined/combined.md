[@jknack](https://github.com/jknack) Please review, especially the test case. I'm not familiar with it, i'm not sure if this line is correct:

`expect(env.xss("html")).andReturn(HtmlEscapers.htmlEscaper()::escape);`

Sorry, something went wrong.

One question about this: in the original code, the `html` and `all` cases got two different instances of the map, because `toMap()` was invoked in the `Supplier` lambda passed to the `when` calls:

```
Results
    .when(MediaType.html, () -> Results.html(VIEW).put("err", ex.toMap(stackstrace)))
    .when(MediaType.all, () -> ex.toMap(stackstrace)));

```

This is the reason I introduced the supplier. If I pass the same map instance to the suppliers in `when` calls, test cases will fail because `org.jooby.DefaultErrHandlerTest#checkErr` is invoked when validating the `html` response type view, and it removes all entries from the map, but later there is another assertation for the `all` response data which expects the size of the map to be 4.

I could either modify the test case or pass a copy of the map to the suppliers like this:

```
      Map<String, Object> details = ex.toMap(stackstrace);
      details.compute("message", escaper);
      details.compute("reason", escaper);

      rsp.send(
          Results
              .when(MediaType.html, () -> Results.html(VIEW).put("err", new LinkedHashMap<>(details)))
              .when(MediaType.all, () -> new LinkedHashMap<>(details)));

```

Got it. If you feel strongly go and modify the existing test, otherwise let's keep it

Thanks

| I modified the test case very slightly so `org.jooby.DefaultErrHandlerTest#checkErr` now works with a local copy of the map. |
