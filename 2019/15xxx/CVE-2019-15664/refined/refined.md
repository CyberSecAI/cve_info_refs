Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of an offset parameter used in a memory operation within the `KfeCo10X64.sys` driver, a component of the Rivet Killer Control Center. Specifically, IOCTL `0x120404` is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input for a memory offset. This allows an attacker to read kernel memory outside the intended bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The immediate impact is an arbitrary read of kernel memory. However, this arbitrary read is described as being part of a chain to escalate privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted IOCTL request (`0x120404`) to the vulnerable driver with a manipulated offset parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker requires administrator privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `KfeCo10X64.sys` driver.
*   The issue was fixed in October 2019, in Killer Software version 2.1.1352 or later.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) is available as part of `poc.cpp`.
*   The vendor was contacted on July 7, 2019, and the fix was published on October 13, 2019.
