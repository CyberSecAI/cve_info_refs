- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The code responsible for removing metadata, specifically EXIF geolocation data, from uploaded images was not being applied to images uploaded as part of snippets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Failure to sanitize uploaded images in snippets by removing sensitive metadata like geolocation data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Disclosure of sensitive location information embedded in image metadata to unauthorized users.
- **Attack vectors:** Uploading images with embedded geolocation data as part of a snippet.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to upload files as snippets in the GitLab instance.
