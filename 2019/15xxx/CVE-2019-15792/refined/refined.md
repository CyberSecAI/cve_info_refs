CVE-2019-15792:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: Type confusion in the shiftfs implementation. file->private_data is a void* that points to a filesystem-dependent type; and some filesystems even use it to store a type-cast number instead of a pointer. The implicit cast to a "struct shiftfs_file_info *" can therefore be a bad cast.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Type confusion vulnerability due to incorrect type casting in shiftfs_real_fdget().
  - Impact of exploitation: Local attacker could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
  - Attack vectors: A local attacker can exploit this by causing a type confusion between struct shiftfs_file_info and another struct, leading to a memory dereference at an unexpected address. This is achieved by crafting specific ioctl calls after mounting a tmpfs and shiftfs.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: Local user with the ability to mount filesystems and execute code.
