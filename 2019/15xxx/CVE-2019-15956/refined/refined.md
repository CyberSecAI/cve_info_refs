Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-15956:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper authorization controls for a specific URL within the web management interface of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Authorization:** The core issue is the lack of proper authorization checks for a particular URL in the WSA's web management interface. This allows an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized System Reset:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to perform an unauthorized system reset on the affected WSA device.
*   **Privileged Access:** The attacker can potentially change the administrator password, gaining full access to the device.
*  **Denial of Service (DoS):** The attacker can reset network configuration details, disrupting the normal operation of the device.
*   **Manual Intervention Required:** Both password change and network reset require manual intervention to restore the device to its normal state.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote, Network-based Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable device.
*   **Web Management Interface:** The attack targets a specific URL in the web management interface of the WSA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web management interface of the WSA. This means they are considered an authenticated, remote attacker.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerable URL:**  The attacker needs to know the specific URL with improper authorization to craft the malicious HTTP request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   **No Workarounds:**  There are no known workarounds that can mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates that address this issue.
* The vulnerability is rated as High severity with a CVSS base score of 8.8
*   The vulnerability was found by Sebastian Perez and Alvaro Gutierrez of Cisco during internal security testing.
