### Description

A security vulnerability exists in Zingbox Inspector that results in passwords for 3rd party integrations being stored in cleartext in device configuration. (Ref: CVE-2019-15023)

Customers still running affected versions of Zingbox Inspector software can mitigation this issue by updating to a patched version, or by disabling any 3rd party integrations configured within Zingbox Inspector where 3rd party credentials are required and stored within the Zingbox Inspector software.
