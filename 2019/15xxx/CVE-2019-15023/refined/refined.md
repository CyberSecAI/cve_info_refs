- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Passwords for 3rd party integrations are stored in cleartext in the device configuration of Zingbox Inspector.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure storage of sensitive information (credentials) in cleartext.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view plaintext credentials stored within the Zingbox Inspector software and stored configuration files. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to 3rd party integrations.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker can access the device configuration or software to view the stored credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs access to the device or its configuration files, which may be over a network.
