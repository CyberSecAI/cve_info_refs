Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `Simple 301 Redirects – Addon – Bulk Uploader` plugin contains a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated users to inject their own 301 redirect rules. This is achieved by uploading a malicious CSV file containing old and new URL pairs into the plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated CSV Upload:** The plugin allows unauthenticated users to upload CSV files, which are then processed and used to create redirects.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin doesn't properly validate or sanitize the contents of the CSV file, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary redirect rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Redirects:** Attackers can inject redirects that send site visitors to malicious websites.
*   **Traffic Hijacking:** By controlling the redirect rules, attackers can redirect all site traffic to any destination they choose.
*   **SEO Poisoning:** Injected redirects could lead to the website being penalized by search engines or having its search ranking manipulated.
*   **Spam Injection**: The plugin could be used to inject spam links into the site's 301 redirects, leading users to spam websites.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Requests:** An attacker sends an HTTP request to the vulnerable plugin, uploading a crafted CSV file.
*   **Exploitation of Nopriv AJAX action**: The vulnerability is exploited by sending AJAX requests to the affected plugins, taking advantage of the plugin's lack of authentication checks on these actions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker doesn't need any valid user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable website.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability was actively exploited in the wild, starting around July 31, 2019.
*   The plugin developers have released a patch (version 1.2.5) to address this vulnerability.
*   The exploit was part of a larger campaign targeting multiple WordPress plugins.
*   The article mentions that the malicious redirects were often to advertising networks, and were sometimes not functional, indicating either a breakdown in infrastructure or a transition.
*   The plugin was not tested with the latest WordPress major releases and may have compatibility issues.
