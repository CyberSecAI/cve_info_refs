**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-15016

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the Zingbox Inspector management interface. Specifically, unsanitized data from the web UI is passed directly to the backend database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The core vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw caused by the failure to neutralize special elements used in an SQL command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can pass unsanitized commands to the Zingbox Inspector backend database, potentially leading to:
    - **Compromise of the database:**  This could involve unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
    - **Harm to the system:** The attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system depending on the underlying privileges associated with database user or vulnerable database functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is carried out over the network.
- **Web UI:** The vulnerability is triggered via the Zingbox Inspector's web interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a valid user of the Zingbox Inspector to exploit the SQL Injection vulnerability.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker only requires low level access to the application.
