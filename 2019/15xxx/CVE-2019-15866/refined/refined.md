Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-15866

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper capability checks within the `wp_ajax_crellyslider_importSlider` function in the Crelly Slider plugin. The plugin uses `is_admin()` which only checks if the WordPress Dashboard is accessed instead of checking user roles/capabilities. This allows any authenticated user, including subscribers, to trigger the vulnerable function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The `crellyslider_importSlider` function allows uploading and extracting arbitrary ZIP files to the server without proper validation.
*   **Insecure Access Control:** The `wp_ajax_crellyslider_importSlider` function is accessible to any authenticated user, regardless of their role or capabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can upload a ZIP file containing a malicious PHP script. After extraction, this PHP file can be accessed directly via the web, leading to remote code execution.
*   **Full Site Takeover:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to a full site takeover and database compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action parameter `crellyslider_importSlider` and a ZIP file containing the malicious PHP script.
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. A subscriber account will suffice.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Registered user:** The attacker needs to have an account on the target WordPress site.
*   **Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable function and how to exploit it.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target WordPress site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Crelly Slider plugin versions 1.3.4 and below.
*   The blog post mentions that versions 1.4.7 addresses a XSS vulnerability. While this information is good to have, this is not related to the core vulnerability of CVE-2019-15866, which is an arbitrary file upload, not XSS.
*   The vulnerability was reported to wordpress.org on May 31, 2019.

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, exploitation method, and impact, which aligns with the details of CVE-2019-15866.
