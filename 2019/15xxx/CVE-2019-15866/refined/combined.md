## Description

Crelly Slider is a Free / Open Source responsive WordPress slider that supports layers. You can add Texts, Images, YouTube/Vimeo videos using a powerful Drag & Drop Builder and animate each of them. It is perfect to display your creative content in posts and pages.

[Official WebSite (with live demo)](http://crellyslider.altervista.org/)

#### User Friendly Admin Panel

Crelly Slider does not require any Coding Knowledge. With the simple admin panel you will be able to create the sliders in the easiest way. Upload images with the default WordPress interface or choose colors using the picker.

#### High Cross Browser Compatibility

Most of the animations and the transitions are written in jQuery (using the “animate” function). In this way we can assure the compatibility with modern (even Android and iOs) and older browsers.

#### Drag and Drop Builder

How can you position all the elements in to the slider area? You just simply drag them in to the desired position. Like in Powerpoint, you just have to move the object around the Slide.

#### Transitions & Animations

Foreach element and slide you can choose an in animation and an out animation using a simple selection menu. You can set the transition speeds and how long the element will take to get in and out.

#### Completely Responsive

Responsive means that the Slider will be displayed correctly in every resolution that the user will use. If the display is small (like in a smartphone), the slides and the elements will be scaled to be adapted.

#### Full & Fixed Width Modes

Using Crelly Slider you can select between a fixed or a full-width layout (both of them can be responsive). You are the designer, you own the WebSite, just choose the best for it.

Installed Crelly Slider, but it significantly slowed down my WP Admin Dashboard to a crawl.

It does exactly what other plugins fail to do:
animated sliders, with a clear back end and acceptable learning curve not overflowed by mostly unuseful functionalities and upsell tentatives.

I can say better than many premium plugins. We couldn’t fix a conflict issue with the theme I am using (Astra Pro) but I still keep using it and can recommend it.

I used it for one of my customer website which result in giving premium quality lightweight layer slider. I request to keep it free or opensource. I have not faced any issue. Simple interface.

# Arbitrary file upload vulnerability in WordPress Crelly Slider plugin.

* by [Jerome Bruandet](https://blog.nintechnet.com/author/bruandet/)
* Posted on [June 6, 2019 - 11:58pm [+0700]September 19, 2019 - 4:53am [+0700]](https://blog.nintechnet.com/arbitrary-file-upload-vulnerability-in-wordpress-crelly-slider-plugin/)

The WordPress [Crelly Slider plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/crelly-slider/), which has 20,000+ active installations, was prone to an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in version 1.3.4 and below that could allow an authenticated user, such as a subscriber, to upload PHP scripts in order to take over the site and its database.

### Reference

CVE-2019-15866

### Vulnerability

On lines 45-59 , the ‘crellyslider.php’ script relies on the (un)famous `is_admin()` WordPress function to load the ‘wordpress/ajax.php’ script:

```
if(is_admin()) {
	// Tables
	if(CS_DEBUG || CS_VERSION != get_option('cs_version')) {
		CrellySliderTables::setTables();
	}
	if(CS_VERSION != get_option('cs_version')) {
		CrellySliderTables::setVersion();
	}

	CrellySliderAdmin::setEnqueues();
	CrellySliderAdmin::showSettings();

	// Ajax functions
	require_once CS_PATH . 'wordpress/ajax.php';
}

```

Unlike its name tends to suggest, `is_admin()` does not check whether a user is an administrator or not, but only whether the WordPress Dashboard is accessed.

The ‘ajax.php’ script contains 8 `wp_ajax_*` calls that do not check user capabilities, thus allowing an authenticated user such as a subscriber to perform actions like adding, deleting, exporting or

removing sliders. But the most problematic action is the `wp_ajax_crellyslider_importSlider` called line 520:

```
// Imports a slider given a .zip in $_FILES
add_action('wp_ajax_crellyslider_importSlider', 'crellyslider_importSlider_callback');
function crellyslider_importSlider_callback() {echo 'a';
	foreach($_FILES as $file) {
		$real_output = crellyslider_importSlider($file['tmp_name']);

		if($real_output == false) {
			echo false;
			die();
		}

		$real_output = json_encode($real_output);
		if(is_array($real_output)) print_r($real_output);
		else echo $real_output;

		die();
	}
}

// Imports a slider given a .zip file path
function crellyslider_importSlider($filePath) {
	global $wpdb;

	// Clear the temp folder
	array_map('unlink', glob(CS_PATH . '/wordpress/temp/*'));

	$output = true;
	$real_output = true;

	$zip = new ZipArchive();
	if($zip->open($filePath) !== TRUE) {
		return false;
	}

	$zip->extractTo(CS_PATH . '/wordpress/temp/');

```

It will accept any uploaded ZIP file and extract its content into the ‘wp-content/plugins/crelly-slider/wordpress/temp/’ folder, which will be accessible to unauthenticated users as well.

Therefore, an attacker can add a PHP script to a ZIP file, send a `action=crellyslider_importSlider` request to the ‘wp-admin/admin-ajax.php’ along with the file and the authentication cookie. The PHP script will be accessible at ‘http://example.com/wp-content/plugins/crelly-slider/wordpress/temp/’.

### Timeline

The vulnerability was discovered and reported to the wordpress.org team on May 31, 2019.

### Recommendations

Update as soon as possible if you have version 1.3.4 or below installed.
