Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability addressed by the pull request:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability was a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the `logic.ts` file. This indicates that user-provided input was being directly included in the web page's output without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS: The application was vulnerable to reflected XSS due to unsanitized parameters. This means an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a URL, and when a victim clicks that link, their browser would execute the attacker's script in the context of the vulnerable web application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
  - Stealing user cookies and session tokens, allowing for impersonation of the victim.
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
  - Defacing the website content.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through manipulation of URL parameters. An attacker would craft a malicious URL containing JavaScript code within a parameter that is reflected back in the webpage without sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL that includes XSS payload in a parameter that is used by the vulnerable application. They would then need to induce a victim to click the malicious link.
