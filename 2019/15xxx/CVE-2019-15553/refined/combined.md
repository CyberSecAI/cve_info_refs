### Description

Affected versions of this crate caused traps and/or memory unsafety by zero-initializing references.
They also could lead to uninitialized memory being dropped if the field for which the offset is requested was behind a deref coercion, and that deref coercion caused a panic.

The flaw was corrected by using `MaybeUninit`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# `offset_of` is unsound #9

## Description

![@Centril](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?u=0a10d71e03402e41ece0e27903b24b9ae28dfcc0&v=4&size=48)[Centril](https://github.com/Centril)opened [on Jun 21, 2019](https://github.com/Gilnaa/memoffset/issues/9#issue-459353053)

With the implementation in:

```
macro_rules! offset_of {
    ($parent:ty, $($field:tt)+) => (unsafe {
        let x: &'static $parent = $crate::Transmuter::<$parent> { int: 0 }.ptr;
        $crate::Transmuter { ptr: &x.$($field)+ }.int
    });
}
```

you are constructing a `&'static T` at address `0`. This is undefined behavior because Rust may assume that you have a valid `&'static T` but you do not.

Moreover, in the old pre-1.33.0 implementation you have:

```
macro_rules! offset_of {
    ($father:ty, $($field:tt)+) => ({
        #[allow(unused_unsafe)]
        let root: $father = unsafe { $crate::mem::uninitialized() };

        let base = &root as *const _ as usize;

        // Future error: borrow of packed field requires unsafe function or block (error E0133)
        #[allow(unused_unsafe)]
        let member =  unsafe { &root.$($field)* as *const _ as usize };

        $crate::mem::forget(root);

        member - base
    });
}
```

Note that when you say `&root` you have already triggered undefined behavior because again, you assert with `&root` that you have a valid reference but you do not in fact.

See [rust-lang/rfcs#2582](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2582) and [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#77](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/77) for a discussion.

As for your comment about `// Future error`, do note that `unsafe { ... }` here does not make what you are doing any less undefined behavior. Instead, while you might not get an error from the compiler, you might get miscompilation should LLVM or rustc's behavior change.

## Description

![@Centril](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/855702?u=0a10d71e03402e41ece0e27903b24b9ae28dfcc0&v=4&size=48)[Centril](https://github.com/Centril)opened [on Jun 21, 2019](https://github.com/Gilnaa/memoffset/issues/9#issue-459353053)

With the implementation in:

```
macro_rules! offset_of {
    ($parent:ty, $($field:tt)+) => (unsafe {
        let x: &'static $parent = $crate::Transmuter::<$parent> { int: 0 }.ptr;
        $crate::Transmuter { ptr: &x.$($field)+ }.int
    });
}
```

you are constructing a `&'static T` at address `0`. This is undefined behavior because Rust may assume that you have a valid `&'static T` but you do not.

Moreover, in the old pre-1.33.0 implementation you have:

```
macro_rules! offset_of {
    ($father:ty, $($field:tt)+) => ({
        #[allow(unused_unsafe)]
        let root: $father = unsafe { $crate::mem::uninitialized() };

        let base = &root as *const _ as usize;

        // Future error: borrow of packed field requires unsafe function or block (error E0133)
        #[allow(unused_unsafe)]
        let member =  unsafe { &root.$($field)* as *const _ as usize };

        $crate::mem::forget(root);

        member - base
    });
}
```

Note that when you say `&root` you have already triggered undefined behavior because again, you assert with `&root` that you have a valid reference but you do not in fact.

See [rust-lang/rfcs#2582](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2582) and [rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines#77](https://github.com/rust-lang/unsafe-code-guidelines/issues/77) for a discussion.

As for your comment about `// Future error`, do note that `unsafe { ... }` here does not make what you are doing any less undefined behavior. Instead, while you might not get an error from the compiler, you might get miscompilation should LLVM or rustc's behavior change.
