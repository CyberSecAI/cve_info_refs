Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15799:

**CVE-2019-15799: "Incorrect access control"**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the fact that "unprivileged" users on the Zyxel GS1900-8 switch, when accessing the device via SSH, are granted the same full administrative privileges as "admin" users. This is inconsistent with the limited access these "unprivileged" users have through the web interface.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Incorrect Access Control**: The core weakness is the failure to enforce proper access control for SSH sessions. Users designated as "user" are unexpectedly granted full administrative privileges, bypassing the intended privilege separation.
    *   **Privilege Escalation**: This issue essentially allows for privilege escalation, where a user with limited permissions can gain complete control over the device via SSH.

*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker with "user" level credentials can execute any command that an "admin" user can, including:
        *   Modifying network settings.
        *   Dumping encrypted credentials.
        *   Accessing the diagnostic shell.
        *   Potentially executing arbitrary code through vulnerabilities such as command injection.

*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **Network Access**: The attack vector is through the SSH service, meaning an attacker needs network access to the device.
    *   **User Account**: Exploitation requires a valid user account on the device, even one with limited privileges.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to connect to the device via SSH.
    *   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs valid login credentials for a "user" account on the device.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   The content provides details about the discovery of several vulnerabilities.
*   The blog post details how the analysis was done by extracting the firmware, using Ghidra to reverse engineer binaries and libraries, and ultimately identifying vulnerabilities.
*   The blog post identifies a hardcoded password used to access a diagnostic menu via SSH (`CTRL-ALT-t`) which is an unadvertised functionality.
*   The post also notes that hardcoded passwords are encrypted, but the keys to decrypt them are also hardcoded in the firmware, and the author was able to decrypt the passwords by using a tool that used these hardcoded keys.
*   The blog notes that it found multiple places where the `system()` libc call is used in the firmware, but user-controlled input is not properly sanitized, which could lead to command injection vulnerabilities.
*   The author found that the encrypted passwords for admin users can be extracted and decrypted using the hardcoded key.
*   The author was able to reproduce the vulnerabilities after performing a factory reset.
