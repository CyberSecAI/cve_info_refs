### Description

A security vulnerability exists in the Zingbox Inspector that could allow an attacker to supply an invalid software update image to the Zingbox Inspector. (Ref: CVE-2019-15019)

The vulnerability allows for an attacker in a position to intercept a software update package to deliver a tampered software update package.

This issue affects Zingbox Inspector, versions 1.294 and earlier.

### Product Status

| Versions | Affected | Unaffected |
| Zingbox Inspector 1 | <= 1.294 | >= 1.295 |

### Severity: CRITICAL

CVSSv3.1
Base Score:
9.8 ([CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://cvssjs.github.io/#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H))

### Weakness Type

[CWE-20 Improper Input Validation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20 "More at https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20")

### Solution

Zingbox Inspector, version 1.295 and later.

### Workarounds and Mitigations

In the normal course of operation, Zingbox Inspector automatically updates its own software, and a fixed version of software has already been made available. No user action is required unless the software is unable to update itself. Customers still running affected versions of Zingbox Inspector software can mitigation this issue by updating to a patched version, or by explicitly allowlisting access from the Zingbox Inspector to only the Zingbox cloud for updates by using a firewall.

### Acknowledgments

Note: This security issue was found during an internal security audit performed during the Palo Alto Networks acquisition of Zingbox. The issues discovered during this process have been addressed in software updates as described in the published Zingbox security advisories.[Terms of use](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/terms-of-use)[Privacy](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/legal-notices/privacy)[Product Security Assurance and Vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://paloaltonetworks.com/product-security-assurance)[Report vulnerabilities](/report)[Manage subscriptions](https://support.paloaltonetworks.com/SupportAccount/Preferences)© 2025 Palo Alto Networks, Inc.
