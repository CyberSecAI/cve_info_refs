{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input when rendering image alt and title attributes in the Bolt CMS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into image alt or title attributes, which would then be executed in the context of an authenticated user's browser session when the page is rendered. This could allow the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information, or deface the website.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into image alt or title attributes. This input is then stored and later rendered in the application without proper sanitization.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Bolt CMS to be able to inject malicious content. This is because the vulnerability is in the admin interface. Specifically, they must be able to edit image properties or otherwise input content that results in the vulnerable attributes to be set."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was fixed by properly sanitizing the image alt/title attributes before rendering them in the output HTML. This fix is included in Bolt version 3.6.10."
