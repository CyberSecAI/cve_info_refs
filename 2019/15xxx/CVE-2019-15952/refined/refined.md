Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "template" parameter of the Totaljs CMS API. This allows an authenticated user to perform a path traversal attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The CMS allows an attacker to use `../` sequences in the "template" parameter to access files outside of the intended directory.
- **Server-Side Template Injection:** If a user can control the content of a file included via path traversal, they can inject malicious template directives. These directives are then processed by the server, leading to further exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By injecting malicious template directives into a controlled file included using path traversal, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request Modification:** An attacker intercepts the HTTP POST request when selecting a template, modifies the JSON body to include a path traversal payload in the `template` parameter, and then forwards the modified request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with "Pages" privilege.
- **HTTP Proxy:** The attacker needs to use a proxy like Burp Suite to intercept and modify the HTTP request.
