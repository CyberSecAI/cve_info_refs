  "CVE-2019-15693": {
    "Description": "TigerVNC version prior to 1.10.1 is vulnerable to heap buffer overflow, which occurs in TightDecoder::FilterGradient. Exploitation of this vulnerability could potentially result into remote code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via network connectivity.",
    "Root cause": "A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in `TightDecoder::FilterGradient` due to missing checks for zero-width rectangles, leading to potential out-of-bounds writes.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Network connectivity"
     ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send crafted VNC messages to the vulnerable server. A malicious server could exploit this vulnerability on a connecting client."
