The provided content relates to CVE-2019-15129.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Humanica Humatrix 7 application's Recruitment module lacks proper access controls, allowing unauthenticated users to access files in the photo folder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** The application directly uses a "user id" parameter and file name in the URL to access files.
- **Missing authentication/authorization:** The application does not verify if the user is authorized to access the files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An unauthenticated attacker can access all candidate's files, potentially exposing sensitive personal information. This could lead to privacy breaches, identity theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing files via crafted URLs, such as `https://[target]/sunfish5/ehrm/humanica/recruitment_online/upload/user/[user id]/photo/[file name]`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires no prior authentication or privileged access. They only need to know or guess valid user IDs and filenames. The attack can be performed remotely.
