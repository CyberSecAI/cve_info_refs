Based on the provided content, the following vulnerability information can be extracted:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a path traversal issue where the application was not properly validating the project names. Specifically, it allowed project names containing ".." or "/" characters, which could be used to access files or directories outside the intended project directory. This was done to maintain compatibility with current subprojects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The application was vulnerable to path traversal attacks due to insufficient input validation of project names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could potentially access or manipulate files and directories outside of the intended project directory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted project names containing ".." or "/" could be used to traverse the file system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to specify project names when interacting with the vulnerable application.
- An attacker could be a developer of a subproject that exploits the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix implemented in the provided content addresses the issue by preventing path traversal outside the project directory.
- The fix uses `abspath` instead of `realpath`, to prevent exploitation using symlinks.
- The commit message indicates the fix still allows some form of path traversal for compatibility reasons, but blocks traversal outside the project directory. This suggests a partial fix may still leave some vulnerability to be exploited.
- The vulnerability was present due to compatibility requirements with existing subprojects.

This vulnerability relates to CVE-2019-15520 because it details a path traversal issue fixed in a commit, which aligns with the general description of a path traversal vulnerability.
