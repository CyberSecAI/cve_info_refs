# Securing a Publicly Accessible Folder

This website contains links to software which is either no longer maintained or will be supported only until the end of 2019 (CKFinder 2). For the latest documentation about current CKSource projects, including software like CKEditor 4/CKEditor 5, CKFinder 3, Cloud Services, Letters, Accessibility Checker, please visit [the new documentation website](https://docs.ckeditor.com).

If you look for an information about very old versions of CKEditor, FCKeditor and CKFinder check also the [CKEditor forum](https://ckeditor.com/old/forums), which was closed in 2015. If not, please head to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/ckeditor) for support.

When integrating CKFinder, you will often want to give users access to uploaded files, so they can insert images or links to files into the edited content. This requires to make the folder publicly accessible, so all the files are served through the web server. If you rely on your web server to serve the files uploaded with CKFinder, you should take additional steps to make sure the files are served in a secure way.

Let us assume that you have configured your CKFinder to allow uploading of avi files. Even if the avi file is then served with a valid Content-Type: `video/x-msvideo` header, some browsers may ignore this information and perform additional checks on the raw file contents. If any HTML-like data is detected in the file content, the browser may decide to ignore information about the content type and handle the served content as if it was a regular web page. This behavior is called [content sniffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_sniffing) (also known as *media type sniffing* or *MIME sniffing*), and in some circumstances, it may lead to security issues (for example, it may open door for XSS attacks).

To avoid content sniffing, you should make sure that your server adds the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to all HTTP responses when serving files from the publicly available folder. The `X-Content-Type-Options` response HTTP header is a marker used by the server to indicate that the MIME type set by the `Content-Type` header should not be changed and should be followed. As a result, the browser does not perform any content sniffing on the received content.

The simplest way to add the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to all the responses is by creating a servlet filter, like presented on the code listing below.

```
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

public class ContentOptionsFilter implements Filter {
    @Override
    public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) {
    }

    @Override
    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
        ((HttpServletResponse) response).setHeader("X-Content-Type-Options", "nosniff");
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    }

    @Override
    public void destroy() {}
}
```

# CKFinder 3.5.1 and CKFinder 2.6.3 released

![CKFinder 2.6.3 and 3.5.1 Release](/blog/CKFinder-3.5.1-and-CKFinder-2.6.3-released/feature.jpg)

We would like to announce that CKFinder 3.5.1 and CKFinder 2.6.3 have just been released. We have also published new guidelines for securing your server against content sniffing by web browsers when using a public folder for uploaded files.

CKFinder 2.6.3 includes a security patch for the server-side part of the application, so updating is highly recommended. The security patch for CKFinder 2.6.3 was added to the PHP, ASP.NET, classic ASP and ColdFusion server-side connectors. Java version was not affected.

The issue that is resolved in the patch and the updated security guidelines was reported by [Joshua Provoste](https://twitter.com/JoshuaProvoste) as a problem related to handling files without extension, content sniffing, and various XSS issues to which it may lead. We would like to thank Joshua for his cooperation!

## [#](#updated-security-guidelines) Updated security guidelines

Before this release, the existing CKFinder documentation could lead to the impression that CKFinder can fully protect against content sniffing by web browsers. In order to clarify this and explain how to achieve a 100% secure configuration, we added a new article about content sniffing made by web browsers and recommended server configuration in order to avoid exposing users to an extra risk.

Uploading a file, both without an extension and with an allowed extension, under some circumstances may lead to XSS vulnerabilities. XSS may occur if:

* CKFinder is configured to upload files to a publicly accessible folder,
* and the web server does not send the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` headers to all HTTP responses when serving files from the publicly available folder.

With the above conditions, a malicious user may upload a file without the `.html` extension that will be rendered by some browsers like a regular HTML file. This happens due to [content sniffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_sniffing) as some browsers perform additional checks on the raw file contents.

Please take a moment to read the updated security guidelines for CKFinder and **update your web server configuration**:

* [CKFinder 3 for PHP](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckfinder/ckfinder3-php/howto.html#securing_public_folder)
* [CKFinder 3 for ASP.NET](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckfinder/ckfinder3-net/howto.html#securing_public_folder)
* [CKFinder 2 for PHP](https://docs-old.ckeditor.com/CKFinder_2.x/Developers_Guide/PHP/Configuration/Security/Securing_a_Publicly_Accessible_Folder)
* [CKFinder 2 for ColdFusion](https://docs-old.ckeditor.com/CKFinder_2.x/Developers_Guide/ColdFusion/Configuration/Security/Securing_a_Publicly_Accessible_Folder)
* [CKFinder 2 for ASP.NET](https://docs-old.ckeditor.com/CKFinder_2.x/Developers_Guide/ASP.NET/Configuration/Security/Securing_a_Publicly_Accessible_Folder)
* [CKFinder 2 for ASP](https://docs-old.ckeditor.com/CKFinder_2.x/Developers_Guide/ASP/Configuration/Security/Securing_a_Publicly_Accessible_Folder)
* [CKFinder 2 for Java](https://docs-old.ckeditor.com/CKFinder_2.x/Developers_Guide/Java/Configuration/Security/Securing_a_Publicly_Accessible_Folder)

Related CVE: CVE-2019-15891.

## [#](#ckfinder-263) CKFinder 2.6.3

CKFinder 2.6.3 contains a security patch for the server-side part of the application and an update is **highly recommended**.

In version 2.6.2.1 and older it was possible to upload files without any extension. This applies to CKFinder for ASP, CKFinder for ASP.NET, CKFinder for ColdFusion and CKFinder for PHP. CKFinder for Java was not affected. Version 2.6.3 introduces a special type of extension (`no_ext`), which allows server administrators to explicitly enable the possibility of uploading files without any extension.

We recommend to always explicitly define the allowed extensions for uploaded files and set up a secure server configuration as explained in the guidelines mentioned above.

Related CVE: CVE-2019-15862.

## [#](#ckfinder-351) CKFinder 3.5.1

In CKFinder 3 it was impossible to upload files without an extension. This feature has been added in version 3.5.1, but in order to allow such files, they must be explicitly enabled by using the special `no_ext` extension when defining the list of allowed or denied file extensions.

We recommend to always explicitly define the allowed extensions for uploaded files and set up a secure server configuration as explained in the guidelines mentioned above.
