### @nmeum **[nmeum](/nmeum)** commented [Aug 12, 2019](#issue-479859575) • edited Loading

#### Description

I believe I found a memory leak in `gnrc_tcp` which occurs during a faulty TCP handshake, e.g. by sending an ACK instead of SYN as the first packet.

#### Steps to reproduce the issue

The sample packet used below contains a hard-coded IP address, thus it is important to configure RIOT to use that IP address. Otherwise it will reject the packet. On `native` start `tests/gnrc_tcp_server` as follows:

1. Make sure the IP address of your TAP interface is `fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f01` and make sure RIOT uses `fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f02`.
2. Add `USEMODULE += gnrc_pktbuf_malloc` to `tests/gnrc_tcp_server/Makefile`.
3. Compile `gnrc_tcp_server` using: `TCP_SERVER_ADDR=fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f02 TCP_SERVER_PORT=4223 make -C tests/gnrc_tcp_server/ all-valgrind`
4. Invoke `gnrc_tcp_server`: `make -C tests/gnrc_tcp_server/`

Using `socat` send a packet to the `gnrc_tcp_server`. This will probably require superuser privileges as it creates a raw IP socket:

```
# echo rwsQf2pekYLaU+exUBBwgPDKAAA= | base64 -d | socat -u STDIN IP6-SENDTO:[fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f02%tap0]:6

```

This can be repeated multiple times. Afterwards, terminate the `gnrc_tcp_server` application by sending it a SIGINT.

#### Expected results

valgrind shouldn't report any memory leaks.

#### Actual results

Depending on how often the aforementioned packet has been send to RIOT valgrind reports a memory leak. For example:

```
==16184== 420 (60 direct, 360 indirect) bytes in 3 blocks are definitely lost in loss record 6 of 6
==16184==    at 0x483463B: malloc (in /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-x86-linux.so)
==16184==    by 0x110DC3: _create_snip (sys/net/gnrc/pktbuf_malloc/gnrc_pktbuf_malloc.c:276)
==16184==    by 0x1106EC: gnrc_pktbuf_add (sys/net/gnrc/pktbuf_malloc/gnrc_pktbuf_malloc.c:97)
==16184==    by 0x124238: _recv (sys/net/gnrc/netif/ethernet/gnrc_netif_ethernet.c:168)
==16184==    by 0x1100AB: _event_cb (sys/net/gnrc/netif/gnrc_netif.c:1425)
==16184==    by 0x124B8A: _isr (cpu/native/netdev_tap/netdev_tap.c:100)
==16184==    by 0x10FE83: _gnrc_netif_thread (sys/net/gnrc/netif/gnrc_netif.c:1329)
==16184==    by 0x499D53A: makecontext (/build/glibc-Stc26X/glibc-2.28/stdlib/../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/i386/makecontext.S:91

```
#### Impact

IMHO this is a potential DOS as it allows an attacker to consume all pktbuf memory.

`pkt` is released in each return path now, that looks right.

| Has this been tested/checked, e.g., with valgrind ?  The fix has been tested with valgrind by myself, however, I am by no means familiar with the internals of `gnrc_tcp` and would thus prefer if someone else can confirm this as well.  `pkt` is released in each return path now, that looks right.  Does this mean that you can confirm the existence of the memory leak? |

| I tried to reproduce the issue and failed.  Could you provide more details on what failed? If you enable debug in the corresponding files `gnrc_tcp_eventloop.c`, `gnrc_tcp.c`, `gnrc_tcp_fsm.c`, `gnrc_tcp_pkt.c`, … What output do you get? Does the packet get accepted or is it rejected early on? Did you make sure that RIOT uses the correct address (if it doesn't the packet gets rejected to early and doesn't reach the vulnerable code path)? Did you make sure that `gnrc_pktbuf_malloc` instead of `gnrc_pktbuf_static` is being used?  I also believe that this is fairly obvious simply by looking at the code. Or to rephrase that: Where does gnrc\_tcp release the pktbuf memory when no fitting tcb has been found? |

The final step in the Error reproduction failed on my system: `echo rwsQf2pekYLaU+exUBBwgPDKAAA= | base64 -d | socat -u STDIN IP6-SENDTO: [fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f02%tap0]:6`  failed because socat was not able to resolve [fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f02%tap0], although tap0 had inet6 fe80::e87d:b3ff:fe8b:4f01/64 assigned to it. That might be tap-device setup related, I used `sudo ip tuntap add tap0 mode tap user ${USER}; sudo ip link set tap0 up` to create tap0.  How did you setup your Tap Device?  I also believe that this is fairly obvious simply by looking at the code. Or to rephrase that: Where does gnrc\_tcp release the pktbuf memory when no fitting tcb has been found?  I think the issue and the fix are obvious, but I still want to reproduce the Issue and test the fix. Again, thanks for finding it. |

See [alpinelinux/aports#10055](https://github.com/alpinelinux/aports/pull/10055) didn't think that this would also happen on non-musl-libc based systems.
