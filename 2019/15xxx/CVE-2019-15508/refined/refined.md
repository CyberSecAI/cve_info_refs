- **Root cause of vulnerability**: When the `OctopusPrintVariables` setting is enabled, the password for a proxy configured via the Octopus Tentacle Manager might be logged in clear text within the deployment logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information exposure (specifically, the proxy password) due to logging in clear text.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized disclosure of the proxy password, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or lateral movement within the network.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers could potentially gain access to the deployment logs to extract the cleartext proxy password. This could be achieved by compromising the system where logs are stored, or intercepting the log files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to the deployment logs is required to exploit this vulnerability.
