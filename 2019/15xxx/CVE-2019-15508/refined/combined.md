## Description

In certain limited circumstances, the password for a proxy configured via the Octopus Tentacle Manager may be logged in cleartext to the deployment log.

**CVE:** `CVE-2019-15508`

## Affected versions

**Octopus Tentacle:** 3.0.8 to 5.0.0

**Octopus Server:** 3.0.8 to 2019.7.6

## Mitigation

Only customers using a proxy which requires authentication are affected. Unfortunately, there are no good mitgations for this.

## Workarounds

Unfortunately, nothing good.

Use of a transparent proxy over ones that require configuration is good practice.
