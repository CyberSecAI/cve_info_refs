## Description

[OneSignal](https://onesignal.com) is an easy way to increase user engagement. Use OneSignal to send visitors targeted push notifications so they keep coming back. It takes just a few minutes to install.

As a WordPress VIP Gold Partner, OneSignal has been rigorously tested to handle even the highest volume use cases with reliability and ease of use.

After setup, your visitors opt-in to receive push notifications when you publish a new post. Visitors receive these notifications even after theyâve left your website, thus driving re-engagement.

You can configure notification delivery at preset intervals, create user segments, and customize the opt-in process for visitors.

OneSignalâs free plan allows targeting up to 10,000 subscribers with push notifications. Contact support@onesignal.com if you have any questions. Weâd love to hear from you!

#### Company

OneSignal is trusted by over 1.8M+ developers and marketing strategists. We power push notifications for everyone from early stage startups to Fortune 500 Companies, sending over 6 billion notifications per day. It is the most popular push notification plugin on WordPress with 100,000+ installations.

#### Features

* **Supports Chrome** (Desktop & Android), **Safari** (Mac OS X), **Microsoft Edge** (Desktop & Android), **Opera** (Desktop & Android) and **Firefox** (Desktop & Android) on both HTTP and HTTPS sites.
* **Automatic Notifications** â Send notifications to followers every time you publish a new post. Or set up a reminder that gets automatically sent to them if they havenât visited for a few days.
* **Targeting Segments** â Send notifications to specific visitors based on language, number of times theyâve visited your blog, or even set up your own user attributes that you can target.
* **Opt-In Customization** â Choose when and how to ask your visitors to opt-in to browser notifications. Customize the prompt they first see.
* **Real Time Analytics** â See your notifications being delivered in real time, and watch them as they convert into visitors.
* **A/B Testing** â Try out different messages to a smaller set of your visitors to figure out which messages are more effective and then send the more effective message to the rest of your visitors!
* **Scheduled Notifications** â Schedule notifications to be delivered in the future, based on a userâs time zone, or even based on the same time of day they last visited your website.

It started of great with the videos. I dont know if its the same company. To many problems. one supports multisite and one doesnât. The one that dont support multisite is one signal. The one that do support multisite is super pwa. Super Pwa does not show where you can subscribe when you set up app.
I am sorry. Super PWA and One Signal is not the same. I will give it a shot again.

#### 1.16.9

Reverting the UI changes for HTTP switch.

#### 1.16.8

This release makes HTTP switch match the dashboard (renamed to âMy site is not fully HTTPSâ) and removes deprecation warnings for php 7.2.

#### 1.16.7

This release updates the service worker to use a 50% smaller service worker-only file.

#### 1.16.6

This release the issue where even after saving the form, the error about not completing the required fields would appear because the settings for the new page view were loaded before the previous pageâs settings were saved. Also a broken doc link was fixed.

#### 1.16.5

This release changes the notification send rate limit from at most one every 10 seconds to at most one every 1 second.

#### 1.16.4

This release removes begining and ending whitespaces from textboxes when saving. This can fix common errors like pasting the App ID, REST API Key, or subdomain (also called label) with an ending whitespace which normally causes errors.

* Update AMP helper files to be centralized instead of hardcoded inlined JavaScript

#### 1.16.2

This release updates the amp-helper-frame.html and amp-permission-dialog.html files used for amp-web-push due to permission changes in Chrome 62.

* Update readme to show tested up to 4.9 Release Candidate 2

* Lowered priority of wp\_head hook from 5 to 10.

#### 1.15.1

This release fixes a bug with the 1.15.0 release that checks the âDismiss notifications automatically after ~20 secondsâ field. The wrong field was being checked and caused a warning to appear.

#### 1.15.0

This release adds a setting for hiding notifications on Mac OS X platforms.

* âDismiss notifications automatically after ~20 secondsâ has been replaced with âHide notifications after a few secondsâ with a couple of

  choices âYesâ, âNoâ, âYes on Mac OS X. No on other platformsâ. Previously, notifications would be persisted on all platforms except Mac OS X.

#### 1.14.4

This release restores 4 missing image files in the Setup guide included in our WordPress plugin (Chrome & Firefox Push step 7, OneSignal Keys step 2).

No code changes were made in this patch.

#### 1.14.3

* Use larger sized icons for the featured image

  Notification small icons and large images previously used the uploaded image closest to size 80Ã80. For a large uploaded image with no

  resized variants, there would be no issues. But for uploaded images resized to different sizes by WordPress, this caused the smallest image

  size to be selected and look blurry. Notification small icons now use the closest available image to 192Ã192 for a sharper image, whereas

  large images use the closest available image to 640Ã480.

#### 1.14.2

* Update Setup tabâs images and text

  Clarify some steps that are typically confusing to new users setting up the plugin, like how to get the value in the Subdomain textbox.

#### 1.14.1

* Remove .htaccess file

  Apache httpd.conf configurations that donât allow custom .htaccess options will error out with a 500 if we place this file there.

#### 1.14.0

* Update semantic versioning; update minor version for new backwards-compatible functionality
* Hide Google Project Number from configuration (using one is unnecessary since we provide a default Project Number)
* Add option âUse the postâs featured image for Chromeâs large notification imageâ (see: https://goo.gl/uSDr5p)
* Lower notification rate limit from 55 seconds to 10 seconds. Countdown shows time remaining (e.g. âPlease try again in 6 secondsâ)

#### 1.13.9

* Check in missing image to SVN: admin Configuration page HTTP Permission Request modal
* Remove obsolete admin option âShow the OneSignal logo on the promptâ
* Remove unused Bootstrap CSS/JS assets
* Fix Prompt options custom language text not outputted for HTTPS sites (https://goo.gl/5Hi4HA)

#### 1.13.8

* Config page changes

#### 1.13.7

* Add rate limiting to prevent notifications from being sent too quickly; one notification can be sent every 55 seconds
* Remove Preview Popup button; users can still follow the screenshot in the section header to match their customized

  values with the window their users will see

  permission request

* Clarify âUse my own SDK initialization scriptâ â> renamed as âDisable OneSignal initializationâ
* Add a hidden page comment if users disable OneSignal initialization for easier debugging
* Our plugin is in https://wordpress.org/plugins-wp but not https://wordpress.org/plugins. Hopefully resubmitting the

  plugin fixes it

#### 1.13.5

* Fix undefined index gcm\_sender\_id error
* Do not resend notifications for posts restored from trash

#### 1.13.4

  inline script to be run from an external script file

#### 1.13.3

* A user reported the âprompt\_auto\_accept\_titleâ variable being undefined and causing issues with her site. This issue

* The meta box checkbox âSend post on notification publishâ now correctly *does not* send a notification if unchecked.

  Previously, there was a logic bug where users could check the box, initially save the post without publishing, and

  have a notification sent out when later publishing.
* The default plugin tab is now âSetupâ if the user is setting up for the first time, and if their App ID or REST API
