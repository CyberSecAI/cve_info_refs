Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the OneSignal WordPress plugin. Specifically, the 'subdomain' parameter received via a POST request is not properly sanitized before being displayed back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent (stored) XSS. This occurs because unsanitized user input is stored and later rendered in a user's browser, enabling malicious script execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the 'subdomain' parameter. When an administrator views the OneSignal plugin settings page, the malicious code will execute within their browser session, in the context of the affected WordPress site. This could potentially allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Modify the content of the page displayed to the admin.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator, potentially compromising the entire site.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **POST Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a malicious POST request to the WordPress admin page (`admin.php?page=onesignal-push`).
- **'subdomain' Parameter:** The payload containing malicious code is embedded within the 'subdomain' parameter of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, with sufficient privileges to access the OneSignal plugin settings page within the WordPress admin panel.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable 'subdomain' parameter and its usage within the application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in version 1.17.5 of the OneSignal WordPress plugin.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) code demonstrates how to construct a malicious POST request.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2019-15827.
- This vulnerability is classified as a stored/persistent XSS.
