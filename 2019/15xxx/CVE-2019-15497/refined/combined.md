# CVE 2019-15497 Default Credentials

[August 23, 2019](https://experiencesofasysadmin.wordpress.com/2019/08/23/cve-2019-15497-default-credentials/) ~ [Frank Barton](https://experiencesofasysadmin.wordpress.com/author/fbarton274531937/)

## Summary

Default credentials in BlackBox iCompel and ONELAN Net-Top-Box allow remote attackers to remotely access these devices with administrator and root level access.

These devices are used as digital signage solutions

## Impacted Products

* iCompel units with product versions 9.2.3 though 11.1.4 are confirmed to be vulnerable
* OneLAN net-top-box units share a code-base with iCompel. Versions 9.2.3 through 11.1.4 were acknowledged to also be vulnerable to this

## Details

Multiple default username and password combinations are present on the systems in their default state. These include:

* ‘root’ – accessible via SSH – provides root level access to the base linux system
* ‘remote’ – accessible via HTTP, HTTPS, & FTP – provides system level access to the iCompel/NTB system
* ‘maint’ – accessible only via local console – provides access to factory reset system including security configurations
* ‘chef’, ‘clerk’, ‘foyer’ – accessible via HTTP/HTTPS, & FTP – provides access to update & edit content displayed

## Workarounds

* Change all default credentials
* Prevent physical access to devices
* Segment devices to prevent network access
* Disable or remove unneeded accounts
* Disable unneeded protocols

## Additional Information

* Devices are capable of auto-update to new system versions. This functionality does not appear to be enabled by default
* Devices run Fedora Linux
* As of 2019-05, over 600 devices were detected as being online, and publicly accessible by Shodan
