- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Default credentials present in BlackBox iCompel and ONELAN Net-Top-Box devices.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Multiple default username and password combinations exist, granting various levels of access including root access via SSH, system level access via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP, and access to modify content.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can gain unauthorized access to the devices, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, and manipulation of displayed content.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote access via SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols. Local access via the console for factory reset.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Network access to the devices. No authentication is needed using the default credentials.
