{
  "CVE-2019-15145": [
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a missing zero-byte check in the `JB2Dict::JB2Codec::get_direct_context` function within `libdjvu/JB2Image.h`, which leads to an out-of-bounds read.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds read.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) via an out-of-bounds read.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a corrupted JB2 image file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted JB2 image file as input to an application that uses the vulnerable library."
    },
    {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a recursive call to `GArrayTemplate<Run>::sort` within `GContainer.h`. This can result in a stack overflow when handling a crafted PBM image file.",
       "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Uncontrolled recursion leading to stack overflow.",
       "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash) through stack overflow.",
       "Attack vectors": "By crafting a specific PBM image file that triggers uncontrolled recursion.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted PBM image file as input to an application that uses the vulnerable library."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to an infinite loop in `GBitmap::read_rle_raw` function, related to `libdjvu/DjVmDir.cpp` and `libdjvu/GBitmap.cpp`",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Infinite loop causing resource exhaustion.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service error through resource exhaustion, leading to application hang.",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a corrupted image file that triggers the infinite loop.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide the crafted image file as input to an application that uses the vulnerable djvulibre library."
    },
        {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a heap-based buffer over-read in `GStringRep::strdup` function within `libdjvu/GString.cpp`.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer over-read.",
      "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can cause a denial-of-service (application crash).",
      "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malformed DJVU file that triggers the over-read.",
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted DJVU file as input to an application that uses the vulnerable djvulibre library."
