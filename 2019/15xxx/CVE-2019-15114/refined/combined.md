Without any indication my 2 forms were deleted, I recreate the form after noticing and now the Shortcode does not show the Form. There are many better free alternatives

It’s a good and easy to use plugin for forms. In its free version it also has the option of the entries shown in WordPress dashboard. If you get it premium, you can also make surveys, get more nice looking templates and more add-ons like Stripe, email providers integrations and it also has SMTP feature. I don’t like that the new add-ons come with a new plugin though…

Seeing many attempts at accessing our site from varying i/p addresses by way of this plugin which we do not have installed.
3:22 pm plugins/formcraft/file-upload/server/content/upload.php
WP-CERBER is doing it’s job, but I’ve seen 3 different i/p address try and access this file.
Is your plugin a backend for site attacks?

Why you are not updating the plugin more frequently? You know that rings some bells and prevents you from gaining more users. Other than that, this is an awesome plugin.
