         "vulnerability": "This commit fixes CVE-2019-15226 by introducing a cached byte size in HeaderMap. The value is stored as an optional and cleared when a non-const pointer or reference to a HeaderEntry is accessed. The cached value can be set with refreshByteSize() which iterates over the HeaderMap summing the size of each key and value. This addresses the issue where the byte size count can become inaccurate if HeaderEntries are modified directly by reference.",
         "root_cause": "The HeaderMap did not accurately track its byte size when HeaderEntries were accessed and modified by reference, leading to potential discrepancies.",

        "impact": "Potential inconsistencies and errors due to an inaccurate header size calculation.",
         "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is not directly exploitable through an attack vector, it's more a case of incorrect accounting within the header map implementation.",

         "vulnerability": "The commit introduces a cached byte size in the `HeaderMap`, which is updated internally. The cached value is cleared when a non-const pointer or reference to a `HeaderEntry` is accessed. The `refreshByteSize()` method iterates over the `HeaderMap` to sum the size of each key and value to update the cached size.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Inaccurate byte size calculation in `HeaderMap` due to direct access and modification of `HeaderEntry` by reference.",
            "Potential for miscalculation when headers are modified via non-const references or pointers."
        ],
         "impact": "The issue leads to potential discrepancies in byte size calculations if the internal state is not kept in sync with the actual size. This could lead to issues in downstream processes that rely on the header size.",
