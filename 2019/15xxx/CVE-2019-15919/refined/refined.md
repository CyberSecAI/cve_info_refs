## CVE-2019-15919

The provided information relates to CVE-2019-15919.

The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Linux kernel's CIFS (Common Internet File System) implementation, specifically within the `SMB2_write` function in `fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c`.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is releasing the `req` buffer too early in the `SMB2_write` function, specifically when ftrace tracepoints are enabled. The `req` buffer is released via `cifs_small_buf_release(req)` before it is used in tracing.

**Vulnerability:**

*   **Type:** Use-after-free
*   **Location:** `fs/cifs/smb2pdu.c` in the `SMB2_write` function.

**Impact:**

*   **Exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to a system crash or potentially other undefined behavior due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by performing SMB2 write operations.
*   The attacker needs to have the capability to trigger SMB2 write operations on a CIFS server.

**Required Capabilities:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trigger SMB2 write operations.
*   Ftrace needs to be enabled.
