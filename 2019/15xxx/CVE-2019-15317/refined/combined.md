# WordPress Plugin Give – Stored XSS for Donors

  [![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dceef4126f82373fb765ef9d57ed939d?s=60&d=mm&r=g)](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/antony-garand)   [Antony Garand](https://blog.sucuri.net/author/antony-garand)

 ![WordPress Vulnerability](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/vulnerability-discovery_blog.png)

**Exploitation Level:** Medium / Remote

**DREAD Score:** 6.6

**Vulnerability:** Stored XSS on an administrative page

**Patched Version:** 2.4.7

​​[Give](https://wordpress.org/plugins/give/) is a WordPress plugin which allows users to setup a donation page on a website. It currently has 60k installs.

​​During a recent audit of the plugin, we found a severe vulnerability which allows donors to inject arbitrary code on an administrative page.

​​If you are using a version lower than **2.4.7,** you should update immediately.

> Note: A forced update was pushed by the developers, and all affected users should now be patched and protected against this vulnerability.

​​When creating a donation, all of the arguments are sanitized as text fields, but this method does not take into consideration where the variables are reflected. Thanks to this oversight, a malicious user can still perform an injection on the donors page after making a donation.

​​Due to the reflection point, the injection can only be seen by users with sufficient permissions to see the donors — this means that a malicious script could do a lot of damage while acting as these users.

## **​​Timeline**

* ​​**2019-05-03**: Initial disclosure to Give
* ​​**2019-05-07**: Partial patch released (2.4.6)
* ​​**2019-05-10**: Notified vendor of possible bypasses
* ​​**2019-05-14**: Complete patch released (2.4.7)
* **2019-05-21**: Patch pushed to all customers via auto-update

## **​​Technical Details**

​​When processing a donation, the plugin recursively sanitizes every POSTed variable using the [sanitize\_text\_field](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/sanitize_text_field/) method.

![​​The function handling the donation form](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image4-1-600x218.png)

​​The function handling the donation form

![​​The function recursively cleaning text fields](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image2-4-600x147.png)

​​The function recursively cleaning text fields

​​Under this plugin, a **Donation** uses multiple data structures:

* ​​**Donation**, which contains the donation content itself.

* **Donor**, which contains the data related to the user performing the donation.

​​​​If the user performing the donation is a guest, meaning this is the first donation using this email, a new donor will be created with the provided information.

![​​Donor creation](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image3-3-600x143.png)

​​Donor creation

​​Under the admin panel, you can see either one of the two created entities by the donation: The **Donors** and The **Donations**.

​​Both of these pages are tables where we can see, filter, and modify the data. On the Donors table, few custom attributes are added on tags to facilitate the website interactivity. Among these is the *data-name* attribute, which has the donor name value. As you can see on the donor creation code, this value is the full name of the donor. This attribute is used on two tags: The row tag and the column checkbox input.

​​The code can be found under *class-donor-table.php:*

![​​Injection on the table row tag](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image5-1-600x90.png)

​​Injection on the table row tag

![​​Injection on the column checkbox](https://blog.sucuri.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image1-5-600x123.png)

​​Injection on the column checkbox

​​The name of our user was sanitized using the *sanitize\_text\_field* method, which performs the following actions per the [WordPress documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/sanitize_text_field/):

* ​​Checks for invalid UTF-8

* ​​Converts single < characters to entities

* ​​Strips all tags

* ​​Removes line breaks, tabs, and extra whitespace

* ​​Strips octets

​​You might notice it removes the ***tags***, but it does not mention being safe as ***attribute.*** ​​With that in mind, it is possible to escape the *data-name* attribute and add an event on the input.

​Having the following name:

```
Name " onfocus="alert(document.domain)" autofocus="
```

gives us the following HTML on the input injection:

```
<input class="donor-selector" type="checkbox" name="donor[]" value="1"

  data-name="Name "

  onfocus="alert(document.domain)"

  autofocus="" />
```

Using the autofocus attributes will trigger the onfocus event without user interaction, which can execute malicious code.

## Conclusion

Cross-site scripting ([XSS](https://blog.sucuri.net/2016/04/what-is-an-xss-vulnerability.html)) is a widespread vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious content into a site.

In the case of Stored XSS (as seen with this particular vulnerability), the payload is stored in the site’s database and retrieved with every page request. If left unpatched, it can be very dangerous, as an attacker acting as a donor can obtain complete control of the browser environment.

To protect against this vulnerability, we strongly encourage **Give** users to update to **version 2.4.7** as soon as possible. In the event that you can’t immediately update your plugin, you can leverage the [Sucuri Firewall](http://sucuri.net/website-firewall/stop-website-attacks-and-hacks) or equivalent technology to virtually patch the vulnerability.

## Description

**[GiveWP](https://go.givewp.com/home "Visit the GiveWP website")** is the highest rated, most downloaded, and best supported donation plugin for WordPress. Whether you need a simple donate button or a powerful donation platform optimized for online giving, GiveWP is right for you.

Transform the way you accept online donations, starting for free. With GiveWP you can accept gifts for charity or for other purposes, through customizable donation forms. Our donation plugin also allows you to view donor data and fundraising reports, manage donors, and integrate with a wide variety of third-party gateways and services.

### ✨ GiveWP Features

GiveWP is free and full of many advanced features to suit your needs. Start by choosing one of our donation form templates to create your first fundraising campaign. Then, take advantage of full-featured fundraising reports and donor management tools to increase your overall fundraising revenue by learning what makes donors donate.

Free donor tools also help keep your donors happy. The donor dashboard helps your donor base easily manage their accounts and access their donation history. With our [premium add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons "See all our Premium Add-ons"), you can add additional donor tools, like annual receipts.

**[Powerful Donation Forms](https://go.givewp.com/features-forms "See how powerful our fundraising forms can be")**

GiveWP has taken inspiration from Gutenberg blocks to create an even better form-building experience. The Visual Donation Form Builder uses sections and blocks to provide a more intuitive way to build and configure your donation forms.

In this builder, you’ll see your design in real time. Watch as your form takes shape as you select custom colors, fields, elements, and more. For those with a flair for customization, you can add Custom CSS directly into the builder.

* Build custom donation forms in your WordPress admin
* Customize donation form templates without any code
* Add goals, multiple giving amounts, custom amounts, terms and conditions and more with just a couple clicks

Never used blocks before? No worries – [we’ve got you covered with our guide](https://go.givewp.com/visual-builder).

**[Actionable Fundraising Reporting](https://go.givewp.com/features-reports "See our gorgeous and helpful reports dashboards")**

* Get a detailed breakdown of your donation activity
* Control your fundraising data with exports and reports
* Filter reports by date, form, and payment method
* Measure performance across multiple campaigns

**[Complete Donor Management](https://go.givewp.com/features-donor-management "See how our donor management tools help you enhance donor loyalty")**

* View a complete history of your donor activity
* Generate tax-deductible receipts
* Allow donors to view their donation history, update their profile, manage their recurring donations, and download PDF receipts through their own donor dashboard

In addition to nonprofit organizations, GiveWP is widely used for individual or creative purposes. We’ve seen tip jars for blogs or musicians, live streams, and more. Our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce Add-on](https://go.givewp.com/wooread) is even used in some eCommerce stores to collect donations for a cause, or ask for tips in the cart or checkout.

### 💝 Simple and Pain-Free Giving

We built GiveWP to be the best WordPress donation plugin from day one. Simply install and activate the plugin to get started.

The strength of GiveWP lies within its optimized donation forms. When creating a form, you can start with a template and customize the donation levels, including allowing donors to give a custom amount. The donation forms can then be displayed anywhere on your website using a block, shortcode, widget, or the single donation form page.

You can also integrate your forms with a wide variety of payment processors, including PayPal and Stripe within the free plugin. You can also purchase add-ons to use Authorize,net, Bitpay, Square, and more.

### 🌱 First Time Users

For new users, we suggest reviewing our [Getting Started Guide](https://go.givewp.com/rmgettingstarted "Visit the GiveWP Getting Started Guide") to get an understanding of how the plugin works. If you run into any trouble, we offer [free support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give "Visit the GiveWP support page on WordPress.org") to help you with your issues, questions, and concerns.

### 💳 Accept Credit Card Donations and More

GiveWP comes with several payment gateway options:

* **Stripe Donations** — Accept donations through any payment method (like Apple Pay, Google Pay, or ACH) activated in your Stripe accounts. Upgrade to the [Premium Stripe](https://go.givewp.com/addon-stripe) add-on to remove the 2% fee for one-time donations processed through Stripe.
* **PayPal Donations** — Allow worldwide donations with PayPal Donations. No additional fees applied.
* **Venmo Donations** — Give donors the option to pay through Venmo with their account balance or connected bank account.
* **Offline Donations** — Enable your donors to send checks or physical donations with an offline gateway with instructions.
* **Test Gateway** — use the Test Gateway to see exactly how your donors will walk through the donation process.
* **And many more Gateways** – View additional payment gateways on our website. These include Authorize.net, Bitpay, Square, Razorpay, Paytm, and more.

## Installation

#### Minimum Requirements

* WordPress 6.5 or greater
* PHP version 7.2 or greater
* MySQL version 5.7 or greater
* MariaDB version 10 or later
* Some payment gateways require fsockopen support (for IPN access)

#### Automatic installation

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of GiveWP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click “Add New”.

In the search field type “GiveWP” and click Search Plugins. Once you have found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.

#### Manual installation

The manual installation method involves downloading our donation plugin and uploading it to your server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

#### Updating

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.

## FAQ

### Where can I learn more about how to use GiveWP?

We have extensive documentation on installing and configuring GiveWP [on our website](http://bit.ly/WPORGDocs). We suggest starting with the [GiveWP 101 article](https://go.givewp.com/give-101).

### How can I get support for GiveWP?

We work hard to the best support possible for GiveWP. The [WordPress.org Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/give) is used for free community based support. We continually monitor the forum and do our best to ensure everyone gets a response.

[Priority support](https://go.givewp.com/support) is given to users who have an active license for one of GiveWP’s [Add-ons](https://go.givewp.com/addons) or [Pricing Plans](https://go.givewp.com/pricing). We provide email-based support to our Premium Add-on customers with an average 1st response time of 2 to 4 hours and average time to resolution of 24-48 hours depending on the severity of the issue.

### Do you have any demos?

Yes! We have several live examples of GiveWP and the wide variety of form options you can use with GiveWP. Check out our [live demo](https://go.givewp.com/demosite), where you can see what your donors would see.

GiveWP Plus, Pro, and Agency Plan customers will also get a free 30-minute website audit with our Customer Success Team after they purchase. In this meeting, we’ll cover everything you need to know about GiveWP to fit your needs.

### Do you have Case Studies of Nonprofits using GiveWP?

Yes! We have two different types of studies that highlight nonprofits in different ways.

“GiveWP Stories” are stories of how nonprofits or individuals implemented GiveWP with success. [You can read them all here](https://go.givewp.com/stories).

“Case Studies” are more detailed examples of how an agency implemented GiveWP for a specific purpose for an organization. [You can read those here](https://go.givewp.com/case-studies).

### How is GiveWP better than a simple PayPal donate button?

PayPal donate buttons take your users off-site, which can cause you to lose some in the process. With GiveWP, your donors can stay on-site and you get the benefit of gathering donor data, viewing free fundraising reports, and creating unlimited donation forms. On the other hand, you can always use GiveWP as a simple customized PayPal donate button if you prefer.

### How is GiveWP better than a form plugin for accepting donations through WordPress?

Form plugins are excellent solutions for general intake forms. That said, they most often lack substantial donation reporting features, and donor management options. They also lack a variety of presentation options like GiveWP has for embedding your forms in different places throughout your site. If you want a “Donate Now!” button in the header of your site that opens in a modal, you’ll most often have to do quite a bit of customization to get that working just right with form plugins — but not with GiveWP.

GiveWP works great alongside all the most popular form plugins. Use GiveWP for donations, and Caldera Forms, Ninja Forms, Gravity Forms or other for your general purpose intake forms. They’ll work great alongside each other.

### How is GiveWP better than an eCommerce plugin for accepting donations on WordPress?

We built GiveWP specifically to overcome many of the hurdles you have to go through in order to get an eCommerce plugin (like WooCommerce) to be streamlined for donations. You want to treat your donors right. No donor wants to add their donation to a cart and go through several page refreshes just to type in their information. You, as the site admin, don’t want to have to change the word “Products” to “Donations” everywhere, and go through all the hoops of removing taxes and shipping, either.

On top of that, customizing the plugin’s terminology is a daunting task. You never want your users to receive an “invoice” for the donation “product” they “purchased.” Rather, you’d like for them to receive a receipt for the donation they gave.

Use GiveWP for donations, and let your WooCommerce or WP eCommerce plugin or the like handle your products. They work alongside each other just fine. Your donors will be happy, your customers will be happy, and so will you.

Additionally, you can use our [Donation Upsells for WooCommerce](https://go.givewp.com/addon-upsells/) GiveWP add-on to allow your customers to do a donation upsell in the cart or checkout.

### How do I eliminated the 2% fee on Stripe donations?

The 2% fee on Stripe donations only applies to donations taken via our free Stripe integration in GiveWP Core. If you purchase the premium Stripe add-on you will not have any additional fees at all. Additionally, even with the free Stripe plugin, the fees only apply to one-time donations, never to recurring donations.

[Read our release announcement](https://go.givewp.com/version2-5) for all the details, and if you have further questions feel free to reach out via [our contact page](https://go.givewp.com/contact).

### How can I report security bugs?

You can report security bugs through the Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program. The Patchstack team help validate, triage and handle any security vulnerabilities. [Report a security vulnerability.](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/give)

Having used all the larger donation platforms out there with our clients, it great to find a viable alternative that integrates seamlessly with WordPress.
Support is also good, even when using the free version..

What a great set of plug-ins. The extensions like fee recovery, invoices and recurring donations are well worth the money. They are fairly easy to install and configure. With the new form builder, anyone can get started. But if you run into minor ambiguities it’s helpful to have a company there for you. That is certainly the case here. Fast support, professional answer and you are online in no time. It’s a top team with a top solution!

Setting up Give is easy; however, I’m experiencing the error it is giving me ->>A problem has occurred with the connection between this site and PayPal, preventing donations. Please contact site administrators if reloading the page does not fix the issue.<<-. This is usually the result of some JavaScript conflict on the page. I have also deactivated and reactivated all plugins to see if there was a conflict; nothing. I also checked my PHP version, and it is current. Also, I do not know how to remove my email that is grayed out under email section; It will not allow me to remove it. Any help I can get is so much appreciated. Thank you in advance.
