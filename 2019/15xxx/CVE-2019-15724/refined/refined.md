- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating a label description.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: HTML Injection. The label description is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject HTML tags into the tooltip.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious content such as images, links, and input forms. This could potentially be escalated to a stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating a new label with a malicious HTML payload in the description.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to create labels within a project, assign labels to issues and/or merge requests, and hover over the labels on the issue list page to trigger the tooltip.
