fix for warning:

```
pdf_print.cc:1223:6: warning: ‘sprintf’ writing a terminating nul past the end of the destination [-Wformat-overflow=]
 void pdf_print::file_xref()
      ^~~~~~~~~
pdf_print.cc:1238:13: note: ‘sprintf’ output between 21 and 28 bytes into a destination of size 20
     sprintf (tstring, "%010d %05d %c \n", u->byte_offset, u->generation, u->use);
     ~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

```

Sorry, something went wrong.
