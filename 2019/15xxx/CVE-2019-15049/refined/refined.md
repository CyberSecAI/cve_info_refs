The provided content describes two distinct heap-buffer-overflow vulnerabilities in Bento4 version 1.5.1.0, specifically:

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow in the `AP4_BitReader::SkipBits` function.
*   **Weakness:** The `SkipBits` function at `Ap4Utils.cpp:548` attempts to skip bits by manipulating a bit cache and a position within a buffer.  A crafted input can cause it to read beyond the allocated buffer. Specifically the issue occurs when `m_BitsCached` is set to 0 in line 547, which is when the cache needs to be refilled. If this occurs and there are not enough bits remaining in the buffer, a read will occur outside of the bounds.
*   **Impact:** A heap-based buffer overflow which can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted MP4 file using the `mp42aac` tool.
*  **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to the `mp42aac` tool.
*   **More Detail:** The provided crash report includes a stack trace showing the execution flow leading to the overflow, starting from the `AP4_BitReader::SkipBits` function and going through various Bento4 components like `AP4_Dac4Atom`, `AP4_AtomFactory`, `AP4_ContainerAtom`, `AP4_SampleEntry` and eventually to the `main` function.  It also shows the exact memory address where the overflow happened and the region that was allocated and what was around the buggy address.

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** A heap-buffer-overflow in the `AP4_Dec3Atom::AP4_Dec3Atom` function.
*   **Weakness:** The `AP4_Dec3Atom` constructor at `Ap4Dec3Atom.cpp:97` improperly parses data related to sub-streams, specifically when `num_dep_sub` is non-zero. It attempts to read channel location data using `payload[2]` and `payload[3]` without sufficient bounds checking. If `num_dep_sub` is set to a value that causes it to read past the end of the payload.
*   **Impact:** A heap-based buffer overflow that can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack vector:** Processing a specially crafted MP4 file using the `mp42aac` tool.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to the `mp42aac` tool.
*   **More Detail:** The crash report shows the stack trace leading to the crash within the constructor of `AP4_Dec3Atom`. It also shows the memory address of the overflow and nearby memory regions. This trace includes calls through `AP4_AtomFactory`, `AP4_ContainerAtom`, `AP4_SampleEntry`, and `AP4_EncaSampleEntry`.

Both vulnerabilities are triggered by using the `mp42aac` tool with a malicious crafted MP4 file. They both result in a heap-buffer-overflow.
