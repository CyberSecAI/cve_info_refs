- In severe cases, the attacker could potentially gain full control over the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector is not detailed in the provided content, but it would involve manipulating data that is used in SQL queries within the Alfresco Android application. This could possibly be achieved via a malicious server response when the application interacts with the Alfresco backend, or through other means of manipulating data used in the app's SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious SQL code into the application's data flow.
- The attacker would need some understanding of the application's data handling in order to identify where to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates that a fix for this vulnerability was implemented in commit `0b1fb6f` and included in release `1.8.7` of the Alfresco Android App.
- The commit message clearly states "ANDROID-779 Fix SQL injection vulnerability exposed in veracode report".
- The provided Jira link also confirms that the fix is related to the SQL Injection Vulnerability.
