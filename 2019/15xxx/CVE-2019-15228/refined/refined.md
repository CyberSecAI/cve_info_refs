Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-15228:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Create Blocks" section of the FuelCMS Admin console. Specifically, the "Name" field allows the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected XSS. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the "Name" field of a block, which is then executed in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cookie Stealing:** Successful exploitation can lead to the theft of user cookies, potentially allowing an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user.
- **Malicious Actions:**  Beyond cookie theft, the injected JavaScript could be used to perform other malicious actions such as:
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Defacing the website
  - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the "Create Blocks" functionality in the Admin console of FuelCMS.
- An attacker crafts a malicious XSS payload and enters it into the "Name" field when creating a new block.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access (Potentially):**  The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has an authenticated account on the FuelCMS admin console. However, it's also mentioned that the vulnerability "can also impact unauthenticated visitors," which might indicate that the XSS can be triggered even by a user who isn't logged in.  The details of this unauthenticated impact are not explained further.
- **Ability to Create Blocks:**  The attacker must be able to access and use the "Create Blocks" functionality within the admin interface.
