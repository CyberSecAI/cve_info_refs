Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in WPS Hide Login plugin version 1.5.2.2, as detailed by secupress.me:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Protection Bypass #1:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin checks for `action=confirmaction` in the URL query to allow access to the login page, and uses `@require_once` to include `wp-login.php`, effectively bypassing its own hiding mechanism.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the `action` parameter in the URL.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can access the login page by adding the `action=confirmaction` parameter to the URL, bypassing the hidden login page feature.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL with the vulnerable parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special privileges or user interaction is required, an attacker just needs to craft a URL.

2.  **Protection Bypass #2:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin checks for the presence of the `adminhash` parameter in the URL to allow access to the login page.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the `adminhash` parameter in the URL.
    *  **Impact:** An attacker can access the admin login page by including the `adminhash` parameter in the URL, bypassing the intended security measure.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL with the `adminhash` parameter.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special privileges or user interaction is required, an attacker just needs to craft a URL.

3.  **Protection Bypass #3:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin redirects to the new login URL if the URL parameters `action`, `key`, and `login` are set to `rp` , when WooCommerce is active.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the `action`, `key`, and `login` URL parameters, particularly in conjunction with WooCommerce.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthenticated users can potentially access the login page by setting specific URL parameters, bypassing the intended hidden login page feature, especially if WooCommerce is enabled.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a URL with the vulnerable parameters.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special privileges or user interaction is required, an attacker just needs to craft a URL.

4.  **Protection Bypass #4:**
    *  **Root Cause:** The plugin checks the referer header for the string `wp-login.php` to allow access to the login page.
    *   **Weakness:** Insecure handling of the referer header, relying on string matching within the referer.
    *   **Impact:** By modifying the `Referer` header to include `wp-login.php` and sending a POST request to `wp-login.php?action=postpass`, the attacker can bypass the plugin's protection and access the login page.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request with a modified `Referer` header.
    *  **Required Capabilities:** Ability to send a POST request with a custom `Referer` header.

5.  **Default Parameter Usage:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The plugin uses a default value of "login" for the custom login URL.
    *   **Weakness:** Predictable default URL for the login page.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can try accessing the login page using the default "login" slug, negating the benefit of the hidden login URL, as it is already a known shortcut in WordPress.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attempting to access `/login`.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** No special privileges or user interaction are required.

6.  **Full Path Disclosure:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Calling `wpmu_activate_signup()` when the plugin's `wps_hide_login_signup_enable` hook is triggered, without including necessary files.
    *  **Weakness:** Improper handling of the `wps_hide_login_signup_enable` hook.
    *   **Impact:** Leads to a fatal error that reveals the full path to the plugin's directory, which can be valuable reconnaissance information for attackers.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Triggering the hook via crafted request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** Ability to trigger the hook via URL manipulation.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The identified vulnerabilities have been patched in version 1.5.3 of the plugin.
