### @Stefar77 **[Stefar77](/Stefar77)** commented [Apr 24, 2019](#issue-436761586) • edited Loading

Did a few fixes yesterday.

Still needs more fixes (like filtering for shell injections) and some more tweaks, working on that tonight.

I may split up the clonos object into separate objects (i.e. jail, bhyve, node) next update.

* Also still working on the formatting a bit, it's a pain to read when single commands span multiple lines without exceeding low-res text screen lengths. (~80 cols)

Sorry, something went wrong.

Next step is fix the shell injections (without breaking anything) and splitting up some stuff into own classes to make it more manageable.
