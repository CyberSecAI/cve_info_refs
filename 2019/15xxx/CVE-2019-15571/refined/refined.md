This content relates to CVE-2019-15571 as it describes a pull request that fixes SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The code used string concatenation to build SQL queries, which allowed for SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
SQL injection vulnerabilities were present due to the use of string concatenation to construct SQL queries, leaving the code vulnerable to malicious user input. The code also had potential shell injection vulnerabilities, as mentioned in the comments. There were also mentions of possible XSS vulnerabilities.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database. Shell injection could allow for remote code execution. XSS could lead to arbitrary script execution.

**Attack vectors:**
Attack vectors would include manipulating user input that was passed to the database queries without proper sanitization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would need to be able to provide malicious input to the application through forms or other data entry points that would then be used in SQL queries.
