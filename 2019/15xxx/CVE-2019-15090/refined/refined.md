Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-15090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- An out-of-bounds read exists in the `qedi_dbg_*` family of functions within the Linux kernel's QLogic QEDI iSCSI Initiator Driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The vulnerability occurs because the functions `qedi_dbg_*` uses a fixed sized `memcpy` which could attempt to read beyond the bounds of the source string if its length is less than the destination buffer's size.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to expose sensitive kernel memory contents due to the out-of-bounds read.
- **Denial of Service**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the description of the CVE-2019-15090 itself from Netapp, the NetApp advisory mentions that exploitation of vulnerabilities in linux kernels prior to 5.2.8, which includes CVE-2019-15090, could lead to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Exploitation of a faulty device**: The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by using a faulty device

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Privileges:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the iSCSI Initiator Driver.  The SUSE document specifies that the attacker needs to have low priviliges
- **Physical access:** The attacker needs to have physical access to the machine to exploit the vulnerability through a faulty device.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- **NetApp Advisory:** The NetApp advisory NTAP-20190905-0002 indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporating Linux kernels prior to 5.2.8 are susceptible to this and other vulnerabilities. The advisory provides a CVSS v3 score of 7.8 (HIGH) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- **SUSE Advisory:**  The SUSE advisory indicates that the issue is fixed and rated as having moderate severity, while the CVSS score is rated as having 6.1 points. The attack vector specified is "local".
- **openSUSE Advisory:** The openSUSE advisory indicates the fix is part of a larger patch addressing 39 vulnerabilities.
- **SUSE and openSUSE references to the bug:** Both SUSE and openSUSE indicate that this vulnerability has been resolved by referencing their respective bugzilla entries.
- **Patch:** The patch for this vulnerability removes the `memset`/`memcpy` calls within the `qedi_dbg_*` functions and instead directly utilizes the `func` parameter, which is already a null-terminated string.
- **Affected Products:** NetApp's advisory lists several affected products, including "Active IQ Unified Manager for VMware vSphere", "NetApp Data Availability Services", "NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C", "NetApp SolidFire & HCI Management Node", and "NetApp SolidFire Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)".
- **Affected Kernel Versions:** Linux kernels prior to 5.2.8 are vulnerable.
- **SUSE Kernel State:** SUSE also includes a table containing information about a variety of their products that were affected by this CVE, or were not vulnerable to it, specifying the source package, and the state of their lifecycle regarding the fix for this issue.

In summary, CVE-2019-15090 is an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the Linux kernel's QEDI iSCSI driver that could lead to information disclosure or a denial of service. The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user, and has been addressed by the different vendors.
