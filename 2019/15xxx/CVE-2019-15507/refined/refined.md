Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability arises from the way Octopus Deploy handles proxy configurations. Specifically, when a proxy requiring authentication is configured via the Octopus Server Manager, the password for that proxy may be logged in cleartext. This occurs if the environment variable `$env:HTTP_PROXY` is printed, and the password contains special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cleartext Password Logging:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of the proxy password in cleartext within deployment logs.
- **Exposure via Environment Variable:** The issue is triggered when the `$env:HTTP_PROXY` environment variable is printed to logs, revealing the password if it was configured in the proxy settings

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker who gains access to the deployment logs can obtain the cleartext proxy password.
- **Potential Lateral Movement:** With the proxy password, an attacker could potentially gain access to other systems or resources accessible through the compromised proxy.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Access to Deployment Logs:** An attacker needs to gain access to the deployment logs of an Octopus Deploy instance. This access could be achieved through various means, such as:
    - Unauthorized access to the server where logs are stored.
    - Compromise of a user account with permissions to view logs.
    - Supply chain attack

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Logs:** The attacker must have the ability to access or retrieve the deployment logs generated by the vulnerable Octopus Deploy instance.
- **Knowledge of Proxy Usage:** The attacker doesn't need to know the proxy configuration but the vulnerability is present on servers utilizing a proxy which requires authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Octopus Server versions from 2018.8.4 to 2019.7.6
- The issue is more prominent when the proxy password contains special characters, indicating that these characters may not be properly sanitized or masked in the logging process.
- The issue has been internally reported within the Octopus Deploy team.
