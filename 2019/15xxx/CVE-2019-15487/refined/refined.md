Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `URI::regexp` used for URL validation was too permissive, allowing text before the scheme (e.g., `javascript:alert(1)http://example.com`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The insufficiently validated URL could be used to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies and take over user accounts.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Modify content displayed on the page.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker could provide a malicious URL in a field expecting a teacher training URL.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to influence the input of the URL field, presumably a teacher training URL.

**Additional Details (from provided content):**
- The vulnerability was discovered during a security audit.
- The fix implemented involves adding an additional validation that the URL must start with `http://` or `https://`.
- The vulnerability was fixed in pull request #769: "Don't allow xss in teacher training urls".
- The fix was included in release v16333-GA.
