The provided content relates to CVE-2019-15683.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit message describes two issues:
1.  A potential buffer overflow in `rfbOptPamAuth()` when both TLSPlain and X509Plain security types are disabled. In this scenario, the code would test for "none" security type, whose name length is less than 5 characters, causing an out-of-bounds read when checking if a security type string ends with `plain`.
2. A stack overflow in `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage` when handling a fence message from an ill-behaved RFB client that sends more than 64 bytes of data. The server would read the oversized message and overflow the stack before detecting that the payload is too large.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Buffer Overflow:** The code in `rfbOptPamAuth()` attempts to access memory outside of the bounds of the `secTypes` structure. The code is trying to read the last 5 characters of a string by checking if it ends with "plain", but if the string is shorter than 5 characters this results in reading memory outside of the bounds.
2. **Stack Overflow:** In `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage`, the code reads the length of the fence message from the client and then reads that many bytes into a fixed-size buffer on the stack. If the length exceeds the size of the buffer (64 bytes in the case of 'data' local variable), it will lead to a stack buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
1.  The buffer overflow in `rfbOptPamAuth()` was considered innocuous because the overflow was contained within the `secTypes` structure and did not lead to exploitable behavior. However, it triggered an ASan error, which caused Xvnc to abort.
2.  The stack overflow in `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage` was also considered innocuous because the overflowed stack variables were not used after the overflow occurred. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited for code execution if the overflowed variables or the stack layout were changed.

**Attack vectors:**
1. For `rfbOptPamAuth`, this isn't really an attack vector as it would require disabling both TLSPlain and X509Plain security types which would make the server unusable.
2. For `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage`, an attacker would need to send a specially crafted RFB fence message with a payload larger than 64 bytes to the TurboVNC server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1. For the stack overflow in `rfbProcessClientNormalMessage`, an attacker would need to be able to connect to the TurboVNC server as an RFB client.
2. No special privileges are needed, as an attacker can send messages to the server during normal operation.
