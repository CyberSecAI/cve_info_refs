  "CVE-2019-15942": {
    "description": "FFmpeg through 4.2 has a \"Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value\" issue in h2645_parse because alloc_rbsp_buffer in libavcodec/h2645_parse.c mishandles rbsp_buffer.",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a mishandling of `rbsp_buffer` within the `alloc_rbsp_buffer` function in `libavcodec/h2645_parse.c`. This leads to a conditional jump or move operation that relies on an uninitialized value.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Use of uninitialized value",
           "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value"
        ],
        "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to a crash or potentially other unspecified impacts.",
         "attack_vector": "The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted video file.",
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted video file that triggers the vulnerable code path during processing with ffmpeg."
      },
      {
       "root_cause": "The issue was introduced in version 4.2 of FFmpeg due to a commit that changed how `ff_h2645_packet_split` was handled.",
       "weaknesses": [
          "Logic error leading to uninitialized value use"
        ],
        "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash or unpredictable behavior when processing the crafted input file.",
       "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted video file with affected versions of ffmpeg.",
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker must be able to supply a malicious crafted H264/H265 video input file to ffmpeg."
