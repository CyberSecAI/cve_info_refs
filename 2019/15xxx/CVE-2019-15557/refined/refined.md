The provided content is a GitHub pull request related to a fix for a SQL injection vulnerability.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to unsanitized input being used in SQL queries.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially read, modify, or delete data in the database, or even gain unauthorized access to the server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to provide malicious input to the application which is then used in an SQL query. The specific entry point for this input is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content.

The pull request includes the following commits:
- `update commons`
- `add assertTenantKeyValid`
- `fix create schema for new tenant`
The commit messages suggest that the fix includes adding validation to the tenant key and fixing how the schema is created for new tenants, which are likely related to preventing the SQL injection.
