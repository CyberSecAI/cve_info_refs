Package        : redis
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-10192 CVE-2019-10193

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the HyperLogLog implementation
of Redis, a persistent key-value database, which could result in denial
of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.

For the oldstable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3:3.2.6-3+deb9u3.

For the stable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed in
version 5:5.0.3-4+deb10u1.

Redis 3.2 release notes
=======================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:
LOW: No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH: There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
Redis 3.2.13 Released Mon Mar 18 17:24:10 CEST 2019
================================================================================
Ciritcal fixes backported from Redis 5.
================================================================================
Redis 3.2.12 Released Wed Jun 13 12:43:01 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL:
\* Multilple security issues fixed.
\* Backport of an older AOF fsync=always fix. Check 4.x release notes.
\* Backport of a \*SCAN bug. Sometimes elements could be missing from the scan.
\* Other minor things.
================================================================================
Redis 3.2.11 Released Thu Sep 21 15:47:53 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Potentially critical bugs fixed.
AOF flush on SHUTDOWN did not cared to really write the AOF buffers
(not in the kernel but in the Redis process memory) to disk before exiting.
Calling SHUTDOWN during traffic resulted into not every operation to be
persisted on disk.
Oran Agra (and also Buğra Gedik) in commit 8651e5d5:
Flush append only buffers before existing.

Redis 3.2.10 Released Fri Jul 28 17:49:07 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: This release contains a number of fixes that are not
critical in the general case, but quite important
in certain use cases. Upgrading is suggested but not
mandatory.
Dear Redis users,
while 4.0.1 is already out, this is a maintenance release of Redis 3.2.
It fixes several bugs, the most interesting ones are the following:
1. INFO server.stat\_net\_output\_bytes field was computed in a wrong way, now
the output is correct.
2. SET with EX/PX options are now propagated correctly in the AOF, using
the absolute times.
3. CLIENT PAUSE was fixed to prevent eviction of keys, so that master and
slave continue to be consistent for the time the pause is active.
4. GEORADIUS(BYMEMBER)\_RO variants for read-only operations added.
5. HyperLogLog sanity detection fixed in an edge case.
6. Redis Cluster crash due to mis-handling of hidden node flags fixed.
If you think you may be affected by the above problems, upgrading is a
good idea.
Have a nice day,
Salvatore

Redis 3.2.8 Released Sun Feb 12 16:11:18 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release reverts back the Jemalloc upgrade
that is believed to potentially cause a server
deadlock. A MIGRATE crash is also fixed.
Two important bug fixes, the first of one is critical:
1. Apparently Jemalloc 4.4.0 may contain a deadlock under particular
conditions. See https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3799.
We reverted back to the previously used Jemalloc versions and plan
to upgrade Jemalloc again after having more info about the
cause of the bug.
2. MIGRATE could crash the server after a socket error. See for reference:
https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/3796.
List of commits:
antirez in commit 7178cac:
Revert "Jemalloc updated to 4.4.0."

antirez in commit 33fad43:
Fix MIGRATE closing of cached socket on error.

================================================================================
Redis 3.2.7 Released Tue Jan 31 16:21:41 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes important security and correctness
issues. It is especially important to upgrade for Redis
Cluster users and for users running Redis in their laptop
since a cross-scripting attack is fixed in this release.
Main bugs fixes and improvements in this release:
1. MIGRATE could incorrectly move keys between Redis Cluster nodes by turning
keys with an expire set into persisting keys. This bug was introduced with
the multiple-keys migration recently. It is now fixed. Only applies to
Redis Cluster users that use the resharding features of Redis Cluster.
2. As Redis 4.0 beta and the unstable branch already did (for some months at
this point), Redis 3.2.7 also aliases the Host: and POST commands to QUIT
avoiding to process the remaining pipeline if there are pending commands.
This is a security protection against a "Cross Scripting" attack, that
usually involves trying to feed Redis with HTTP in order to execute commands.
Example: a developer is running a local copy of Redis for development
purposes. She also runs a web browser in the same computer. The web browser
could send an HTTP request to http://127.0.0.1:6379 in order to access the
Redis instance, since a specially crafted HTTP requesta may also be partially
valid Redis protocol. However if POST and Host: break the connection, this
problem should be avoided. IMPORTANT: It is important to realize that it
is not impossible that another way will be found to talk with a localhost
Redis using a Cross Protocol attack not involving sending POST or Host: so
this is only a layer of protection but not a definitive fix for this class
of issues.
3. A ziplist bug that could cause data corruption, could crash the server and
MAY ALSO HAVE SECURITY IMPLICATIONS was fixed. The bug looks complex to
exploit, but attacks always get worse, never better (cit). The bug is very
very hard to catch in practice, it required manual analysis of the ziplist
code in order to be found. However it is also possible that rarely it
happened in the wild. Upgrading is required if you use LINSERT and other
in-the-middle list manipulation commands.
4. We upgraded to Jemalloc 4.4.0 since the version we used to ship with Redis
was an early 4.0 release of Jemalloc. This version may have several
improvements including the ability to better reclaim/use the memory of
system.
The following is the list of commits:

Ziplist: insertion bug under particular conditions fixed.

Redis 3.2.6 Released Tue Dec 06 09:33:29 CET 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: GEORADIUS, BITFIELD and Redis Cluster minor fixes.
This release mainly fixes three bugs:
1. A bug with BITFIELD that may cause the bitmap corruption when setting offsets
larger than the current string size.
2. A GEORADIUS bug that may happen when using very large radius lengths, in
the range of 10000km or alike, due to wrong bounding box calculation.
3. A bug with Redis Cluster which crashes when reading a nodes configuration
file with zero bytes at the end, which sometimes happens with certain ext4
configurations after a system crash.

Redis 3.2.4 Released Mon Sep 26 08:58:21 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Redis 3.2 and unstable contained a security
vulnerability fixed by this release.
Hello Redis Wizards of the Memory Stores Empire,
this is a Redis critical release in order to fix a security issue
which is documented clearly here:
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/6d9f8e2462fc2c426d48c941edeb78e5df7d2977
Thanks to Cory Duplantis of Cisco Talos for reporting the issue.
IMPACT:
The gist is that using CONFIG SET calls (or by manipulating redis.conf)
an attacker is able to compromise certain fields of the "server" global
structure, including the aof filename pointer, that could be made pointing
to something else. In turn the AOF name is used in different contexts such
as logging, rename(2) and open(2) syscalls, leading to potential problems.
Please note that since having access to CONFIG SET also means to be able
to change the AOF filename (and many other things) directly, this issue
actual real world impact is quite small, so I would not panik: if you
have CONFIG SET level of access, you can do more and more easily.
AFFECTED VERSIONS:
All Redis 3.2.x versions are affected.
OTHER CHANGES IN THIS RELEASE:
This release also includes other things:
\* TCP binding bug fixed when only certain addresses were available for
a given port.
\* A much better crash report that includes part of the Redis binary:
this will allow to fix bugs even when we just have a crash log and
no other help from the original poster oft the issue.
\* A fix for Redis Cluster redis-trib displaying of info after creating
a new cluster.
Please check the following list of commits for credits about who did what.
Thanks to all the contributors and a special thank to Oran Agra for the
help in this release.

Redis 3.2.3 Released Tue Aug 02 10:55:24 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Fix replication delay and redis-cli security issue.
Hello,
this is a minor release of Redis addressing two bugs:
1. There was an inverted if statement logic problem in replication.c causing
a replication delay. This is not an actual problem since things work
as expected, but worth to fix ASAP anyway.
2. Redis-cli created the history file with insecure permissions, allowing
reding from the file. This was actually a bug in linenoise which is
now fixed. The applied fix is from Chris Lamb.

Redis 3.2.2 Released Thu Jul 28 14:14:54 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: A Redis server and a Sentinel crash are now fixed.
GEORADIUS errors in reported entries are fixed.
Hi all! Redis 3.2.2 is finally out with non trivial bugfixes and a few new
features. Let's start from the bugs:
1. There was a bug in the List type implementation, able to cause the
crash of the server under certain (non trivial to replicate) circumstances
when the LSET command was used. Now the bug is fixed and a new stress tester
that was able to easily trigger the bug was added to the test suite.
2. Redis Sentinel, when monitoring multiple masters, could crash after
a Sentinel address update event.
3. Redis Sentinel now checks slaves INFO state more often when disconnected.
This is not really a bug fix, but may allow to more easily detect that
a slave is able to fail over its master reducing certain delays.
4. It was possible, under a variety of conditions, that the AOF and RDB children
process could spawn at the same time. This is known to trash disk I/O,
AOF performances, and to ultimately create latency in the Redis server.
Normally Redis avoids to have the two writing children at the same time, but
there were edge cases discovered by Oran Agra (that also co-authored the
fix with me) where the double-fork could happen. In order to fix this bug
non trivial changes to the replication code were operated, however it was
important to back port this fix into 3.2.2 because the bug could lead to
bad latency experiences in certain cases.
5. Many GEORADIUS bugs are now fixed \o/. This started as a failing CI
test. I grepped for more clues and there were a number of random failures
in the points reported by GEORADIUS. The errors were found to be related
to three different bugs (one of these was a bug in the test itself).
It's not a critical bug: the effect is to, sometimes, don't report objects
that are near the radius, but only with specific sets of coordinates
and radius settings. However now the issues are fixed and the error
vectors were added as regression tests.
And now the good news (not that bug fixes are not good...), that is, the
new features!
1. Now slaves support the slave-announce-ip and slave-announce-port options.
Using these features a slave can be reported by the master `INFO` output
and `ROLE` command as having arbitrary IP and port. This allows to have
Sentinel deployments when working with containers or NAT-ed environments
more easily.
2. The RDB check utlity is now part of Redis and uses the same RDB code that
Redis uses in order to load the dataset in memory, so a given version
of Redis is always able to check the RDB it produced... without another
external check tool which is supposed to be taken in sync with the
rdb.c implementation. This in turn also means that the new RDB checking
is able to spot more complex bugs, since it really loads the dataset
instead of just skipping bytes.
About the redis-check-dump utility, now it is also able to show certain
information about the RDB file, like the version that produced it, when
it was produced, and so forth. Example:
./redis-check-rdb dump.rdb
[offset 0] Checking RDB file dump.rdb
[offset 32] AUX FIELD redis-ver = '3.2.2'
[offset 46] AUX FIELD redis-bits = '64'
[offset 58] AUX FIELD ctime = '1469710178'
[offset 73] AUX FIELD used-mem = '1186528'
The ability to check how much memory was used by the instance that produced
the RDB file can be especially useful.
For credits and the full change log, see the list of commits below, that was
modified in order to be a bit less verbose compared to the last releases.
Enjoy!

Redis 3.2.1 Released Fri Jun 17 15:01:56 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Critical fix to Redis Sentinel, due to 3.2.0 regression
compared to 3.0.
Hey, this is Redis 3.2.1, and this release should bring some grain of
maturity to Redis 3.2. The list of commits following this note will tell
you the details, but the main things addressed in this release are the
following:
1. A critical bug in Sentinel was hopefully fixed. During the big 3.2
refactoring of Redis Sentinel, in order to implement connection sharing
to make Sentinel able to scale better (few Sentinels to monitor many
masters), a bug was introduced that mis-counted the number of pending
commands in the Redis link. This in turn resulted into an inability to talk
with certain Redis instances. A common result of this bug was the inability
of Redis Sentinel to reconfigure back the old master, after a failover,
when it is reachable again, as the slave of the new master. This was due
to the inability to talk with the old master at all.
2. BITFIELD bugs fixed.
3. GEO commands fixes on syntax errors and edge cases.
4. RESTORE now accepts dumps generated by older Redis versions.
5. Jemalloc now is really configured to save you memory, for a problem a
change in the jemalloc configuration did not really survived when the
3.2.0 release was finalized.
6. TTL and TYPE command no longer alter the last access time of a key, for
LRU evictions purposes. A new TOUCH command was introduced \*just\* to
update the access time of a key.
7. A bug was fixed in redis-cli, that connected to the instance running on the
port 6379 if there was one, regardless of what was specified.
8. TCP keep alive is now enabled by default. This should fix most ghost
connections problems without resulting in any practical change in otherwise
sane deployments.
9. A Sentinel crash that could happen during failovers was fixed.
And of course, more minor things that you can read in the detailed log
below. There are still reported bugs for 3.2 that were not fixed in this
release, but nothing critical AFAIK, and I wanted to release this one ASAP,
so likely a new release will not be too far.
Enjoy,
Salvatore

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/6ad0371c9b4206a7a6692d50c9a301457baf9b6d
This bug most experienced effect was an inability of Redis to
reconfigure back old masters to slaves after they are reachable again
after a failover. This was due to failing to reset the count of the
pending commands properly, so the master appeared fovever down.
Was introduced in Redis 3.2 new Sentinel connection sharing feature
which is a lot more complex than the 3.0 code, but more scalable.
Many thanks to people reporting the issue, and especially to
@sskorgal for investigating the issue in depth.
Hopefully closes #3285.

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/58f1d446c35e8fe62df7c9ebe10f3c40a386c022
I recently introduced populating the autocomplete help array with the
COMMAND command if available. However this was performed before parsing
the arguments, defaulting to instance 6379. After the connection is
performed it remains stable.
The effect is that if there is an instance running on port 6339,
whatever port you specify is ignored and 6379 is connected to instead.
The right port will be selected only after a reconnection.
Close #3314.

| By antirez, 2016-06-16 15:53:57 +0200
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/f592b4d3178963878084a522b4fd050772c335ae
Reference issue #3218.
Checking the code I can't find a reason why the original RESTORE
code was so opinionated about restoring only the current version. The
code in to `rdb.c` appears to be capable as always to restore data from
older versions of Redis, and the only places where it is needed the
current version in order to correctly restore data, is while loading the
opcodes, not the values itself as it happens in the case of RESTORE.
For the above reasons, this commit enables RESTORE to accept older
versions of values payloads.

| Geo: fix typo in geohashEstimateStepsByRadius().
| By antirez, 2016-05-30 15:31:19 +0200

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/16102bc0af0912a0c9a92aedddf796eb24a80b9e
I'm the author of this line but I can't see a good reason for it to
don't be a typo, a step of 26 should be valid with 52 bits per
coordinate, moreover the line was:
if (step > 26) step = 25;
So a step of 26 was actually already used, except when one of 27 was
computed (which is invalid) only then it was trimmed to 25 instead of
26.
All tests passing after the change.

Probably there is no compiler that will actaully break the code or raise
a signal for unsigned -> signed overflowing conversion, still it was
apparently possible to write it in a more correct way.
All tests passing.

================================================================================
Redis 3.2.0 Released Fri May 06 08:47:10 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: 3.2-RC users should upgrade ASAP to this more
stable release of Redis.
Hello, this is Redis 3.2.0 stable! And with the new release there is a new
format for the changelog. Now it is composed of a "letter" like the one
you are reading, followed by all the commits composing the release for people
interested in the details.
There are a few changes between the latest release candidate of Redis 3.2
and the final 3.2.0 release. The main ones are the obvious bug fixes you
can find detailed below, also a few new things:
Critical bugs fixed:
\* There was a problem in the way a cluster instance loaded the AOF that
could cause data written via scripts to be lost during reshardings.
New things:
\* There is a new very powerful BITFIELD command. Check the documentation
here: http://redis.io/commands/BITFIELD
\* CONFIG GET is allowed during the loading of the dataset.
\* The DEBUG command have new features and can show an help with DEBUG HELP.
\* redis-cli show hits about the commands arguments to the right.
\* GEORADIUS got a STORE / STOREDIST option to store the result into a target
key (as as orted set) instead of reporting it to the user.
\* Redis Cluster replicas migration now works in a slightly different way. In
the past a slave could migrate only to a master that used to have slaves
in the past (and if there was still trace of this information). Now instead
if a new slave gets at least a slot, and at least one other master in the
cluster has a slave, then the new master is considered a valid target for
replica migration. So if it will be orphaned and there is a spare slave
it will get one.
\* CLUSTER SLOTS output now includes the node ID (in a backward compatible
manner).
\* A lot of bug fixes you can read in the commits details below, with the
authors that kindly provided many useful patches. Thanks.
As usually what "stable" means is that we are confident the release is mature,
however do your tests before putting it into production in your environemnt
as it's fresh meat anyway.
Cheers,
Salvatore

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/708f486c77b455fa7ae1e87cf31278474eb9d432
This fixes a bug introduced by d827dbf, and makes the code consistent
with the logic of always allowing, while the cluster is down, commands
that don't target any key.
As a side effect the code is also simpler now.

I've renamed maxmemoryToString to evictPolicyToString since that is
more accurate (and easier to mentally connect with the correct data), as
well as updated the function to user server.maxmemory\_policy rather than
server.maxmemory. Now with a default config it is actually returning
the correct policy rather than volatile-lru.

| Cluster regression test for #3043.
| By antirez, 2016-05-02 18:36:09 +0200
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/38cf2bd257d09b360be6adf450d59592a359696d
The test works but is very slow so far, since it involves resharding
1/5 of all the cluster slots from master 0 to the other 4 masters and
back into the original master.

| New masters with slots are now targets of migration if others are.
| By antirez, 2016-05-02 16:41:56 +0200
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/7b618823c189c24313effbccda7022d167ea419c
This fixes issue #3043.
Before this fix, after a complete resharding of a master slots
to other nodes, the master remains empty and the slaves migrate away
to other masters with non-zero nodes. However the old master now empty,
is no longer considered a target for migration, because the system has
no way to tell it had slaves in the past.
This fix leaves the algorithm used in the past untouched, but adds a
new rule. When a new or old master which is empty and without slaves,
are assigend with their first slot, if other masters in the cluster have
slaves, they are automatically considered to be targets for replicas
migration.

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/0b69c9865619b54b75576e67aaafe7b018734bec
This fix was suggested by Anthony LaTorre, that provided also a good
test case that was used to verify the fix.
The problem with the old implementation is that, the time returned by
a timer event (that is the time after it want to run again) is added
to the event \*start time\*. So if the event takes, in order to run, more
than the time it says it want to be scheduled again for running, an
infinite loop is triggered.

| BITFIELD command initial implementation.
| By antirez, 2016-02-25 23:31:45 +0100
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/761a77287107ce53dbf4755f1435cc9660b6c86d
The new bitfield command is an extension to the Redis bit operations,
where not just single bit operations are performed, but the array of
bits composing a string, can be addressed at random, not aligned
offsets, with any width unsigned and signed integers like u8, s5, u10
(up to 64 bit signed integers and 63 bit unsigned integers).
The BITFIELD command supports subcommands that can SET, GET, or INCRBY
those arbitrary bit counters, with multiple overflow semantics.
Trivial and credits:
A similar command was imagined a few times in the past, but for
some reason looked a bit far fetched or not well specified.
Finally the command was proposed again in a clear form by
Yoav Steinberg from Redis Labs, that proposed a set of commands on
arbitrary sized integers stored at bit offsets.
Starting from this proposal I wrote an initial specification of a single
command with sub-commands similar to what Yoav envisioned, using short
names for types definitions, and adding control on the overflow.
This commit is the resulting implementation.
Examples:
BITFIELD mykey OVERFLOW wrap INCRBY i2 10 -1 GET i2 10

https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/0f3fb0097ae70e36ee65468b79f0be4160934bb4
CLUSTER SLOTS now includes IDs in the nodes description associated with
a given slot range. Certain client libraries implementations need a way
to reference a node in an unique way, so they were relying on CLUSTER
NODES, that is not a stable API and may change frequently depending on
Redis Cluster future requirements.

--[ Redis 3.2.0 RC3 (version 3.1.103) ] Release date: 28 jan 2016
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: this release fixes a non trivial Sentinel crash.
\* [FIX] avg\_ttl reporting in INFO improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Sentinel: improve handling of known Sentinel instances.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo, thanks to Paweł Kowalczykf or the original
crash report).
\* [FIX] Redis Cluster address update (via gossip section) processing improved
to avoid initiating inwanted handshakes.
--[ Redis 3.2.0 RC2 (version 3.1.102) ] Release date: 25 jan 2016
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: this release fixes important Redis Cluster bugs.
\* [FIX] Many fixes to MIGRATE multiple keys implementation. The command
could handle errors in a faulty way leading to crashes or other
unexpected behaviors. MIGRATE command refactoring.
(The analysis of the faulty conditions was conducted by
Kevin McGehee. The fix was developed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] A Redis Cluster node crash was fixed because of wrong handling of
node->slaveof pointers.
(Reported by JackyWoo, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Fix redis-trib rebalance when nodes need to be left empty because
the specified weight is zero.
(Reported by Shahar Mor, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] MIGRATE: Never send -ASK redirections for MIGRATE when there are
open slots. Redis-trib and other cluster management utility must
always be free to move keys between nodes about open slots, in order
to reshard, fix the cluster configuration, and so forth.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Lua debugger crash when printing too deeply nested objects.
(Reported by Paul Kulchenko, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Redis-cli implementation of Lua debugging now allows to use the
SCRIPT DEBUG command directly, switching to debugging mode as needed.
(Reported by Paul Kulchenko, fixed by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [FIX] Redis-trib is now able to fix more errors. A new CLUSTER subcommand
called BUMPEPOCH was introduced in order to support new modes
for the "fix" subcommand. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Redis proctected mode: this feature improves Redis security and makes
harder to run Redis in a configuration that is unsecure because no
firewalling was used in order to protect Redis from external accesses.
See this Reddit post for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/3zv85m/new\_security\_feature\_redis\_protected\_mode/ (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Cluster/Sentinel tests now use OSX leak to perform leak detection
at the end of every unit. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Detect and show server crashes during Cluster/Sentinel tests.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] More reliable Cluster/Sentinel test becuase of timing errors and
-LOADING errors. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
--[ Redis 3.2.0 RC1 (version 3.1.101) ] Release date: 23 dec 2015
This is the first release candidate of Redis 3.2. The changelog above shows
what's new in this release. In the next of the following weeks we'll test
in depth every feature and we'll release new RCs as bugs are discovered
and fixed. Note that while 3.2 looks solid already, it contains many changes
to its internals. It's still fresh code compared to 3.0.
General changes:
\* [NEW] Lua scripts "effect replication". Makes possible to write scripts
with side effects, use of random commands, and so forth.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Lua scripts selective replication. Makes possible to replicate to
slaves and AOF only selected parts of a script. (Design by
Yossi Gottlieb and Salvatore Sanfilippo, implemented by Salvatore)
\* [NEW] Geo indexing support via GEOADD, GEORADIUS and other commands.
See http://redis.io/commands/geoadd for more information.
(Initially implemented in a fork of Redis called "Ardb".
Matt Stancliff "imported back" the work to Redis and created the
initial API and implementation. Salvatore Sanfilippo modified
the API and the implementation, fixed bugs, improved performances
and unified the duplicated code with t\_zset.c)
\* [NEW] Lua debugger. A complete stepping, remote debugger for Lua scripts.
Video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMvRfStaoyM
(Salvatore Sanfilippo with many feedbacks and testing from
Itamar Haber)
\* [NEW] SDS improvements for speed and maximum string length.
This makes Redis more memory efficient in different use cases.
(Design and implementation by Oran Agra, some additional work
by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Modify Jemalloc size classes to make certain Redis objects fit
better, improving memory efficiency. (Oran Agra)
\* [NEW] Better consistency behavior between masters and slaves for expired
keys. The slaves are only able to logically consider a key expired
even before receiving the `DEL` command from the master. This avoids
the delay there is sometimes between the natural expire of the key
and the moment the slave is notified. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Support daemon supervision by upstart or systemd (Pierre-Yves Ritschard)
\* [NEW] New encoding for the List type: Quicklists. Very important memory
savings and storage space in RDB gains (up to 10x sometimes).
(Design and implementation by Matt Stancliff. RDB storage reworked
by Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] SPOP with optional count argument. (Initial implementation by
Alon Diamant, mostly reimplemented by Salvatore Sanfilippo for speed
and in order to make the replication of a this class of commands,
having as logical effect the execution of multiple commands, possible).
\* [NEW] Support for RDB AUX fields. Now RDB files contain additional info
like the creation date, version of Redis generating it and so forth.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Faster RDB loading via the RESIZEDB opcode to avoid useless hash tables
rehashings. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] HSTRLEN command. (@landmime and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CONFIG SET/GET implementations refactored, partially rewritten,
now exposing more config options. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLUSTER NODES major speedup. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLIENT KILL TYPE MASTER, to kill (disconnect) masters from slaves.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Jemalloc updated to 4.0.3 (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] DEBUG RESTART/CRASH-AND-RECOVER [delay] (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] CLIENT REPLY command implemented: ON, OFF and SKIP modes.
(Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Crash report produced by Redis on crash improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] Better memory test on crash. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
Redis Cluster changes:
All the Redis Cluster changes in 3.2 were backported to 3.0, so there is
technically nothing new for now in this release. The most important things
are:
\* Cluster rebalancing.
\* A pipelined MIGRATE command which is 10x faster and makes resharding
and rebalancing faster.
\* Improved replicas migration.
\* As a side effect of quicklists encoding (see above items), moving big
lists between nodes is now a lot faster.
Redis Sentinel changes:
\* [NEW] Sentinel connection sharing. Makes Sentinels able to scale to
monitor many masters. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* [NEW] New SENTINEL INFO-CACHE command. (Matt Stancliff)
\* More things backported to Redis 3.0 in the past, so no longer news of 3.2.
Migrating from 3.0 to 3.2
=========================
Redis 3.0 is mostly a strict subset of 3.2, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.0 to 3.2. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 3.2 release:
\* The default configuration file now binds to 127.0.0.1.
\* Slaves try to no longer expose stale data about already expired keys.
\* The RDB format changed. Redis 3.2 is still able to read 3.0 (and all the
past versions) files, but not the other way around.
\* Behavior on crash may be different. The crash log format changed and
the memory test executed is now different.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credits: For each release, a list of changes with the relative author is

Security Advisory: Important

## Red Hat Insights patch analysis

Identify and remediate systems affected by this advisory.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A1819)

## Topic

An update for rh-redis5-redis is now available for Red Hat Software Collections.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Security Fix(es):

* redis: Heap buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10192)
* redis: Stack buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10193)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A2002)

## Topic

An update for the redis:5 module is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Important. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data-structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, and sorted sets. For performance, Redis works with an in-memory data set. You can persist it either by dumping the data set to disk every once in a while, or by appending each command to a log.

Security Fix(es):

* redis: Heap buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10192)
* redis: Stack buffer overflow in HyperLogLog triggered by malicious client (CVE-2019-10193)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

for more information. Note that there are important fixes to the AOF
implementation so Redis 4.0.12 should be considered as a worthwhile
upgrade in production environments where AOF is used and there is the
idea of sticking with Redis 4 for some time.

Redis 4.0.11 Released Fri Aug 03 17:09:24 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: not critical but very important bugs fixed.
Dear users, this is just a bugfix release of Redis 4. All new work
is now focused on Redis 5, however we backported a number of bug fixes here:
\* The disconnection time between the master and slave was reset in an
incorrect place, sometimes a good slave will not be able to failover
because it claims it was disconnected for too much time from the master.
\* A replication bug, rare to trigger but non impossible, is in Redis for
years. It was lately discovered at Redis Labs and fixed by Oran Agra.
It may cause disconnections, desynchronizations and other issues.
\* RANDOMKEY may go in infinite loop on rare situations. Now fixed.
\* EXISTS now works in a more consistent way on slaves.
\* Sentinel: backport of an option to deny a potential security problem
when the SENTINEL command is used to configure an arbitrary script
to execute.
Many of these issues are there for a very long time, however upgrading
is a good idea.

Redis 4.0.10 Released Wed Jun 13 12:49:13 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes important security issues.
HIGH: This release fixes a SCAN commands family bug.
MODERATE: This release fixes a PSYNC2 edge case with expires.
MODERATE: Sentinel related fixes.
LOW: All the other issues
Redis 4.0.10 fixes a number of important issues:
\* Important security issues related to the Lua scripting engine.
Please check https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5017
for more information.
\* A bug with SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN, that may not return all the elements.
We also add a regression test that can trigger the issue often when present, and
may in theory be able to find unrelated regressions.
\* A PSYNC2 bug is fixed: Redis should not expire keys when saving RDB files
because otherwise it is no longer possible to use such RDB file as a base
for partial resynchronization. It no longer represents the right state.
\* Compatibility of AOF with RDB preamble when the RDB checksum is disabled.
\* Sentinel bug that in some cases prevented Sentinel to detect that the master
was down immediately. A delay was added to the detection.
\* Other minor issues.
The following is the list of commits composing the release, please check

Redis 4.0.9 Released Mon Mar 26 17:52:32 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Critical upgrade for users using AOF with the
fsync policy set to "always".
Dear Redis users,
Redis version 4.0.9 adds a few interesting new features and fixes a very
critical bug regarding the Append Only File. Let's start with the bad news
(the critical bug), explaining what happens and in what conditions:
Critical AOF bug explained
--------------------------
When AOF is enabled with the fsync policy set to "always", we have a
(rarely used) setup where Redis fsyncs every new write on disk. On this
setup Redis MUST reply to the client with an OK code to the write, only
after the write is already persisted on disk.
Because of a bug, in particular conditions, it sometimes happens (verified
experimentally that the condition can be actually created) that in the
same event loop cycle the command is both processed and the reply sent, before
the beforeSleep() function has the ability to fsync the write on disk.
The redis 4.0.9 release fixes this problem introducing the concept of
write barriers in the Redis event loop (ae.c). If you are using a different
AOF setup, like fsync everysec, you are not affected because such guarantee
is not provided anyway. Similarly if you have fsync set to always but you
do not semantically use the fact that the reply is only sent after the
successful fsync, you may avoid upgrading.
Other bugfixes
--------------
Other things that we fixed in this release include:
\* Latency monitor could report wrong latencies under certain conditions.
\* AOF rewriting could fail when a backgronud rewrite is triggered and
at the same time the AOF is switched on/off.
\* Redis Cluster crash-recovery safety improved.
\* Other smaller fixes (check commnits).
New features
------------
\* Redis Cluster has now the ability to configure certain slaves so that
they'll never attempt a failover.
\* Keyspace notifications API in modules.
\* RM\_Call() is now faster by reusing the same client.
\* Tracking of the percentage of keys already logically expired but yet
not evicted.
\* Other smaller improvements (check commits)

Redis 4.0.8 Released Fri Feb 2 11:17:40 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL ONLY for Redis Cluster users. Otherwise no reason
to upgrade at all.
Redis 4.0.8 fixes a single critical bug in the radix tree data structure
used for Redis Cluster keys slot tracking. The problem was actually fixed
10 months ago into unstable, but it was fixed in a commit related to Streams
so it was never backported (for error) into the 4.0 branch.
The problem will crash Redis Cluster instances during deletions, but it is
very hard to trigger: only when the node removed is in the edge of a memory
mapped area there are the conditions to create an issue, because otherwise
the code just accesses an out of range word in read-only way in an allocated
structure: this is almost always harmless.
The single commit in this release:
f603940f Rax updated to latest antirez/rax commit. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.7 Released Wed Jan 24 11:01:40 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: Several bugs fixed, but none of critical level.
Dear Redis Users,
Redis 4.0.7 addresses a number of problems and adds a few things that are
very useful to have and was worth to backport into a patchlevel release.
Here is a list of the most important things, but you can find the full list
of commits below as usually:
\* Many 32 bit overflows were addressed in order to allow to use Redis with
a very significant amount of data, memory size permitting. (zhaozhao.zz,
Oran Agra)
\* MEMORY USAGE fixed for the list type. (gnuhpc)
\* Allow read-only scripts in Redis Cluster. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix AOF pipes setup in edge case. (heqin)
\* AUTH option for MIGRATE. (AlexStocks, Salvatore Sanfilippo, Fabio Nicotra)
\* HyperLogLogs are no longer converted from sparse to dense in order
to be merged. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix AOF rewrite dead loop under edge cases. (heqin)
\* Fix processing of large bulk strings (>= 2GB). (Oran Agra)
\* Added RM\_UnlinkKey in modules API. (Dvir Volk)
\* Fix Redis Cluster crashes when certain commands with a variable number
of arguments are called in an improper way. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix memory leak in lazyfree engine. (zhaozhao.zz)
\* Fix many potentially successful partial synchronizations that end
doing a full SYNC, because of a bug destroying the replication
backlog on the slave. So after a failover the slave was often not able
to PSYNC with masters, and a full SYNC was triggered. The bug only
happened after 1 hour of uptime so escaped the unit tests. (Oran Agra)
\* Improve anti-affinity in master/slave allocation for Redis Cluster
when the cluster is created. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Improve output buffer handling for slaves, by not limiting the amount
of writes a slave could receive. (Guy Benoish)
The full list of commits follow.
Enjoy,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.6 Released Thu Dec 4 17:54:10 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: More errors in the fixes for PSYNC2 in Redis 4.0.5
were identified.
This release fixes yet more errors present in the 4.0.5 fixes, that could
affect slaves. Moreover another critical issue in quicklists, when they are
used at a massive memory scale, was fixed in this release. Upgrading from
any 4.0.x release, especially if you are running 4.0.4 or 4.0.5, is highly
recommended.
Note that while this fix for 4.0.6 was written in an hurry as well, this
time we took extra precautions in order to avoid writing a broken patch:
1. The code was reviewed by two developers independently.
2. A regression test about the problem introduced in 4.0.4/5 was added.
3. Resisting to duplicated Lua scripts loading into the Lua engine is now
the default action of the loading function, thus it's simpler to stress
its behavior.
4. The code section was tested with Valgrind.
The following is the list of commits included in this release:

Redis 4.0.5 Released Thu Dec 1 16:03:32 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Redis 4.0.4 fix for PSYNC2 was broken, causing the
slave to crash when receiving an RDB file from the
master that contained a duplicated Lua script.
Please upgrade ASAP if you are with 4.0.4 and you use any form of Lua scripting
because this problem will easily crash Redis.
================================================================================
Redis 4.0.4 Released Thu Nov 30 18:42:12 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Several PSYNC2 bugs can corrupt the slave data set
after a restart and a successful PSYNC2 handshake.
This is a quick followup to Redis 4.0.3 since I forgot to add a few fixes...
that are actually described in the 4.0.3 changelog (but not in the list of
commits). Basically it's the following commits, implementing the ability
to persist scripts into RDB files for a successful PSYNC, otherwise a corruption
could happen when a slave is restarted and receives EVALSHA from the master
about scripts it does not know:
8449227f PSYNC2: Fix off by one buffer size in luaCreateFunction().
eeac1d35 PSYNC2: just store script bodies into RDB.
fb0441a8 PSYNC2: luaCreateFunction() should handle NULL client parameter.
0429db3c PSYNC2: Save Lua scripts state into RDB file.
d06fbbdd Regression test: Slave restart with EVALSHA in backlog issue #4483.
ab3d3aca Prevent corruption of server.executable after DEBUG RESTART.
b7c7edf9 Be more verbose when DEBUG RESTART fails.
Please upgrade ASAP to 4.0.4 becuase 4.0.3 had an incomplete set of fixes.
Cheers and sorry for the 4.0.3 fiasco ;-)

Redis 4.0.3 Released Thu Nov 30 13:14:50 CET 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Several PSYNC2 bugs can corrupt the slave data set
after a restart and a successful PSYNC2 handshake.
Hi all, Redis 4.0.3 contains several bug fixes to different parts of Redis 4.0,
but the highlight is definitely in the "PSYNC after restart" that the new
RDB format, containing replication metadata information, was able to provide
to Redis 4.0. There were several bugs that are addressed in this release.
Moreover several LFU fixes improve the ability of Redis to correctly estimate
the popularity of keys. This release also fixes important bugs in Redis modules,
including bugs related to replication of modules commands, reloading the same
module multiple times, and other related things. Finally there is even a
security fix related to loading a corrupted Cluster state from a corrupted
file. We advice to upgrade ASAP. Check the list of commits for credits, several
people helped a lot in this release. I'm grateful to each of them.
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.2 Released Thu Sep 21 15:47:53 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Several potentially critical bugs fixed.
Hello, this release addresses several significant bugs in Redis 4.0:
1. A number of bugs were fixed in the area of PSYNC2 replication in the
specific area of restarting an instance with an RDB file having the
repliacation meta-data to continue without a full resynchronization. The
old code allowed several inconsistencies under certain conditions, like
starting a master with an RDB file generated by a slave, and later using
such master to connect previous slaves having the same replication history.
Because of other bugs, sometimes the replication resulted in a full
synchronization even if actually a partial resynchronization was possible
and so forth. Several commits by different authors fix different bugs here.
2. AOF flush on SHUTDOWN did not cared to really write the AOF buffers
(not in the kernel but in the Redis process memory) to disk before exiting.
Calling SHUTDOWN during traffic resulted into not every operation to be
persisted on disk.
3. The SLOWLOG could reference values inside string objects stored at keys,
creating a race condition during FLUSHALL ASYNC while the DB is reclaimed
in another thread.
There are other smaller bugs addessed in this relase, see the full commit
history below for more information.
A big thank you to all the contributors of this release. Without the
help I received, Redis 4.0 would take a much longer time to mature. It's
a real pleasure to work together with people around the world, while making
Redis better.

Redis 4.0.1 Released Mon Jul 24 15:51:31 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency MODERATE: A few serious but non critical bugs in the modules
subsystem. A rare Redis Cluster crash fixed.
Many other minor fixes.
Hi everybody. This is the first patch level release of Redis 4.0, fixing the
obvious last minute issues discovered just after the 4.0.0 GA release, plus
a few other things that were no-brainers. The highlights here in terms
of bug fixing are:
1. Loading two or more modules exporting native data types resulted into the
inability to reload the RDB file.
2. Crash in modules when calling from Lua scripts module commands that would
block.
3. A Redis Cluster crash due to mis-handling of the "migrate-to" internal
flag.
4. Other smaller fixes not worth of a release per se, but nice to add here.
If you upgraded to 4.0 to use modules, definitely a required upgrade.
If you are using Redis Cluster, also a good idea to upgrade.
Otherwise... You can definitely wait for the next one :-)
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 4.0.0 Released Fri Jul 14 13:04:44 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: 4.0.0 GA fixes many important bugs.
Dear Redis users,
this is the first stable version of Redis 4.0. There are a number
of bug fixes and improvements compared to the previous RC, mainly:
\* Different replication fixes to PSYNC2, the new 4.0 replication engine.
\* Modules thread safe contexts were introduced. They are an experimental API right now, but the API is considered to be stable and usable when needed.
\* SLOWLOG now logs the offending client name and address. Note that this is a backward compatibility breakage in case old code assumes that the slowlog entry is composed of exactly three entries.
\* The modules native data types RDB format changed.
\* The AOF check utility is now able to deal with RDB preambles.
\* GEORADIUS\_RO and GEORADIUSBYMEMBER\_RO variants, not supporting the STORE option, were added in order to allow read-only scaling of such queries.
\* HSET is now variadic, and HMSET is considered deprecated (but will be supported for years to come). Please use HSET in new code.
\* GEORADIUS huge radius (>= ~6000 km) corner cases fixed, certain elements near the edges were not returned.
\* DEBUG DIGEST modules API added.
\* HyperLogLog commands no longer crash on certain input (non HLL) strings.
\* Fixed SLAVEOF inside MULTI/EXEC blocks.
\* Many other minor bug fixes and improvements.
Note that 4.0 is probably one of the most extreme releases of Redis ever
made in terms of changes inside the internals: all the aggregated data types
no longer use Redis Objects structures but directly SDS objects, certain
deletion operations are now threaded, the replication engine was modified
in many ways. So please handle this release with care. A few patch-level
releases will follow in the next weeks and months fixing the important issues
discovered by the users.
You can read the new set of features below in this file, there are a lot
of improvements that can make a real difference in real world use cases.
Also note that Redis 4.0 is, as usually, almost a perfect superset of Redis
3.2, so it is very rare that compatibility with the past is broken in terms
of exported commands.
IMPORTANT: Redis Cluster users, please note that, as specified in the list
of incompatibilities, Redis 4.0 cluster bus protocol is not compatible with
Redis 3.2, so in order to upgrade, a mass reboot of the instances is needed
and rolling upgrades are not possible. This change was needed in order to
add compatibility for Containers/NAT, where the bus port at a fixed offset
was not an acceptable design, so we had to change many things, resulting
in the incompatible protocol.
Have fun with Redis 4.0!

================================================================================
Redis 4.0-RC3 Released Sat Apr 22 11:19:56 CEST 2017
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Many bugs fixed and many improvements operated, so who
is using 4.0 RC2 should upgrade if possible, or at least
should carefully read this release notes to understand if
it may be affected by some bug.
Redis 3.9.103 (4.0 RC3 for the friends) is finally out, and the list of commits
is pretty long, so here is a synopsis of all the major changes operated in this
release.
Major things:
\* Finally the infamous leakage of keys with an expire, in slaves that are
configured as writable, is fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* A serious MIGRATE issue forgetting to store the TTL of the key under
certain conditions is fixed. (reported by Jinbei Wang, fixed by Jan-Erik
Rediger).
\* An in-depth investigation of the ziplist implementation was performed.
The final result was:
1. An in depth auditing (Salvatore Sanfilippo and Oran Agra).
2. The discovery of a bug and its fix (Salvatore Sanfilippo).
3. The creation of a new specification to replace ziplists with something
better, listpacks: https://gist.github.com/antirez/66ffab20190ece8a7485bd9accfbc175 (Yuval Inbar, Salvatore Sanfilippo, Oran Agra).
4. Refactoring and function to dump a ziplist for debugging purposes
(Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* New major feature: Memory de-fragmentation. This feature, contributed by
Oran Agra, allows Redis to perform "online defragmentation" of memory
if the Jemalloc allocator is used. There is some documentation in the
example `redis.conf` file. (Oran Agra)
\* Support for ARM. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix a very important "family of bugs" about PSYNC2, thanks to the help
of Kevin McGehee, Siran Yang and Oran Agra.
\* Hash function moved to SipHash 1-2 variant. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Redis Cluster failure detection improved in different ways, the most
important result is to exchange a lot less messages among nodes. (Salvatore
Sanfilippo)
All the rest:
\* A bug in the modules API ziplist iterator was fixed. (Dvir Volk).
\* The HyperLogLog implementation final cardinality approximation function
was improved to use the LogLog-Beta algorithm. (Harish Murthy and
Salvatore Sanfilippo).
\* Edge case copy-on-write disaster fix (Oran Agra).
\* Now the Redis ASCII art logo is shown only if logging to stdout and if the
stdout is a tty. (Salvatore Sanfilippo because of users request).
\* A new GEO bug fixed (and there is another pending when huge radiuses are
used, where elements at the edge may be miss-reported). (Salvatore
Sanfilippo). \*\*\*IMPORTANT\*\*\* See the list of incompatibilities below
since the GEO API has some potentially backward incompatible change.
\* ZADD crash on syntax error fixed. (Itamar Haber)
\* Fixed a division by zero but in MEMORY DOCTOR. (Jan-Erik Rediger)
\* More MIGRATE bugs fixed. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Different file descriptors potential lakes fixed. (multiple authors)
\* Support for Solaris improved. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Improve memory reclaiming in freeMemoryIfNeeded(). (Oran Agra and
Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fixes multiple bugs in the test suite. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix asynchronous commands in modules API. (Dvir Volk and Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* A new data structure, the radix tree (rax.c) was introduced into Redis in
order to fix a major Redis Cluster slowdown. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Fix `lua-time-limit` config ignored in `redis.conf`. (Salvatore Sanfilippo)
\* Jemalloc downgraded to an apparently safe version, given that recent
releases apparently hang under certain conditions. See Redis issue #3799.
For details and full credits, see the list of commits here. However note that
many information is inside the full commit message, while here only the first
line is shown.

Redis 4.0.0-RC2 Released Tue Dec 06 09:25:35 CET 2016
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW: This release mainly fixes a rare GEO API bug and a crash
related to the modules subsystem.
Redis 4.0.0-RC2 (version number 3.9.102) just fixes two bugs:
1. GEORADIUS could fail reporting items with very big radius lengths because
of a bug in the bounding box computation function. This was fixed and tests
with large radius sizes were added.
2. There was a crash in the modules subsystem that was not merged into RC1 for
an error, while it was already fixed into the "unstable" branch.
The list of commits follows:

Redis 4.0.0-RC1 Released Fri Dec 2 10:40:01 CEST 2016
================================================================================
Redis 4.0.0-RC1 (version number 3.9.101) is the first release candidate of
Redis 4.0. It is not a production quality release but all the major features
received some testing at this point, the release in feature freeze excluding
things that are considered in the middle ground between fixes and improvements.
Redis 4.0 is not called 3.4 because it is a major release that adds a number
of important and non trivial features. Many core functionalities of Redis were
seriously reworked. In the next release candidates, with your help, we'll gain
informations about the stability level of this release and will produce a new
RC every 2-4 weeks. When the entity and frequency of bug reports will slow down
under a certain level, Redis 4.0 final will be released.
As usually, certain changes to Cluster and Sentinel may not follow the Redis
release cycle and could be incorporated into Redis 4.0 at RC stage or even
after the final version, every time the changes are considered to benefit
the user base enough to be worth incorporating them ASAP without waiting
for Redis 4.2.
So, what's new in Redis 4.0?
Major features
---
\* Redis modules system. Redis now allows developers to write modules that can extend the Redis functionalities and implement new data types. The module API implements a complete abstraction layer that separates the Redis core from the module implementation, allowing the same module to be loaded by different versions of Redis without modifications. See the modules documentation here for more info: https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/INTRO.md
\* Partial Replication (PSYNC) version 2. The replication protocol was enhanced (in a backward compatible way, so that 4.0 can still act as a slave of older instances) in order to be able to partially resynchronize slaves and masters in conditions where it was impossible in the past: after a master switch because of a failover and when a slave instance is restared. Even masters turned into slaves will usually be able to partially resynchronize with the new master, if the new master was a former slave of the old master instance. The way the replication work for chained slaves (sub-slaves) is now very different, and each slave receives the same replication stream generated by the top-level master.
\* Cache eviction improvements. Redis 4.0 implements LFU (Least Frequently Used) as a new eviction algorithm, and improves the functionality, performances and precision of the existing algorithms. This blog post contains info about the changes: http://antirez.com/news/109
\* Lazy freeing of keys. Redis is now able to delete keys in the background in a different thread without blocking the server. The new `UNLINK` command is the same as `DEL` but working in a non blocking way. Similarly an `ASYNC` option was added to `FLUSHALL` and `FLUSHDB` in order to let the entire dataset or a single database to be freed asynchronously.
\* Mixed RDB-AOF format. If enabled the new format is used when rewriting the AOF file: the rewrite uses the more compact and faster to generate RDB format, and an AOF stream is appended to the file. This allows faster rewrites and reloads when using the AOF persistence.
\* A new MEMORY command, able to perform memory analysis of different kinds: troubleshooting of memory issues (with MEMORY DOCTOR, similar to LATENCY DOCTOR), reporting of the amount of memory used by a single key, more in-depth reporting of Redis memory usage compared to what the INFO command offers.
\* Redis Cluster support for NAT / Docker. There are new functionalities in order to force cluster instances to announce specific sets of IP address, client and bus ports, to the rest of the cluster, regardless of the auto detected IP. This required a bus protocol change that will force users to mass-restart all the nodes of a Redis 3.2 installation in order to upgrade to 4.0.
\* Redis uses now less memory in order to store the same amount of data. The gain depends a lot on the kind of dataset stored.
\* Redis is now able to defragment the used memory and reclaim space incrementally
while running. See the example `redis.conf` for more information.
Smaller features
---
\* Improvements to the RDB format to support 64 bit lengths, binary sorted set scores, and more. The RDB file check utility now uses the same code base of the one used by Redis itself in order to load the RDB file in memory.
\* SWAPDB command: ability to completely and immediately (no latency) replace two Redis databases.
\* Improvements to `dict.c`, the Redis hash table implementation.
\* Security improvements mapping POST and Host: commands to QUIT in order to prevent cross protocol scripting attacks.
\* RPUSHX and LPUSHX now accept a variable number of elements.
\* Reporting of additional memory used by copy on write in the INFO output.
\* Serious refactoring of many core parts of Redis.

Migrating from 3.2 to 4.0
=========================
Redis 3.2 is mostly a strict subset of 4.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 3.2 to 4.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 4.0 release:
\* The Redis Cluster bus protocol of 4.0 is no longer compatible with Redis 3.2.
This was needed in order to provide Docker / NAT compatibility to Redis
Cluster. SO in order to upgrade a Redis Cluster to 4.0, a mass restart of
all the instances is needed.
\* Redis Cluster CLUSTER NODES output is now slightly different. Nodes
addresses are now in the form host:port@bus-port instead of host:port.
Clients should use CLUSTER SLOTS in order to fetch the cluster configuration
however if they are still using CLUSTER NODES, they should be modified in
order to ignore the @bus-port part.
\* Writable slaves do not propagate writes to their sub-slaves, so writes to
writable slaves remain just local.
\* The RDB format changed. Redis 4.0 is still able to read 3.2 (and all the
past versions) files, but not the other way around.
\* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 4.0.
\* Certain INFO fields, especially related to replication, are now different.
\* GEODIST, GEOPOS and GEOHASH return values changed for non existing keys:
Previously the return value was inconsistent between non existing key
and non existing elements. Now the return is always like if the key
contains no elements if the key does not exist. So, for instance,
"GEOHASH non\_existing\_key A B C" now returns an array of 3 NULL values
as it should. In general this change should not break compatibility with
the past since in the past two different forms were provided by the server
and the new behavior is one of the two.
\* The SLOWLOG command entires contain additional two fields: the client address
and name. This is documented in the SLOWLOG command online documentation.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Redis 5.0 release notes
=======================
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade urgency levels:
LOW: No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH: There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.
SECURITY: There are security fixes in the release.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.14 Released Mon Oct 4 12:00:00 IDT 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues.
Security Fixes:
\* (CVE-2021-41099) Integer to heap buffer overflow handling certain string
commands and network payloads, when proto-max-bulk-len is manually configured
to a non-default, very large value [reported by yiyuaner].
\* (CVE-2021-32762) Integer to heap buffer overflow issue in redis-cli and
redis-sentinel parsing large multi-bulk replies on some older and less common
platforms [reported by Microsoft Vulnerability Research].
\* (CVE-2021-32687) Integer to heap buffer overflow with intsets, when
set-max-intset-entries is manually configured to a non-default, very large
value [reported by Pawel Wieczorkiewicz, AWS].
\* (CVE-2021-32675) Denial Of Service when processing RESP request payloads with
a large number of elements on many connections.
\* (CVE-2021-32672) Random heap reading issue with Lua Debugger [reported by
Meir Shpilraien].
\* (CVE-2021-32628) Integer to heap buffer overflow handling ziplist-encoded
data types, when configuring a large, non-default value for
hash-max-ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries
or zset-max-ziplist-value [reported by sundb].
\* (CVE-2021-32627) Integer to heap buffer overflow issue with streams, when
configuring a non-default, large value for proto-max-bulk-len and
client-query-buffer-limit [reported by sundb].
\* (CVE-2021-32626) Specially crafted Lua scripts may result with Heap buffer
overflow [reported by Meir Shpilraien].
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.13 Released Wed Jul 21 16:32:19 IDT 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY, contains fixes to security issues that affect
authenticated client connections on 32-bit versions. MODERATE otherwise.
Fix integer overflow in BITFIELD on 32-bit versions (CVE-2021-32761).
An integer overflow bug in Redis version 2.2 or newer can be exploited using the
BITFIELD command to corrupt the heap and potentially result with remote code
execution.
Bug fixes:
\* Fix overflows on 32-bit versions in GETBIT, SETBIT, BITCOUNT, BITPOS, and BITFIELD (#9191)
\* Fix ziplist length updates on big-endian platforms (#2080)
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.12 Released Mon Mar 1 17:29:52 IST 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: LOW, fixes a compilation issue.
Bug fixes:
\* Fix compilation error on non-glibc systems if jemalloc is not used (#8533)
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.11 Released Mon Feb 22 16:48:25 IST 2021
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY if you use 32bit build of redis (see bellow), LOW
otherwise.
Integer overflow on 32-bit systems (CVE-2021-21309):
Redis 4.0 or newer uses a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk
input size. By default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms.
If the limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a client
may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would result with buffer
overflow and heap corruption.
Bug fixes:
\* Avoid 32-bit overflows when proto-max-bulk-len is set high (#8522)
\* Fix an issue where a forked process deletes the parent's pidfile (#8231)
\* Fix flock cluster config may cause failure to restart after kill -9 (#7674)
\* Avoid an out-of-bounds read in the redis-sentinel (#7443)
Platform and deployment-related changes:
\* Fix setproctitle related crashes. (#8150, #8088)
Caused various crashes on startup, mainly on Apple M1 chips or under
instrumentation.
\* Add a check for an ARM64 Linux kernel bug (#8224)
Due to the potential severity of this issue, Redis will refuse to run on
affected platforms by default.
Modules:
\* RM\_ZsetRem: Delete key if empty, the bug could leave empty zset keys (#8453)
================================================================================
Redis 5.0.10 Released Mon Oct 26 09:21:49 IST 2020
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: SECURITY if you use an affected platform (see below).
Otherwise the upgrade urgency is MODERATE.
This release fixes a potential heap overflow when using a heap allocator other
than jemalloc or glibc's malloc. See:
https://github.com/redis/redis/pull/7963
Other fixes in this release:
\* Avoid case of Lua scripts being consistently aborted due to OOM
\* XPENDING will not update consumer's seen-time
\* A blocked XREADGROUP didn't propagated the XSETID to replicas / AOF
\* UNLINK support for streams
\* RESTORE ABSTTL won't store expired keys into the DB
\* Hide AUTH from MONITOR
\* Cluster: reduce spurious PFAIL/FAIL states upon delayed PONG receival
\* Cluster: Fix case of clusters mixing accidentally by gossip
\* Cluster: Allow blocked XREAD on a cluster replica
\* Cluster: Optimize memory usage CLUSTER SLOTS command
\* RedisModule\_ValueLength support for stream data type
\* Minor fixes in redis-check-rdb and redis-cli
\* Fix redis-check-rdb support for modules aux data
\* Add fsync in replica when full RDB payload was received

Redis 5.0.9 Released Thu Apr 17 12:41:00 CET 2020
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency:CRITICAL if you use Streams with AOF ore replicas.
Otherwise the upgrade urgency is LOW.
This release has a speed improvement and a critical fix:
\* FIX: XREADGROUP when fetching data in a blocking way, would not
emit the XCLAIM in the AOF file and to replicas. This means
that the last ID is not updated, and that restarting the server
will have the effect of reprocessing some entries.
\* NEW: Clients blocked on the same key are now unblocked on
O(1) time. Backported from Redis 6.
Commits:
1fc8ef81a Fix XCLAIM propagation in AOF/replicas for blocking XREADGROUP.
a5e24eabc Speedup: unblock clients on keys in O(1).
================================================================================

Redis 5.0.7 Released Tue Nov 19 17:52:44 CET 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: many issues fixed, some may have an impact.
Hi all, Redis 5.0.7 fixes a number of bugs, none is very critical, however
there are a few that may have an impact. It's a good idea to upgrade.
There are fixes in the area of replication from modules commands and
callbacks, AOF fsync (non critical issue), memory leaks (very rare and small),
streams beahvior (non critical), and a potential crash in commands
processing multiple keys at the same time that is there for years, and happens
very rarely, but is not impossible to trigger.

Redis 5.0.6 Released Wed Sep 25 12:33:56 CEST 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Only in case of exposed instances to untrusted users.
This Redis release, 5.0.6, is a bugfix and enhancement release. The most
important bugfix is a corruption related to the HyperLogLog. A malformed
HyperLogLog string could cause an invalid access to the memory. At a first
glance the vulnerability appears to be not exploitable but just a DoS. The
way to trigger the issue is complex, we'll not provide any information about
how to do that for the users safety.
Other significant changes in this release:
\* New modules APIs merged from Redis unstable to Redis 5.
\* Some memory optimization related to objects creation.
\* Fixes to flushSlaveOutputBuffer() that make sure that SHUTDOWN will
transfer pending buffers to replicas.

Redis 5.0.5 Released Wed May 15 17:57:41 CEST 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes an important AOF fysnc bug
and other less critical issues.
Dear user,
Redis 5.0.5 fixes an important issue with AOF and adds multiple very useful
modules APIs. Moreover smaller bugs in other parts of Redis are fixed in
this release.
The AOF bug
-----------
The AOF bug happens when the fsync policy is set to "everysec", which is the
default: if the write load in the server drops immediately, the commands
executed in the latest second may not be fsync-ed to disk as it should.
This may lead to data loss in case the write load drops immediately and
successively a server crash happens.
Other things in this release
----------------------------
\* Streams: a bug in the iterator could prevent certain items to be returned in
range queries under specific conditions.
\* Memleak in bitfieldCommand fixed.
\* Modules API: Preserve client->id for blocked clients.
\* Fix memory leak when rewriting config file in case of write errors.
\* New modules API: RedisModule\_GetKeyNameFromIO().
\* Fix non critical bugs in diskless replication.
\* New mdouels API: command filtering. See RedisModule\_RegisterCommandFilter();
\* Tests improved to be more deterministic.
\* Fix a Redis Cluster bug, manual failover may abort because of the master
sending PINGs to the replicas.
The following is the full list of commmits.
Regards,
Salvatore

Redis 5.0.4 Released Mon Mar 18 17:12:53 CET 2019
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: This release fixes several Redis stability issues.
Dear Redis users, this release includes a number of fixes for bugs that may
result in Redis crashing in special conditions (not normal usage, but specific
artificial conditions), fixes to certain Redis behaviors especially around
Redis streams, and finally a set of new APIs for Redis Modules.
Specifically:
\* Hyperloglog different coding errors leading to potential crashes were fixed.
\* A replication bug leading to a potential crash in case of plain misuse of handshake commands was fixed.
\* XCLAIM command incrementing of number of deliveries was fixed.
\* LFU field management in objects was improved.
\* A potential overflow in the redis-check-aof was fixed.
\* A memory leak in case of API misuse was fixed.
\* ZPOP\* behavior when count is 0 is fixed.
\* A few redis-cli --cluster bugs were fixed, plus a few improvements.
\* Many other smaller bugs.
We suggest to upgrade Redis, especially in case your instance is facing
untrusted users (for instance Cloud providers) because several of these
bugs could result in unwanted crashes.

Redis 5.0.3 Released Tue Dec 11 18:17:26 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Redis 5 is consolidating, upgrading is a good idea.
However there is nothing very critical here, but certain
issues resolved could lead to very rare crashes.
Welcome to Redis 5.0.3, several interesting bug fixes here:
\* Redis no longer panics when you send data to a replica-mode connection that
is in MONITOR or SYNC mode.
\* Fixes to certain sorted set edge cases. You are unlikely to ever notice those
issues, but now it is more correct.
\* Certain BSD variants now are better supported: build & register logging
on crash.
\* The networking core now recovers if an IPv6 address is listed in bind but
is actually not able to work because there is no such protocol in the
system.
\* redis-cli cluster mode improved in many ways. Especially the fix subcommand
work was enhanced to cover other edge cases that were still not covered
after the work done for Redis 5.
\* MEMORY USAGE is now more accurate.
\* DEBUG DIGEST-VALUE added in case you want to make sure a given set of keys
(and not the whole DB) are excatly the same between two instances.
\* Fix a potential crash in the networking code related to recent changes
to the way the reply is consumed.
\* Reject EXEC containing write commands against an instance that changed role
from master to replica during our transaction.
\* Fix a crash in KEYS and other commands using pattern matching, in an edge
case where the pattern contains a zero byte.
\* Fix eviction during AOF loading due to maxmemory triggered by commands
executed in loading state.
The following is the list of commmits if you want to check credits or dig
further in the details.
commit 2c6ee0f9b3d9ca48c6da8bd18796186784216bff
Author: antirez
Date: Wed Dec 12 11:37:15 2018 +0100
freeMemoryIfNeeded() small refactoring.
Related to issue #5686 and PR #5689.
commit 107e93e75acfd5def0252efb6870751940816395
Author: zhaozhao.zz
Date: Wed Dec 12 00:25:24 2018 +0800
evict: don't care about mem if loading
When loading data, we call processEventsWhileBlocked
to process events and execute commands.
But if we are loading AOF it's dangerous, because
processCommand would call freeMemoryIfNeeded to evict,
and that will break data consistency, see issue #5686.

Redis 5.0.2 Released Thu Nov 22 11:22:37 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: CRITICAL if you use streams and consumer groups.
HIGH if you use redis-cli with Redis Cluster.
LOW otherwise.
Welcome to Redis 5.0.2. This release fixes two issues with Streams consumer
groups, where items could be returned duplicated by XREADGROUP when accessing
the history, and another bug where XREADGROUP can report some history even
if the comsumer pending list is empty. Both problems were addressed and unit
tests to avoid regressions implemented. Moreover this release fixes some
issue with redis-cli when in cluster mode. Finally some FreeBSD and DragonFly
build problems are now resolved. The list of the commits is below.
Enjoy,
Salvatore

================================================================================
Redis 5.0.1 Released Wed Nov 07 13:09:30 CET 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency: URGENT if you use Redis Streams. MODERATE otherwise.
Hi all, this is the first patch level release of Redis 5. It contains
both fixes and improvements. Here there is a list of the major ones, however
read the commit messages at the end of the changelog if you want to know
more about the smaller things. Let's start with the new features:
\* Sentinel now supports authentication! Check the Sentinel official doc
for more info.
\* Redis-cli cluster "fix" is now able to fix a big number of clusters put
in a bad condition. Previously many corner cases were not covered.
Now the critical fixes:
1. Fix RESTORE mismatch reply when certain keys already expired.
2. Fix an XCLAIM non trivial issue: sometimes the command returned a wrong
entry or desynchronized the protocol.
And now the other fixes:
3. Stack trace generation on the Raspberry PI (and 32bit ARM) fixed.
4. Don't evict expired keys when the KEYS command is called, in order to
avoid a mass deletion event. However expired keys are not displayed
by KEYS as usually.
5. Improvements in the computation of the memory used, when estimating
the AOF buffers.
6. XRANGE COUNT of 0 fixed.
7. "key misses" stats accounting fixed. Many cache misses were not counted.
8. When in MULTI state, return OOM while accumulating commands and there
is no longer memory available.
9. Fix build on FreeBSD and possibly others.
10. Fix a crash in Redis modules, thread safe context reply accumulation.
11. Fix a race condition when producing the RDB file for full SYNC.
12. Disable protected mode in Sentinel.
13. More commands now have the HELP subcommand.
14. Fixed an issue about adaptive server HZ timer.
15. Fix cluster-replica-no-failover option name.
Finally, this is the list of commits. Enjoy Redis 5.0.1!

Redis 5.0.0 Released Wed Oct 17 13:28:26 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: Several fixes to streams AOF and replication.
Hi all and welcome to the first stable release of Redis 5! \o/
To start a quick recap of what's new in Redis 5:
1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
- Better propagation of Lua scripts to replicas / AOF.
- Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the replica as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.
However the list above really does not do justice to the changes of Redis 5
since the core was improved in many ways during the development of the new
version. However certain changes were back ported into Redis 4 once they were
sensed as safe, because many improvements were hard to distinguish from fixes.
The most important user facing improvement is without doubts the introduction
of the new general purpose data type after years: the streams.
Note that we worked to improve and fix streams till a few hours ago, so while
we are not aware of critical bugs in this release, surely there is to handle it
with some care for the first weeks. Bug reporting will be highly appreciated and
we are ready to work immediately to release 5.0.1 once there is enough important
stuff to justify a new release (probably soon).
People not using the streams can have probably a better production-ready
experience with Redis 5, also because many internals are shared with Redis 4
so the jump is not as big as it was between 3.2 and 4 in terms of how things
internally work.
Well, many thanks to the Redis community and the developers that made
this release possible, contributing bug reports, patches, new features, working
on the clients, sometimes debugging problems for days. Also thank to everybody
that adopted Redis for their use cases making things work for users worldwide.
The list of commits in this release follows.
Cheers,
Salvatore

Redis 5.0-rc6 Released Wed Oct 10 11:03:54 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Many bugs fixed especially in the context of streams.
This is probably the last release candidate of Redis 5. The Redis 5 GA version
will be released 17th of October. The main highlights of this release are:
\* Critical AOF bug, as old as AOF itself: if an open MULTI/EXEC block is at
the end of the AOF file, Redis would still read the half-transaction when
reloading back the AOF.
\* The slave name was removed from logs and documentation, now replica is used
instead.
\* LOLWUT command added.
\* New modules APIs: Disable Redis Cluster redirection.
\* New modules APIs: Sorted dictionaries data type.
\* Modules APIs fixes: timer / cluster messages callback now can call RM\_Call().
\* Fix for #5024 - commandstats for multi-exec were logged as EXEC.
\* A number of optimizations and fixes for the stream data type.
\* Many other stability improvements.

Redis 5.0 RC5 Released Thu Sep 06 12:54:29 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency HIGH: Several imporant bugs fixed.
Hi all,
This is the release candidate number five, and has a lot of bug fixes inside,
together with a few big changes to the Redis behavior from the point of view
of replication of scripts and handling of the maxmemory directive in slaves.
Make sure to read the whole list!
\* BREAKING BEHAVIOR: Slaves now ignore maxmemory by default.
\* BREAKING BEHAVIOR: Now scripts are always replicated for their effects, and
never sending the script itself to slaves/AOF.
\* Improvement: Big pipelining performances improved significantly.
\* Fix: Rewrite BRPOPLPUSH as RPOPLPUSH to propagate.
\* Fix: False positives in tests.
\* Fix: Certain command flags were modified because not correct.
\* Fix: Fix blocking XREAD for streams that are empty.
\* Improvement: Allow scripts to timeout on slaves as well.
\* Fix: Different corner cases due to CLIENT PAUSE are now fixed.
\* Improvement: Optimize parsing large bulk greater than 32k.
\* Fix: Propagate read-only scripts as SCRIPT LOAD, not as EVAL.
The following is the list of commits, so that you can read the details and
check the credits of the commits.

Redis 5.0 RC4 Released Fri Aug 03 13:51:02 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency
HIGH: Many non critical but important issues fixed.
CRITICAL for Stream users: Many important bugs fixed.
Hi all, welcome to Redis 5.0 RC4.
This release is a huge step forward in Redis 5 maturity and fixes a number
of issues. It also provides interesting improvements. Here I'll summarize
the biggest one, but laster you can find the full list of commits:
Fixes:
\* A number of fixes related to Streams: stability and correctnes.
\* Fix dbRandomKey() potential infinite loop.
\* Improve eviction LFU/LRU when keys are created by INCR commands family.
\* Active defragmentation is now working on Redis 5.
\* Fix corner case in Redis CLuster / Sentinel failover, by resetting the
disconnection time with master in a more appropriate place.
\* Use a private version of localtime() to avoid potential deadlocks.
\* Different redis-cli non critical fixes.
\* Fix rare replication stream corruption with disk-based replication.
Improvements:
\* Sentinel: add an option to deny online script reconfiguration.
\* Improved RESTORE command.
\* Sentinel command renaming: allows to use Sentinel with Redis instances
that have non standard command names.
\* CLIENT ID and CLIENT UNBLOCK.
\* CLIENT LIST now supports a TYPE option.
\* redis-cli --cluster now supports authentication.
\* redis-trib is now deprecated (use redis-cli --cluster).
\* Better slaves output buffers efficiency.
\* Faster INFO when there are many clients connected.
\* Dynamic HZ feature.
\* Improvements in what the MEMORY command is able to report.
\* Add year in log. (WARNING: may be incompatible with log scraping tools)
\* Lazy freeing now works even when values are overwritten (for instance SET).
\* Faster ZADD when elements scores are updated.
\* Improvements to the test suite, including many new options.

Redis 5.0 RC3 Released Wed Jun 14 9:51:44 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW:
This release fixes compilation of Redis RC2. For an error the commit from unstable
updating the Rax library was not merged into the 5.0 branch.
================================================================================
Redis 5.0 RC2 Released Wed Jun 13 12:49:13 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency CRITICAL: This release fixes important security issues.
HIGH: This release fixes a SCAN commands family bug.
MODERATE: This release fixes a PSYNC2 edge case with expires.
MODERATE: Sentinel related fixes.
LOW: All the other issues
NOTE: This release breaks API compatibility with certain APIs that were
introduced in Redis 5.0 RC1. Notably ZPOP\* now returns score/element in reverse
order. XINFO  special form was removed, now XINFO STREAM  must be
used to obtain general information about the stream.
Redis 5.0 RC2 ixes a number of important issues:
\* Important security issues related to the Lua scripting engine.
Please check https://github.com/antirez/redis/issues/5017
for more information.
\* A bug with SCAN, SSCAN, HSCAN and ZSCAN, that may not return all the elements.
We also add a regression test that can trigger the issue often when present, and
may in theory be able to find unrelated regressions.
\* A PSYNC2 bug is fixed: Redis should not expire keys when saving RDB files
because otherwise it is no longer possible to use such RDB file as a base
for partial resynchronization. It no longer represents the right state.
\* Compatibility of AOF with RDB preamble when the RDB checksum is disabled.
\* Sentinel bug that in some cases prevented Sentinel to detect that the master
was down immediately. A delay was added to the detection.
\* XREADGROUP would crash when the master had attacked slaves.
\* Replication and events generation of several streams command were fixed.
\* XREVRANGE fixed, in some cases it could not return elements, or crash the
server, or in general not behave correctly.
\* ZPOP can now unblock multiple clients in a sane way.
\* Other minor issues.
Moreover this release adds new features:
\* XGROUP DESTROY and XGROUP SETID.
\* RDB loading speedup.
\* Configurable stream macro node limits (number of elements / bytes).
\* More smaller improvements.
The following is the list of commits composing the release, please check
the commit messages and authors for credits.

Redis 5.0 RC1 Released Tue May 29 14:14:11 CEST 2018
================================================================================
Upgrade urgency LOW: This is the first RC of Redis 5.
Introduction to the Redis 5 release
===================================
Redis 5 is a release focused on a few important features. While Redis 4
was very very focused on operations, Redis 5 changes are mostly user-facing,
with the implementation of new data types and operations on top of existing
types. The following are the major features of this release:
1. The new Stream data type. https://redis.io/topics/streams-intro
2. New Redis modules APIs: Timers, Cluster and Dictionary APIs.
3. RDB now store LFU and LRU information.
4. The cluster manager was ported from Ruby (redis-trib.rb) to C code
inside redis-cli. Check `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
5. New sorted set commands: ZPOPMIN/MAX and blocking variants.
6. Active defragmentation version 2.
7. Improvemenets in HyperLogLog implementations.
8. Better memory reporting capabilities.
9. Many commands with sub-commands now have an HELP subcommand.
10. Better performances when clients connect and disconnect often.
11. Many bug fixes and other random improvements.
12. Jemalloc was upgraded to version 5.1
13. CLIENT UNBLOCK and CLIENT ID.
14. The LOLWUT command was added. http://antirez.com/news/123
15. We no longer use the "slave" word if not for API backward compatibility.
16. Differnet optimizations in the networking layer.
17. Lua improvements:
- Better propagation of Lua scripts to slaves / AOF.
- Lua scripts can now timeout and get in -BUSY state in the slave as well.
18. Dynamic HZ to balance idle CPU usage with responsiveness.
19. The Redis core was refactored and improved in many ways.
Thanks to all the users and developers who made this release possible.
We'll follow up with more RC releases, until the code looks production ready
and we don't get reports of serious issues for a while.

Migrating from 4.0 to 5.0
=========================
Redis 4.0 is mostly a strict subset of 5.0, you should not have any problem
upgrading your application from 4.0 to 5.0. However this is a list of small
non-backward compatible changes introduced in the 5.0 release:
\* redis-cli now implements the cluster management tool. We still ship the
old redis-trib, but new fixes will be implemented only in redis-cli.
See `redis-cli --cluster help` for more info.
\* The RDB format changed. Redis 5.0 is still able to read 4.0 (and all the
past versions) files, but not the other way around.
\* Certain log formats and sentences are different in Redis 5.0.
\* Now by default maxmemory is ignored by slaves, and used only once a slave
is promoted to master. It means that in setups where you want slaves to
enforce maxmemory in an independent way from the master (that will anyway
stream the key eviction DEL commands), you should active this feature manually
and make sure you understand that it breaks consistency if writes are not
always idempotent. TLDR: the new behavior is much better for 99.999% of use
cases, revert it if you really know what you are doing.
\* Scripts are only replicated by their \*effects\* and not by sending EVAL/EVALSHA
to slaves or the AOF log itself. This is much better in the general case
and in the future we want to totally remove the other possiblity of
propagating scripts the old way (as EVAL). However you can still turn this
back to the default via the non-documented (if not here) Redis configuration
directive "lua-replicate-commands yes" or
"DEBUG lua-always-replicate-commands 0". However note that Redis 6 may
completely remove such feature.
\* Because of the above change related to scripts replication, certain Redis
commands that in Redis 4 had their result ordered lexicographically before
being passed to Lua via the return value of redis.call(), now have a behavior
more similar to calling the commands directly from a normal client. For
instance the ordering of elements returned by SMEMBERS or SDIFF is now
undetermined in Lua, exactly as it is by default when calling the commands
from a non-scripting context.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Credits: For each release, a list of changes with the relative author is
provided. Where not specified the implementation and design is done by
Salvatore Sanfilippo. Thanks to Redis Labs for making all this possible.
Also many thanks to all the other contributors and the amazing community
we have.
Commit messages may contain additional credits.
Enjoy,
Salvatore

When are those going to be fixed?](#cve-severity-assessment)- [What does local (remote) mean?](#localremote)

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 444 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2684313.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 30 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  24 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (July 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2679563.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2679563.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 14 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  10 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujul2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the July 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update July 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2664876.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id= 2664876.1).
