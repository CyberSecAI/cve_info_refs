# Beaker builder

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-06-22/#SECURITY-2248)**This plugin is up for adoption!** We are looking for new maintainers. Visit our [Adopt a Plugin](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/) initiative for more information.

* [Documentation](/beaker-builder/)
* [Releases](/beaker-builder/releases/)
* [Issues](/beaker-builder/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/beaker-builder/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/beaker-builder/healthscore/)

This plugin ingrates Jenkins with [Beaker](http://beaker-project.org/).

Beaker is open-source software for managing and automating labs of test
computers. Plugin allows you to submit a job definition to Beaker and
get back the result.

Current plugin capabilities are

* schedule a job (includeing matrix job) in Beaker based on provided
  job XML definition, job definition can be provided
  + directly in Jenkins job configuration
  + as a path to a file in workspace (e.g. previously checked out
    from SCM)
* expand parameters in job XML definition based on Jenkins job
  parameters or environment variables
* monitor the Beaker job and sets the job status according to Beaker
  job result
* add link to Beaker job on build page
* export job ID as an environment variable for further usage (e.g. in
  subsequent shell build step)
* download job files from Beaker into workspace

# Configuration

In the main Jenkins configuration page you have to setup URL to Beaker
and also credential (login/password) under which Jenkins logs-in into
the Beaker. Kerberos authentication is currently not supported (will be
hopefully in next versions).
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_config.png)

### Dealing with certificate and keystore

Usually XML-RPC calls which this plugin uses for communication with
Beaker are sent over https protocol. If you use **https protocol**, make
sure you have set up java **keystore with valid certificate**, it means
you have added Beaker certificate into you java keystore and provide
path and password of the keystore to webserver. To add certificate into
java keystore, save the certificate (e.g. export the certificate from
your web browser) and run

```
keytool -import -keystore my_java_keystore.jks -file beaker_cert.pem -alias beaker-server

```

To verify that the certificate was imported you can run following
command which will list all entries in the keystore

```
keytool -list -keystore my_java_keystore.jks

```

Now add following java options to your Jenkins java options (or server
JVM options when running on different container than Winstone)

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<passwd>

```
### Configuration issues

When you use Java 7, you may observe following issue in the log:

```
Jul 31, 2013 12:21:59 AM org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector executeWithRetry
INFO: I/O exception (javax.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException) caught when processing request: handshake alert:  unrecognized_name
Jul 31, 2013 12:21:59 AM org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodDirector executeWithRetry
INFO: Retrying request

```

To avoid it, turn off
[SNI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication) by adding
java option *-Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false* so that java options which
needs to be add to Jenkins cofing are following:

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/path/to/keystore.jks -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<passwd> -Djsse.enableSNIExtension=false

```
# Usage

Add "Beaker buidler"  build step:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_usage1.png)

Define job XML or provide path to job XML definition file. Job XML
definition can contain parameters which will be expanded before
submitting job XML to Beaker:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_usage2.png)

You can also specify path to job XML, which can include job parameters
or env. variables. This is useful e.g. in cases when you job definition
is different for various architectures or OS distributions. This is
especially useful in case of matrix jobs, when values of matrix axes are
exported as env. variables, so you can take advantage of matrix jobs
even if you job definition is different for each matrix combination.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_param_path.png)

In subsequent tasks you can use BEAKER\_JOB\_ID parameter which will
contain submitted job ID in Beaker:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_usage3.png)

 Once you schedule a build and job is successfully submitted to the
Beaker server, new link pointing to the job will appear in build menu:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_usage4.png)

Plugin will monitor th execution of Beaker job periodically, will send
notification to the Jenkins build console and will set the job result
according to Beaker job result:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_usage5.png)

### Additional actions

You can also configure additional actions, currently only downloading
job files from Beaker:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_download_files_cfg.png)

The files are downloaded into $WORKSPACE/beaker/J\_$BEAKER\_JOB\_ID:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/beaker-builder/docs/images/beaker_download_files.png)

SECURITY-1534 / CVE-2019-10392
Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation
of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the
specified URL. This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the
Jenkins master as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

SECURITY-1538 / CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
any of the following:

- Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
- Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of
  assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
- Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement
  expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
- Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not
  involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1476 / CVE-2019-10395
Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables
shown on its views. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment
variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

SECURITY-1489 / CVE-2019-10396
Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest
Builds View. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on
that view.

SECURITY-1509 / CVE-2019-10397
Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job
configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1545 / CVE-2019-10398
Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins
master. This password could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

* [Aqua Security Serverless Scanner
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-serverless)
* [Beaker builder
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/beaker-builder)
* [Build Environment
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-environment)

## Descriptions

### System command execution vulnerability in Git client Plugin

**SECURITY-1534
/
CVE-2019-10392**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-client`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client)**

**Description:**

Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the specified URL.
This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the Jenkins controller as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

Git client Plugin now rejects repository URLs that do not appear to be valid URLs.
Additionally, for versions of Git that support it, the repository URL argument is separated from option arguments using the `--` separator to prevent interpretation as an option.

As of publication of this advisory, no update for users of prerelease versions of 3.x such as 3.0.0-rc is available.
Users of Git client Plugin 3.0.0-rc are advised to downgrade to 2.8.5 (and downgrade [Git Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git) from 4.0.0-rc to the latest 3.x release to resolve dependency problems).

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1538
/
CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through any of the following:

* Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
* Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
* Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
* Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Build Environment Plugin

**SECURITY-1476
/
CVE-2019-10395**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`build-environment`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-environment)**

**Description:**

Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables shown on its views.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

Build Environment Plugin now escapes all variables displayed in its views.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Dashboard View Plugin

**SECURITY-1489
/
CVE-2019-10396**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dashboard-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dashboard-view)**

**Description:**

Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest Builds View.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on that view.

Dashboard View Plugin now applies the configured markup formatter to the build description, rendering it as it appears elsewhere in Jenkins.

### Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin showed plain text password in job configuration form fields

**SECURITY-1509
/
CVE-2019-10397**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`aqua-serverless`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-serverless)**

**Description:**

Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin no longer transmits the password form field in plain text.

### Beaker builder Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1545
/
CVE-2019-10398**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`beaker-builder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/beaker-builder)**

**Description:**

Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Beaker builder Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1476:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1489:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1509:
