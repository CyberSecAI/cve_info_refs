{
  "CVE-2019-10217": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in ansible 2.8.0 before 2.8.4. Fields managing sensitive data should be set as such by no_log feature. Some of these fields in GCP modules are not set properly. service_account_contents() which is common class for all gcp modules is not setting no_log to True. Any sensitive data managed by that function would be leak as an output when running ansible playbooks.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "2.8.0",
      "2.8.1",
      "2.8.2",
      "2.8.3"
    ],
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The `service_account_contents()` function in Ansible's GCP modules was not configured to mask sensitive data via the `no_log` parameter, leading to potential credential exposure.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of sensitive data",
        "Lack of masking of credentials in logs"
      ],
      "impact": "Disclosure of sensitive data, such as service account credentials, through Ansible's output when running playbooks with increased verbosity.",
      "attack_vectors": "Exploitation occurs through local access by running Ansible playbooks that use the affected GCP modules and have verbosity enabled.",
       "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be able to run Ansible playbooks locally on a system where the sensitive data is being used and has access to the generated output."
    },
    "fix_details": {
      "fixed_versions": [
          "2.8.4",
          "2.9.6",
          "2.9.14"
      ],
      "fix_description": "The vulnerability was fixed by properly setting the no_log parameter to True in the service_account_contents() function, ensuring that sensitive data is masked in Ansible's output."
