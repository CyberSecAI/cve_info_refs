Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10952:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability within the Rockwell Automation CompactLogix 5370 programmable automation controllers. This is caused by sending a specially crafted HTTP/HTTPS request

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to send crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests that can render the web server unavailable. This can also cause a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability leading to remote code execution.
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** While CVE-2019-10952 is linked to uncontrolled resource consumption, the description also mentions that exploiting this can lead to remote code execution caused by a stack-based buffer overflow. This means that they are related but are not the same vulnerability. Additionally, a separate stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists when sending crafted SMTP packets, which is assigned CVE-2019-10954.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation can render the web server unavailable, requiring a cold restart to recover the system. In addition to the DoS, successful exploitation can also lead to Remote Code Execution.
*   **Major Non-Recoverable Faulted State (MNRF):** The stack-based buffer overflow via crafted SMTP packets (CVE-2019-10954) can cause the controller to enter a major non-recoverable faulted state.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerabilities remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/HTTPS requests to the target device for CVE-2019-10952, and send crafted SMTP packets for CVE-2019-10954.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack complexity is low, suggesting that exploiting the vulnerabilities is relatively straightforward once the attacker has the ability to send the specific crafted packets.
*   **No Privileges Needed:** No authentication or special privileges are required to carry out the attack.

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory mentions the use of crafted HTTP/HTTPS and SMTP packets, and the impact of the vulnerabilities as a denial-of-service condition or placing the controller in a major non-recoverable faulted state.
*   The advisory provides a link to the Rockwell Automation security advisory, and recommends applying the latest firmware (FRN 31.011).
*   Mitigation strategies involve network segmentation, access controls, and blocking specific ports (80/443/TCP for web-based vulnerabilities and ports 2222/TCP/UDP and 44818/TCP/UDP for EtherNet/IP based vulnerabilities). Additionally, it is recommended to filter SMTP traffic from untrusted sources.
*   The vulnerabilities were reported by Younes Dragoni of Nozomi Networks and George Lashenko of CyberX.
