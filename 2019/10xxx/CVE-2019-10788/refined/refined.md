Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10788:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw in the `im-metadata` package. The package uses ImageMagick's `identify` command to retrieve image metadata, and it passes user-provided input (the image path) directly to the `exec` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core weakness is the lack of input sanitization before passing the file path to the `exec` function, which executes shell commands. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands by crafting a malicious file path containing shell metacharacters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where the vulnerable code is running. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
  - Data exfiltration
  - System compromise
  - Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is the image path argument provided to the `im-metadata` package. By injecting shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&`, etc.) into the path, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the input path provided to the `im-metadata` library. This could be through user-supplied input in a web application or any other mechanism where the path is user-controlled or influenced and passed to `im-metadata`.
- The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit this vulnerability, once they can influence the vulnerable parameter they can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding input validation using a regular expression to check for the presence of suspicious characters in the path argument before executing the ImageMagick command.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided in the Snyk report, demonstrating how a malicious path can be used to inject arbitrary commands.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High) according to Snyk and 9.8 (Critical) according to NVD, highlighting the severity of this command injection issue.

The fix included in the commit `ea15ddd` adds the following check :
```
if(/;|&|`|\$|\(|\)|\|\||\||!|>|<|\?|\${/g.test(JSON.stringify(path))) {
    console.log('Input Validation failed, Suspicious Characters found');
  } else {
      // ... execute command
}
```
This regular expression attempts to block shell metacharacters before the `path` variable is used in a shell command.
