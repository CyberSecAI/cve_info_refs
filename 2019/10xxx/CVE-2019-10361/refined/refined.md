Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10361:

**Root Cause:**

The Maven Release Plug-in for Jenkins stored credentials in plain text within its global configuration file `org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.m2release.M2ReleaseBuildWrapper.xml` on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The plugin failed to encrypt sensitive credentials, storing them in plain text in a configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could view the unencrypted credentials. This could include users with "Extended Read" permissions or direct access to the server.
*   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Exposed credentials could potentially be used to access other systems or resources if they were reused.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could directly access the configuration file containing the plain text credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker with "Extended Read" permissions within Jenkins could potentially access the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system or have "Extended Read" permissions within Jenkins.
*   No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability once the attacker has the necessary access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Maven Release Plug-in.
*   The issue was addressed by encrypting the credentials when stored.
*   The severity of this vulnerability is considered Low according to the CVSS score (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) .
*   The plugin version affected was up to and including 0.14.0.
*   The fix was included in version 0.15.0 of the plugin.
