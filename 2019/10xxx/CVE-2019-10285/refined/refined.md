Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10285:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Minio Storage Plugin stores credentials in an unencrypted format.
*   **Weakness:** Credentials, specifically the Minio server URL, AccessKey and SecretKey, are stored in plain text within the plugin's global configuration file (`org.jenkinsci.plugins.minio.MinioUploader.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view these credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker would need access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file and extract the plain-text credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker requires direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved via compromised credentials or a vulnerability allowing file system access.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in versions up to and including 0.0.3 of the plugin.
*   The severity is rated as "Low" with a CVSS score of AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates that the vulnerability can be exploited locally with low privileges, low complexity, no user interaction and with a low impact to confidentiality.
