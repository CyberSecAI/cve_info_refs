### Relevant Information:
CVE-2019-10278 is related to a security vulnerability in the jenkins-reviewbot Plugin.

**Vulnerability:**
A missing permission check in a form validation method allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials. Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

**Affected Plugin:**
jenkins-reviewbot Plugin

**Attack vector:**
An attacker could exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user with Overall/Read permissions into clicking a malicious link or visiting a malicious website, leading to the initiation of a connection test to an attacker-specified URL.

**Impact:**
An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials, potentially leading to SSRF and information disclosure.
