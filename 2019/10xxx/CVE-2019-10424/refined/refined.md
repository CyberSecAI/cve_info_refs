Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The elOyente plugin stores the XMPP password unencrypted in its global configuration file (`com.technicolor.eloyente.ElOyente.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary weakness is that the XMPP password is not encrypted when stored on the Jenkins controller's file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the plaintext password.
- **Compromise of XMPP Account:**  The exposed XMPP password can be used by an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the XMPP account configured in the plugin, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate XMPP Pub/Sub events and trigger jobs, extract data, or even disrupt the Jenkins environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system (e.g., through a compromised account or other system vulnerabilities) can obtain the plaintext password.
- **Extended Read Permission**: Users with 'Extended Read' permission can view the file if it is stored in job config.xml files.
- **XSS vulnerability:** An attacker with XSS vulnerability can potentially steal the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access**: The attacker needs to gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file.
- **Extended Read Permission**: The attacker needs to have extended read access.
- **XSS Vulnerability Exploit**: The attacker needs to be able to exploit an existing XSS vulnerability to steal the password.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on Jenkins.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states that as of the publication date, there was no fix available for this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as Low severity.
- The provided documentation provides details on how the plugin works, and configuration details but does not explain the vulnerability itself.
