# elOyente

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Credentials stored in plain text](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-09-25/#SECURITY-1561)

* [Documentation](/elOyente/)
* [Releases](/elOyente/releases/)
* [Issues](/elOyente/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/elOyente/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/elOyente/healthscore/)

This plug-in adds job triggering based on XMPP Pub/Sub events.

# Features

This plugin allows Jenkins jobs to:

* Subscribe for XMPP Pub/Sub events, to trigger the job.
* Add filter expressions in XPath notation, to limit the triggering to
  particular events.
* Extract data from the events with XPath expressions, and make it a
  vailable as environment variables.

## Prerequisites

It is required to set up or to have access to an XMPP server in charge
of handling the events and messages. There exist several available
servers that could be used. Follow this
[website](http://xmpp.org/xmpp-software/servers/?_sm_au_=iVVvfV5TJ0PJJ470)
to find some examples.

For the development of the plug-in, it has been used **Openfire**. This
sever is quite easy to set up and use. For more information, visit its
[website](http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/), where you
can find the [installation
guide](http://www.igniterealtime.org/builds/openfire/docs/latest/documentation/install-guide.html?_sm_au_=iVVvfV5TJ0PJJ470).

# Configuration and use

## Installation guide

To install ElOyente, just follow these easy steps:

1. Start Jenkins, and once in the dashboard, click on **Manage Jenkins**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image1.png)

2. Then select **Manage Plugins**

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image2.png)

3. Select the **Available** tab.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image3.png)

4. Scroll down to the section **Build Triggers**, there you’ll find
ElOyente.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image4.png)

5. After clicking **Download and install after restart** the plug-in
will be installed and ready to be used.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image5.png)

# Using the plug-in

## Main configuration

In order to set the plug-in to work it is necessary to fill the
parameters of the server we are going to use, this is done in the main
configuration.

To access the main configuration of Jenkins, click in **Manage Jenkins**
and after that in **Configure System**.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image6.png)

This will open a menu like the one below, search for the section XMPP
job triggering. There you can specify the server address of your XMPP
server, a user and a password.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image7.png)

As you can see the interface will give you feedback about the connection
and authentication. In the example, as the server is not valid, it
cannot connect, and as the user and password are not correct it shows
that you are not authenticated.

Once these parameters have been set we are ready to use the plug-in
within our projects.

**NOTE:**: If these values are empty or not correct, still you'll be
able to use the plug-in in the projects, but of course the connection
won't be created and they won't react to any possible events. You can
set the main configuration parameters later and once you click Save,
you'll start receiving the XMPP events.

## Configuring a job

These are the steps needed to create a job and set up ElOyente plug-in
for listening to XMPP events.

First create the job and give it a name, it doesn't matter the type of
job you're creating, the plug-in will always be available.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image9.png)

Once created, you'll see the configuration screen, scroll down to the
section Triggers, and click on the checkbox labelled as **XMPP triggered
plug-in** to activate it. Then click on **Add subscriptions** and you
are ready to subscribe to the nodes from which you'll receive your
events.

Just write on the textbox the name of one of the nodes available in your
XMPP server, you can add more nodes if needed, just clicking on **Add
subscription** as many times as you need. In case you need to delete one
of the nodes just click on the **Delete subscription** button on the
right side under the subscription you want to delete.

Once you click the **Save** button the plug-in will be listening for the
XMPP events over the nodes you selected. The job will be triggered as
soon as you receive an event from those nodes.

**NOTE:** It is possible to subscribe to nodes that still don't exist,
once they are created the plugin will start listening when clicking on
the **Save** button in the configuration of that particular job, or in
the **Save** button of the main configuration.

You can also subscribe several times to the same node in one particular
job, in that case a build will be triggered for each of the
subscriptions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image10.png)

## Setting up filters

There are 3 types of Pub/Sub systems: topic based, attribute based and
content based. Topic based is the easiest, and any Pub/Sub system
supports it. El Oyente is designed to put minimal requirements on the
messaging infrastructure, but provide fine grained triggering
capabilities. As such, El Oyente only uses topic-based subscriptions,
but provides client-side filters to have a full content-based Pub/Sub
infrastructure.

Under the node subscriptions we see a textbox where you can add a filter
for that particular subscription. If empty, the job will be triggered
for any event occurring on the selected node. The filter expression
allows the job to be triggered only if the event matches a certain
criteria. The filter is anexpression in [XPath
notation](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/?_sm_au_=iVVvfV5TJ0PJJ470), which
is applied on the XMPP event. If the expression evaluates to true, the
job is triggered. See XEP-0060 for more information about [XMPP
Pub/Sub](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html).

In the image below you can see a subscription to a node "cocktails", the
filter is set so only the cocktails from Spain will trigger the job.
When an XMPP message is received it is filtered, if the plug-in finds
the tag origin with a value of Spain, the triggered will be fired, in
other case, the job will not be triggered.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image11.png)

## Using environment variables

The plug-in also allows you to save information from the event into
environment variables that can be referred in the rest of the job, you
can add as many as you want.

To set an environment variable you must click in the button **Add
variable** and two fields will appear.

The first field tagged as **Name** lets you choose a name for the
variable, this variable can be referred in the rest of the job with the
$ operator.

The second field **Value selection** allows specifying an [XPath
expression](http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/?_sm_au_=iVVvfV5TJ0PJJ470), which
will be applied on the XMPP event. The result of this will be used as
the value for the environment variable.

In the example it is extracted the name of the cocktail, a list of steps
for preparation, an URL that contains the image and a list of
ingredients. All this information is extracted from the payload of the
XMPP message received and could be used for example to fill an HTML file
that shows the cocktail characteristics.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/elOyente/docs/images/image12.png)

# Testing

To test the plugin, the following tool can be used to send XMPP events
to a server:
[xmpp\_publisher](https://github.com/vanderhallenf/xmpp_publisher).

Arguments:

-s <server>                -> URL of the XMPP server

-u <username>          -> User name to connect to the XMPP server

-p <password>           -> Password to connect to the XMPP server

-n <node>                  -> Name of the node to publish to

-m <message>           -> Message to publish

-d                              -> Enable the debugger

-h                              -> Show this help

Example:

```
./run.sh -s beatles.albums.com -u Paul -p Beatles -n Albums -m "<album><name>Abbey Road</name></album>"

```
# Improvements

* Adding dropdown menu for nodes subscriptions with the available
  nodes in the server
* Giving feedback to the user in the job configuration in case the
  configuration of the server is not filled or it is not possible to
  establish the connection.

## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in expandable textbox form control

**SECURITY-1498
/
CVE-2019-10401**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins form controls include an expandable textbox that can transform from a single-line text box to a multi-line text area.

The implementation of this transformation interpreted the text content of the form field as HTML.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of such `f:expandableTextbox` form controls.

Jenkins no longer interprets `f:expandableTextbox` text content as HTML when transforming it.

### XSS vulnerability in combobox form control

**SECURITY-1525
/
CVE-2019-10402**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins interpreted items added to `f:combobox` form controls as HTML.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of `f:combobox` form controls.

Jenkins no longer interprets items added to a combobox as HTML.

|  | This might be a breaking change for plugins that relied on the previous, undocumented behavior to add formatting to `f:combobox` elements. This has been removed without replacement. Plugin developers are advised to only add plain text entries to `f:combobox` controls. |
| --- | --- |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in SCM tag action tooltip

**SECURITY-1537 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10403**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown in the build history.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the SCM tag name for these actions.

Jenkins now escapes the SCM tag action.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in queue item tooltip

**SECURITY-1537 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10404**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not escape the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked, for example a label expression that does not match idle executors.

Jenkins now escapes the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.

### Diagnostic web page exposed Cookie HTTP header

**SECURITY-1505
/
CVE-2019-10405**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins shows various technical information about the current user on the `/whoAmI` URL.
The information shown includes HTTP request headers.

This allowed attackers able to exploit another cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the `Cookie` header’s value even if the `HttpOnly` flag would prevent direct access via JavaScript.

Jenkins no longer shows the value of the `Cookie` HTTP header on the `/whoAmI` URL.

### XSS vulnerability in Jenkins URL setting

**SECURITY-1471
/
CVE-2019-10406**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not validate or otherwise limit the possible values administrators could specify as Jenkins root URL.

This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Overall/Administer permission.

Jenkins now prevents values other than HTTP/HTTPS URLs from being set as Jenkins root URL.
Existing instances with invalid root URLs will behave as if no root URL was set.

|  | In case this results in problems, e.g. a valid URL unexpectedly being rejected, set the system property `jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.disableUrlValidation` to `true` to disable this restriction. [Learn more about system properties in Jenkins](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/). |

### Project Inheritance Plugin showed secret environment variables defined in Mask Passwords Plugin

**SECURITY-351
/
CVE-2019-10407**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Mask Passwords Plugin allows users to define secret environment variables (typically passwords) to be passed to builds, both globally, and for specific jobs.
These environment variables are expected to not be shown.

Project Inheritance Plugin showed the variable values on its *Full Build Flow* view and included them in the metadata download without masking.

Project Inheritance Plugin no longer shows variables contributed from Mask Password Plugin without masking.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Project Inheritance Plugin

**SECURITY-401
/
CVE-2019-10408 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10409 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Project Inheritance Plugin allows the creation of projects based on templates defined in the plugin configuration.

A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint triggering project creation allowed users with Overall/Read permission to create these projects.
Additionally, the HTTP endpoint did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The HTTP endpoint triggering project creation now requires Item/Create permission and submission of requests via POST.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Log Parser Plugin

**SECURITY-732
/
CVE-2019-10410**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`log-parser`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/log-parser)**

**Description:**

Log Parser Plugin did not escape an error message shown when log parsing patterns are invalid.
This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

Log Parser Plugin now escapes all variables displayed in its views.

### NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

SECURITY-1498 / CVE-2019-10401
Jenkins form controls include an expandable textbox that can transform
from a single-line text box to a multi-line text area.

The implementation of this transformation interpreted the text content of
the form field as HTML. This resulted in a cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of
such f:expandableTextbox form controls.

SECURITY-1525 / CVE-2019-10402
Jenkins interpreted items added to f:combobox form controls as HTML. This
resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers
able to control the contents of f:combobox form controls.

SECURITY-1537 (1) / CVE-2019-10403
Jenkins did not escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown
in the build history. This resulted in a cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the SCM tag name
for these actions.

SECURITY-1537 (2) / CVE-2019-10404
Jenkins did not escape the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked, for example
a label expression that does not match idle executors.

SECURITY-1505 / CVE-2019-10405
Jenkins shows various technical information about the current user on the
/whoAmI URL. The information shown includes HTTP request headers.

This allowed attackers able to exploit another cross-site scripting
vulnerability to obtain the Cookie header’s value even if the HttpOnly
flag would prevent direct access via JavaScript.

SECURITY-1471 / CVE-2019-10406
Jenkins did not validate or otherwise limit the possible values
administrators could specify as Jenkins root URL.

This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users
with Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-351 / CVE-2019-10407
Mask Passwords Plugin allows users to define secret environment variables
(typically passwords) to be passed to builds, both globally, and for
specific jobs. These environment variables are expected to not be shown.

Project Inheritance Plugin showed the variable values on its Full Build
Flow view and included them in the metadata download without masking.

SECURITY-401 / CVE-2019-10408 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10409 (permission check)
Project Inheritance Plugin allows the creation of projects based on
templates defined in the plugin configuration.

A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint triggering project
creation allowed users with Overall/Read permission to create these
projects. Additionally, the HTTP endpoint did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-732 / CVE-2019-10410
Log Parser Plugin did not escape an error message shown when log parsing
patterns are invalid. This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing
rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS
2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

SECURITY-1504 / CVE-2019-10430
NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin stored registry credentials
unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. These
credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1507 / CVE-2019-10427
Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stores a token credential in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the token is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
token through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and
similar situations.

SECURITY-1508 / CVE-2019-10428
Aqua Security Scanner Plugin stores a password in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1513 / CVE-2019-10411
Inedo BuildMaster Plugin Plugin stores a service password in its global
Jenkins configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1514 / CVE-2019-10412
Inedo ProGet Plugin Plugin stores a service password in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1557 / CVE-2019-10413
Data Theorem: CI/CD Plugin stored a proxy password unencrypted in job
config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This password could be viewed by
users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1574 / CVE-2019-10414
Git Changelog Plugin stored MediaWiki and Jira passwords unencrypted in job
config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These passwords could be viewed by
users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1575 / CVE-2019-10429
GitLab Logo Plugin stored a private token unencrypted in its global
