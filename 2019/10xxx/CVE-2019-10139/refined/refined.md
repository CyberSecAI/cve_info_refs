{
  "CVE-2019-10139": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "During the deployment of the Hosted Engine via cockpit-ovirt, the admin and appliance passwords were saved in plain text within an ansible variable file.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Passwords stored in plain text in a temporary file.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could access the plain text passwords before the file is deleted at the end of deployment. This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the system and virtual machines.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system running the cockpit-ovirt service.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker requires local access to the system and needs to be able to read files in `/var/lib/ovirt-hosted-engine-setup/cockpit/` before they are deleted."
