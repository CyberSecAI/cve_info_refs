As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (1) / CVE-2019-10471 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10472 (permission check)
Libvirt Slaves Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (2) / CVE-2019-10473
Libvirt Slaves Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1073 / CVE-2019-10474
Global Post Script Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
permission to list the files contained in $JENKINS_HOME/global-post-script
that can be used by the plugin.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1490 / CVE-2019-10475
build-metrics Plugin does not properly escape the label query parameter,
resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# build-metrics

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[Reflected XSS vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-10-23/#SECURITY-1490)**
* **[Stored XSS vulnerability](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-06-30/#SECURITY-1118)**
* **[Missing permission checks](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-06-30/#SECURITY-2643)**

* [Documentation](/build-metrics/)
* [Releases](/build-metrics/releases/)
* [Issues](/build-metrics/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/build-metrics/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/build-metrics/healthscore/)

This plugin uses the results from the [Global Build Stats
Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Global%2BBuild%2BStats%2BPlugin) to
generate some basic build metrics.  It is really useful in combination
with the [sidebar links
plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Sidebar-Link%2BPlugin).

## Requirements

This plugin requires Jenkins 1.509 or better and the [Global Build Stats
plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Global%2BBuild%2BStats%2BPlugin) 1.2
or better.

## Installation

To install the build metrics plugin, Go to "Manage Jenkins" -> "Plugin
Management". Check the latest version and install.  You will probably
need to restart the Jenkins server after that.

## How To Use the Plugin

### Manage Jenkins Screen

Go to "Manage Jenkins". You should see an icon of Jenkins with a little
data grid in front.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/build-metrics/docs/images/build-metrics.png)  Click
that and it will take you to the Built Metrics Search screen (see
below).

### Build Metrics Search Screen

The search screen is where you tell the plugin which jobs you wish to
report on and what timeframe should be included in the report.

﻿
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/build-metrics/docs/images/build-metrics-search.png)

Configure the following parameters:

* Search Results Label: set this to whatever text you wish to be
  displayed at the top of the search results screen. Usually this
  would be some descriptive text for the build job metrics being
  summarized.
* Select the time window: default is 2 weeks (must be an integer)
* Configure the filters (for more information on this, see the [Global
  Build Stats
  Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Global%2BBuild%2BStats%2BPlugin) configuration
  since this part of the UI was copied directly from it).

Click Search and the report will be generated and displayed (see Build
Metrics Report Screen below)

### Build Metrics Report Screen

The build metrics report screen is split into two sections. The top
section contains the selected jobs and their associated build metrics.
 The bottom section contains a list of failed builds; complete with the
job name, a link to the console output of the build, and a link to the
build itself as well as a section to display the 'cause' for the build
(see description of adding build failure cause below).

﻿
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/build-metrics/docs/images/build-metrics-results.png)

#### Adding a Cause for a build failure

I found it useful to have a description in the report for why the build
failed. This way I could see trends as they happened over time.  To add
a cause:

1. Click on the build number link in the failed build list (at the
   bottom of the build metrics report screen). This will take you to
   the home screen for the indicated build number.
2. Click the 'edit description' link (on the right hand side of the
   page).  Enter a description for the cause of the build failure and
   click the submit button.
3. Refresh the build metrics report screen and you will see the cause
   added to the build failure list.

## Intended Use Case

This plugin was created because the team I work on needed to deliver
some concise build metrics for our Jenkins builds on a rolling two week
iteration. These build metrics needed to have an overall failure rate
and an individual one per job, as well as a list of failed builds (with
associated causes).  This plugin provides that reporting mechanism.  To
be really useful though, we needed to be able to pull it up quickly and
easily every time we wanted to generate the report.  I use the [sidebar
links
plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Sidebar-Link%2BPlugin) to
accomplish this, by simply copying the url for the build metrics report
screen for a given set of search criteria.  I then enter this URL as a
sidebar link, using the icon that I created for the plugin and the
description (1st parameter on the search page) as the txt of the link.
 This way all of our users can just go to the main Jenkins dashboard and
pull up the report as needed.

We currently take the results of the report, copy them into an email and
send that to our development teams as a 'report card'.  A great
next-step for the use of this plugin would be to have a job that ran the
report and emailed out the contents on a scheduled basis.
