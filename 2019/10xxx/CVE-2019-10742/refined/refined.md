Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `axios` library's failure to properly terminate a data stream when the `maxContentLength` limit is exceeded. Even after the library detects that the content length exceeds the set limit and throws an error, the download stream continues, leading to the continued consumption of resources.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incomplete Input Validation:** The library checks `maxContentLength`, but doesn't terminate the stream when it's exceeded.
- **Resource Consumption:** Continuing to download and process data after an error condition leads to unnecessary resource usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by requesting a large file while setting a low `maxContentLength`. This forces the server to send data that the client will continue to download even after the limit is reached, consuming resources and potentially causing a denial of service.
- **High CPU/Memory Consumption:** The continued processing of data after the `maxContentLength` is exceeded leads to high CPU and memory consumption on the client side.
- **Application Unresponsiveness:**  The nodejs process could become unresponsive due to the resource exhaustion caused by handling the unnecessary data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network. An attacker can send a request to an application using a vulnerable version of `axios`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send an HTTP request to the server that uses a vulnerable version of `axios`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in `axios` versions prior to 0.18.1.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is provided in the content.
- The fix involves destroying the stream when `maxContentLength` is exceeded.
- The issue was tracked as GitHub issue #1098 and fixed by PR #1485, which was merged on May 7, 2019.
- Snyk initially provided a patch that had a bug (it placed the stream.destroy() call in the wrong location), which was corrected later.
- The vulnerability is remotely exploitable
