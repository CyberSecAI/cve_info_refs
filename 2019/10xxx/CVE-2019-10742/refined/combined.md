#### Introduced: 22 Sep 2017

[CVE-2019-10742  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10742) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-776  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/776.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `axios` to version 0.18.1 or higher.

## Overview

[axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) due to content continuing to be accepted from requests after `maxContentLength` is exceeded.

## PoC

```
require('axios').get(
  'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/A_Different_Slant_on_Carina.jpg',
  { maxContentLength: 2000 }
)
  .then(d => console.log('done'))
  .catch(e => console.log(e.toString()))

```
## Details

Denial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source libraries.

Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

* High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to process. For example, [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).
* Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](https://snyk.io/vuln/npm%3Aws%3A20171108)

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

5.3 medium

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is no loss of confidentiality within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Integrity (I)

  There is no loss of integrity within the impacted component.

  **None**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **Low**

## Description

![@nornagon](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/172800?v=4&size=48)[nornagon](https://github.com/nornagon)opened [on Sep 22, 2017](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1098#issue-259716605)

#### Summary

The following code demonstrates the issue:

```
require('axios').get(
  'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/A_Different_Slant_on_Carina.jpg',
  { maxContentLength: 2000 }
)
  .then(d => console.log('done'))
  .catch(e => console.log(e.toString()))
```

Expected behavior:

* The script exits immediately after printing "Error: maxContentLength size of 2000 exceeded"
* Not much more than 2KB was downloaded from the server

Actual behavior:

* The script prints "Error: maxContentLength size of 2000 exceeded", then continues to download the remaining 52MB of data from the server. It takes about two minutes before it exits on my connection.

It's possible to work around this by adding a cancellation token and manually canceling the request when an error is encountered. However, since the request never actually fires a "complete" event, it's surprising that the download continues, only to have the data be thrown into the void.

#### Context

* axios version: v0.16.2
* Environment: node v8.4.0, macOS Sierra 10.12.6

### @resure **[resure](/resure)** commented [Apr 15, 2018](#issue-314422826) • edited Loading

Currently, axios won't destroy download stream on exceeding maxContentLength, which in some cases can lead to high cpu usage and subsequent denial of service.

Here is how it looks (200 MB file, limit is 20 MB):

```
   ticks parent  name
  61777   81.0%  /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc-2.23.so
  61542   99.6%    LazyCompile: *Buffer.concat buffer.js:423:25
  61437   99.8%      Function: ~handleStreamData /home/resure/something/node_modules/axios/lib/adapters/http.js:165:52
  61437  100.0%        Function: ~emitOne events.js:114:17
  61437  100.0%          Function: ~emit events.js:156:44
  61437  100.0%            Function: ~addChunk _stream_readable.js:261:18

```

It almost hangs nodejs process for ~30 seconds, spending all that ticks on handling already rejected download.

This PR adds `stream.destroy()` (suggested in [#1098](https://github.com/axios/axios/issues/1098)), which is being called right before throwing an error about size limit.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Hello,  Please correct me if I am wrong, but it looks like all that is needed here is a one line change that was submitted via a PR more than a year ago. It also looks like all tests have passed on that PR.  I am very appreciative of the work that has gone into this project. I have quite a few projects of my own that depend on the awesome work contributed here. If there is additional work that needed to be done for this I would be happy and proud to pitch in.  Is there a way we can get this PR merged and released to close the security vulnerability? I would really like to continue to use this project, but I have a responsibility to ensure that the projects that I maintain are free from vulnerabilities.  Thank you for the continued efforts on this project and please let me know if there is something I can contribute to help close the vulnerability and add value to this project. |

| [@Luidog](https://github.com/Luidog) [@hughns](https://github.com/hughns) out of curiosity I looked into this, and it looks like there's something wrong with the patch from Snyk if you try to use it with axios 0.18.0. If you look in your `node_modules` (after allowing Snyk to apply the patch) the changes are not applied in the correct place since 0.18.0 differs from `master`:  ``` if (config.responseType === 'stream') {         response.data = stream;         settle(resolve, reject, response);       } else {         var responseBuffer = [];         stream.on('data', function handleStreamData(chunk) {           responseBuffer.push(chunk);            // make sure the content length is not over the maxContentLength if specified           if (config.maxContentLength > -1 && Buffer.concat(responseBuffer).length > config.maxContentLength) {             // stream.destroy() should have been added here             reject(createError('maxContentLength size of ' + config.maxContentLength + ' exceeded',               config, null, lastRequest));           }         });          stream.on('error', function handleStreamError(err) {           if (req.aborted) return;           reject(enhanceError(err, config, null, lastRequest));         });          stream.on('end', function handleStreamEnd() {           var responseData = Buffer.concat(responseBuffer);           if (config.responseType !== 'arraybuffer') {             responseData = responseData.toString('utf8');           }            response.data = responseData;           settle(resolve, reject, response);         });       }     });      // Handle errors     req.on('error', function handleRequestError(err) {       if (req.aborted) return;       reject(enhanceError(err, config, null, req));     });      // Handle request timeout     if (config.timeout && !timer) {       timer = setTimeout(function handleRequestTimeout() {         req.abort();         reject(createError('timeout of ' + config.timeout + 'ms exceeded', config, 'ECONNABORTED', req));       }, config.timeout);     }             stream.destroy();  // <-- incorrectly added here      if (config.cancelToken) {       // Handle cancellation       config.cancelToken.promise.then(function onCanceled(cancel) {         if (req.aborted) return;          req.abort();         reject(cancel);       });     } ```  So it seems like it's an issue with the Snyk patch, not axios itself. I sent a message to their support team to let them know |

| One more ping [@rajivshah3](https://github.com/rajivshah3) [@hughns](https://github.com/hughns) [@Luidog](https://github.com/Luidog) - not sure which one of you uses the Snyk patch but heads up that we've updated it a couple of hours ago and if you re-run `snyk protect` it should download the new version (or in any other issue you could re-apply the patch). |

| [@rajivshah3](https://github.com/rajivshah3) Well spotted! I should have added that this was via snyk (and that I have raised a ticket with snyk support too). We haven't tested with the 0.19.0-beta.1 release yet.  [@lirantal](https://github.com/lirantal) Yes, we saw the issue after the snyk patch was applied. The support ticket is <https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/requests/445> |

| [@lirantal](https://github.com/lirantal), I did indeed used the original snyk patch which caused the test failures. I have rerun the `snyk protect` and now the patch is applied correctly. Thank you for following up on this. |

| Apologies if it's veering offtopic for this thread, but is there a mechanism to tell the Snyk folks when an issue has been remediated in a new release? |

| [@schmod](https://github.com/schmod) you can always give us a ping through support@snyk.io or security@snyk.io. I'm happy to also take this offline with you through twitter (I'm at <https://www.twitter.com/liran_tal>) and be a source of contact or any other security related help I can provide |
