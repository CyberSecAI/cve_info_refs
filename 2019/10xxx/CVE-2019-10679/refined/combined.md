# Vulnerability Lab

With the **Vulnerability Lab**, SEC Consult **operates its own internal security laboratory**, in order to ensure an international know-how advantage over attackers in the areas of network and application security. In addition, this facility serves the support with high-quality penetration tests and with the evaluation of new technologies and is at the service of our customers. Thus, they receive the latest information about security gaps and valid statements about the risk profile of new technologies.

Our Vulnerability Lab follows a [Responsible Disclosure Policy](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/) which aims to provide vendors with the necessary information and timeframe needed to validate and fix a security flaw in order to mutually coordinate the public release of a security advisory as part of our responsible disclosure process. This document also clarifies the extent and limitation of effort the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab will invest. It can be found [here](/vulnerability-lab/responsible-disclosure-policy/).

Here you find all our **[studies and whitepapers](/vulnerability-lab/studies-and-whitepapers/)**.

You can reach our Vulnerability Lab through security-research(at)sec-consult.com. The PGP key with fingerprint F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F can be downloaded [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/vks/v1/by-fingerprint/F9A9D4AF3DC2D298835090252D2DD7B5C6EE883F).

The SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab is also an official [CNA](https://www.cve.org/PartnerInformation/ListofPartners/partner/SEC-VLab) (CVE Numbering Authority) and our scope for assigning CVE numbers is all vulnerabilities discovered in third-party hardware/software by the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab, which are not in another CNA's scope.

SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab Security Advisory < 20200826-0 >
=======================================================================
              title: Extensive file permissions on service executable
            product: Eikon Thomson Reuters
 vulnerable version: 4.0.42144
      fixed version: -
         CVE number: CVE-2019-10679
             impact: High
           homepage: eikon.thomsonreuters.com
              found: 2019-03-18

                     An integrated part of SEC Consult
                     Europe | Asia | North America

                     <https://www.sec-consult.com>

=======================================================================

Vendor description:
-------------------
"Eikon is the financial analysis desktop and mobile solution that connects you t
relevant, trusted content, Reuters news, markets, liquidity pools, and colleagues."

Source: <https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/spot-matching-forwards-matching>

Business recommendation:
------------------------
As long as the vendor did not release a patch for this vulnerability, we recommend
moving Eikon Thomson Reuters to a separate system outside the domain to which users
can connect to. Furthermore, we recommend to closely monitor any activities related
to Eikon Thomson Reuters.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
The current file permissions of the directory
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Thomson Reuters)\Eikon" allow users of the group
Authenticated Users to modify files in the folder. As these files are executed
by the service that runs with SYSTEM privileges, it is possible to escalate
privileges and create a new user with administrator privileges.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
The service's executable file is writeable by members of the Authenticated
Users group. A user can create a malicious file that for example creates a
new user and adds him to the Administrators group and replace the service's
executable file with it.

As the service runs in the SYSTEM users context, the malicious file will be
executed the next time the service is started. As the SYSTEM user has the
highest privileges, the mentioned actions are successfully performed and a new
user will be created and added to the administrators group.

Creating a new user represents only an example. Other critical actions can be
performed instead.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The following version has been tested which was the latest version available at
the time of discovery:
* 4.0.42144

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2019-04-09: Contacting vendor through the contact form in the homepage.
            Service request number is 07521820.
2019-04-09: Received reply that they will supply a security contact.
2019-04-16: Sent reminder as no security contact has been supplied yet.
2019-04-23: Sent reminder #2.
2019-04-23: Vendor replied: "Thank you for your reminder, the release
            date has been duly noted. As previously mentioned, I have
            transferred your query to our security specialists already,
            they will reach out to you if they deem it necessary."
2020-08-26: Release of security advisory.

Solution:
---------
As the vendor has not responded to any of our further requests, we are
currently unaware, whether a fix has been published or not. In any case,
we recommend to run the application on a separate server to which users
have to connect (e.g. via RDP).

Workaround:
-----------
We recommend enabling write permissions to administrative users only
and to adhere to updating best practices.

SEC Consult found a vulnerability that allows unprivileged users to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM in Eikon of Thomson Reuters. This is possible due to extensive file permissions that allow standard users to modify executable files.

## Vendor Description

*“Eikon is the financial analysis desktop and mobile solution that connects you t relevant, trusted content, Reuters news, markets, liquidity pools, and colleagues.”*

Source: <https://www.refinitiv.com/en/products/spot-matching-forwards-matching>

## Business Recommendation

As long as the vendor did not release a patch for this vulnerability, we recommend moving Eikon Thomson Reuters to a separate system outside the domain to which users can connect to. Furthermore, we recommend to closely monitor any activities related to Eikon Thomson Reuters.

## Vulnerability Overview / Description

The current file permissions of the directory ***C:\Program Files (x86)\Thomson Reuters)\Eikon*** allow users of the group Authenticated Users to modify files in the folder. As these files are executed by the service that runs with SYSTEM privileges, it is possible to escalate privileges and create a new user with administrator privileges.

## Proof Of Concept

The service’s executable file is writeable by members of the Authenticated Users group. A user can create a malicious file that for example creates a new user and adds him to the Administrators group and replace the service’s executable file with it.

As the service runs in the SYSTEM users context, the malicious file will be executed the next time the service is started. As the SYSTEM user has the highest privileges, the mentioned actions are successfully performed and a new user will be created and added to the administrators group.

Creating a new user represents only an example. Other critical actions can be performed instead.

## Vulnerable / Tested Versions

The following version has been tested which was the latest version available at the time of discovery:

* 4.0.42144
## Vendor Contact Timeline

| 2019-04-09 | Contacting vendor through the contact form in the homepage. Service request number is 07521820. |
| --- | --- |
| 2019-04-09 | Received reply that they will supply a security contact. |
| 2019-04-16 | Sent reminder as no security contact has been supplied yet. |
| 2019-04-23 | Sent reminder #2. |
| 2019-04-23 | Vendor replied: “Thank you for your reminder, the release date has been duly noted. As previously mentioned, I have transferred your query to our security specialists already, they will reach out to you if they deem it necessary.” |
| 2020-08-26 | Release of security advisory. |

## Solution

As the vendor has not responded to any of our further requests, we are currently unaware, whether a fix has been published or not. In any case, we recommend to run the application on a separate server to which users have to connect (e.g. via RDP).

## Workaround

We recommend enabling write permissions to administrative users only and to adhere to updating best practices.
