Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10368:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The JClouds Plugin did not perform proper permission checks on a method that implements form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to trigger connections to attacker-specified URLs with attacker-provided credential IDs.
*   The form validation method did not require POST requests, leading to a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The form validation method lacked a proper permission check, allowing unauthorized users with "Overall/Read" access to trigger actions that should be restricted to administrators.
*   **CSRF:** The form validation method did not require POST requests, making it susceptible to CSRF attacks. An attacker could trick a user into submitting a malicious request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Capture:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to capture credentials stored in Jenkins by connecting to a URL that they control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker would need to be a user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
*   They would craft a malicious request that leverages the vulnerable form validation method.
*   The lack of POST request requirement allows for CSRF attacks, possibly tricking other users into triggering the request.
*   The attacker can specify the URL and credentials ID used in the connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have at least Overall/Read access within the Jenkins instance.
*   They would need to be able to craft a URL that triggers the vulnerable validation method.
*   They would need an attacker-controlled server to capture the credentials.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the `jclouds-jenkins` plugin.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned two CVEs: CVE-2019-10368 for the CSRF issue and CVE-2019-10369 for the missing permission check.
*   The fix involves requiring POST requests for the vulnerable form validation method, and also requiring the user to have "Overall/Administer" permission.
*  The affected plugin version is up to and including 2.14, the fix is in version 2.15.
