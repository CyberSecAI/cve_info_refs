## Logs on the system

When running `jenkins.war` manually with `java -jar jenkins.war`, all logging information by default is output to standard out.
Many Jenkins native packages modify this behavior to ensure logging information is output in a more conventional location for the platform.

### Linux (rpm and deb)

By default logs can be viewed by running `journalctl -u jenkins.service`.

To customize the log location, run `systemctl edit jenkins` and add the following:

```
[Service]
Environment="JENKINS_LOG=%L/jenkins/jenkins.log"
```

### Windows (msi)

By default, logs should be at `%JENKINS_HOME%/jenkins.out` and `%JENKINS_HOME%/jenkins.err`, unless customized in `%JENKINS_HOME%/jenkins.xml`.

### macOS

Log files should be at `/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log`, unless customized in `org.jenkins-ci.plist`.

### War file

When Jenkins is started from a command line with `java -jar jenkins.war`, the log file will be written to the `JENKINS_HOME` directory.
If no value is assigned to the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable, the log file will be written to the `.jenkins/log` directory.

### Docker

If you run Jenkins inside Docker as a detached container, you can use `docker logs <containerId>` to view the Jenkins logs.

## Logs in Jenkins

Jenkins uses `java.util.logging` for logging.
The `java.util.logging` system by default sends every log above `INFO` to stdout.

Jenkins is equipped with a GUI for configuring/collecting/reporting log records of your choosing.
This page shows you how to do this.

First, select the "System Log" from the "Manage Jenkins" page:

![Manage Jenkins](../../resources/managing/SystemLog.png)

From there, you can create a custom log recorder, which helps you group relevant logs together while filtering out the noise.

![Log Recorders](../../resources/managing/Log-recorder.png)

Choose a name that makes sense to you.

![Enter log recorder name](../../resources/managing/Example-logger.png)

You’ll be then asked to configure loggers and their levels whose output you’d like to collect.
Depending on which part of Jenkins you monitor, you’ll need to specify different loggers.
Tell us the symptom of your problem in the users list and we should be able to tell you where you need to look.
Also, this is really just a wrapper around the java.util.logging package, so if you program in Java, you might be able to guess where to look.

![Specify loggers](../../resources/managing/Config-logger.png)

Once the set up is complete, Jenkins will start collecting data.
The collected logs are available from the web UI.

## Making custom logs available outside of the web UI

The simplest solution is to install the [Support Core Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/support-core), which causes custom logs to be written to disk automatically.

## Debug logging in Jenkins

1. Create a file `logging.properties`
2. Define the logging levels and a `ConsoleHandler`
3. Pass this file to the JVM by adding the system property `-Djava.util.logging.config.file=<pathTo>/logging.properties`.

An example **logging.properties** is included below.

|  | For a normal production environment the default level is INFO, it is not advised to have debug log in production. |
| --- | --- |

```
handlers = java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler

# see https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.logging/java/util/logging/SimpleFormatter.html
java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format = [%1$tF %1$tT][%4$-6s][%2$s] %5$s %6$s %n

# Keep this level to ALL or FINEST or it will be filtered before applying other levels
java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL

# Default level
.level= INFO

# High verbosity for a dedicated package com.myplugin.*
com.myplugin.level = ALL
```

## Descriptions

### Configuration as Code Plugin failed to mask secrets in system log messages

**SECURITY-1497
/
CVE-2019-10367**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.
Configuration as Code Plugin inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.
This was implemented in the [fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory](/security/advisory/2019-07-31/#SECURITY-1279).

That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator`.

Configuration as Code Plugin now uses the same secret detection for these log messages.

As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator` to a level that does not include these messages.
Configuration as Code Plugin 1.25 and earlier logs these messages at the `INFO` level, Configuration as Code Plugin 1.26 logs them at `FINE`.
See [the logging documentation](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) for details.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in JClouds Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1482
/
CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jclouds-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jclouds-jenkins)**

**Description:**

JClouds Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.

### Mask Passwords Plugin shows plain text passwords in global configuration form fields

**SECURITY-157
/
CVE-2019-10370**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mask-passwords`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mask-passwords)**

**Description:**

Mask Passwords Plugin allows specifying passwords to be provided to builds in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the passwords are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### HTTP session fixation vulnerability in GitLab Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-795
/
CVE-2019-10371**

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitLab Authentication Plugin does not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login.
This allows attackers able to control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Open redirect vulnerability in GitLab Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-796
/
CVE-2019-10372**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitLab Authentication Plugin records the HTTP `Referer` header when the authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL when the user has finished logging in.

This implements an open redirect, allowing malicious sites to implement a phishing attack, with users expecting they have just logged in to Jenkins.

SECURITY-1497 / CVE-2019-10367
Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins
system log. Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with
asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure. Configuration as
Code Plugin inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor
argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much
more robust for the purpose of log message masking. This was implemented in
the fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory.

That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the
logger io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator.

SECURITY-1482 / CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)
JClouds Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in
Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-157 / CVE-2019-10370
Mask Passwords Plugin allows specifying passwords to be provided to builds
in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the passwords are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure
of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-795 / CVE-2019-10371
Gitlab Authentication Plugin does not invalidate the previous session and
create a new one upon successful login. This allows attackers able to
control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

SECURITY-796 / CVE-2019-10372
Gitlab Authentication Plugin records the HTTP Referer header when the
authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL when the user
has finished logging in.

This implements an open redirect, allowing malicious sites to implement a
phishing attack, with users expecting they have just logged in to Jenkins.

SECURITY-879 / CVE-2019-10373
Build Pipeline Plugin does not properly escape variables in views,
resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
users with permission to configure build pipelines.

This vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins releases older than 2.146
or 2.138.2 due to the security hardening implemented in those releases.

SECURITY-142 / CVE-2019-10374
PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to implement support for
rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins. It advertises
disabling of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.

PegDown Formatter Plugin does not prevent the use of javascript: scheme in
URLs for links. This results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users
able to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are
rendered by the configured markup formatter.

SECURITY-569 / CVE-2019-10375
File System SCM Plugin allows users able to configure jobs to read
arbitrary files from the Jenkins master, even if the job is running on an
agent.

SECURITY-751 / CVE-2019-10376
Wall Display Master Project Plugin does not properly escape the customTheme
query parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-1099 / CVE-2019-10377
Avatar Plugin does not implement a permission check for the HTTP URL used
to replace user avatars. This allows any user with Overall/Read permission
to change any other user’s avatar, in addition to their own.

SECURITY-1428 / CVE-2019-10378
TestLink Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration
file hudson.plugins.testlink.TestLinkBuilder.xml on the Jenkins master.
These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the master file
system.

SECURITY-591 / CVE-2019-10379
Google Cloud Messsaging Notification Plugin stores an API key unencrypted
in its global configuration file org.jenkinsci.plugins.gcm.im.GcmPublisher.
xml on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-922 / CVE-2019-10380
Simple Travis Pipeline Runner Plugin defines a custom whitelist for scripts
protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass
Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code
execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

SECURITY-931 / CVE-2019-10381
Codefresh Integration Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate
validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1376 / CVE-2019-10382
VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS
certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1430 / CVE-2019-10385
eggPlant Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1008 / CVE-2019-10386 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10387 (permission check)
XL TestView Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1053 / CVE-2019-10388 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10389 (permission check)
A missing permission check in a form validation method in Relution
Enterprise Appstore Publisher Plugin allows users with Overall/Read
permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL using
attacker-specified credentials and attacker-specified HTTP proxy
configuration.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
