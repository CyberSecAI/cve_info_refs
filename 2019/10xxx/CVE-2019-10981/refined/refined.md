Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-10981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficiently protected credentials. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the software stores user credentials, making them accessible to a local, authenticated user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-522:** Insufficiently Protected Credentials. This means the software does not properly protect sensitive data like user credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful exploit allows a local attacker to gain access to Citect user credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Local access is required. The attacker needs to have already gained some level of authenticated access on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must be a local, authenticated user on the system running the vulnerable software.
*   The attacker does not need high skills to exploit the vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
*   Vijeo Citect 7.30 and 7.40
*   CitectSCADA 7.30 and 7.40

**Mitigations:**
*   Upgrade to CitectSCADA 2018.
*   Implement least privilege principles throughout the system.
*   Organizations should perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment before deploying defensive measures.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

The information from the ICS-CERT advisory provides significantly more detail than the basic CVE description (which is just a placeholder). It clarifies the specific software versions affected, the nature of the vulnerability (CWE-522), the attack vector (local access), and the recommended mitigations.
