Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10103:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the run configuration of certain application servers within JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA, allowing remote code execution while running the server with default settings.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary code remotely on a system running the vulnerable IntelliJ IDEA configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the affected system by an attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by targeting the server instance through network connections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the targeted server running the vulnerable IntelliJ IDEA configuration.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited when the server is running with default configurations, which doesn't seem to require prior authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The JetBrains Security Bulletin indicates that CVE-2019-10103 is related to remote code execution through the run configurations of certain application servers.
- The NetApp advisory lists this CVE as part of a set of vulnerabilities related to JetBrains Kotlin versions prior to 1.3.30. However, the root cause as described is different. It seems that the NetApp products include vulnerable versions of the JetBrains libraries that in turn have their own vulnerabilities. This CVE is not related to vulnerable Kotlin code but to remote code execution.
- NetApp lists no affected products for this CVE, which indicates that the risk is related to a vulnerable component in the products.
- The vulnerability is categorized as "High" severity by both NetApp and JetBrains, indicating its critical nature.
