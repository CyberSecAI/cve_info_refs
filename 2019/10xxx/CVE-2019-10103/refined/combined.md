# JetBrains Security Bulletin Q1 2019

![Robert Demmer](https://blog.jetbrains.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/robert-200x200.png)

[Robert Demmer](https://blog.jetbrains.com/author/robert-demmer)

This bulletin summarizes the security vulnerabilities detected in JetBrains products and remediated in the first quarter of 2019.

These include issues [reported by Jonathan Leitschuh](https://medium.com/%40jonathan.leitschuh/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb) potentially exposing a product user or a project’s infrastructure to man-in-the-middle attacks, namely

* resolving Gradle, Maven, and sbt project artifacts over an unencrypted connection in various projects; and
* generating project templates in an IDE causing the above-mentioned issue in a user’s project.

We’ve also run extended verification of the secret storage mechanism in our IDEs’ settings, and identified and fixed several cases of cleartext secret storage.

Here’s a summary report that comprises the affected product, the description of each issue, its severity, and the product version containing the fix.
