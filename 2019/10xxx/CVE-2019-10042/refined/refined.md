### D-Link DIR-816 A2 Reset Router Without Authentication

The provided content describes a vulnerability in the D-Link DIR-816 A2 router that allows an attacker to reset the router to its default settings without requiring authentication.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The router exposes an API endpoint `/goform/LoadDefaultSettings` that can be accessed without authentication.
*   **Vulnerability**: Missing authentication for the `/goform/LoadDefaultSettings` API endpoint.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can reset the router to its default settings, potentially disrupting network services and gaining unauthorized access to the device.
*   **Attack vector**: By sending a POST request to the `/goform/LoadDefaultSettings` endpoint. The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) shows how to obtain a token ID and use it in the request to trigger the reset.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have the ability to send HTTP requests to the router's IP address.
