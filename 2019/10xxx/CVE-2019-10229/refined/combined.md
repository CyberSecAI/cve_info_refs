MAILSTORE-SA-2019-01: Improper Authentication in Generic LDAP Directory Service Synchronization
Affected Products
MailStore Server 9.6 to 11.2.1
MailStore Service Provider Edition 9.6 to 11.2.1
References
CVE-2019-10229: http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10229
CWE-287: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/287.html
Summary:
The LDAP connector in the affected products does not re-authenticate subsequent
login attempts attempts of existing users, as an LDAP connection of the failed
initial login attempt to a remote LDAP sever exists in the connection pool and
has not been invalidated by the failed login attempt.
Effect:
To exploit a vulnerable MailStore Server or MailStore Service Provider Edition
Instance, it must be configured to authenticate users by using "Generic LDAP"
as directory service.
If that configuration is used and the authentication attribute of a MailStore
user is set to "Directory Service" (either manually or through directory service
synchronization), an attacker may login as that user if the username is known
to him, by retrying to login after the first failed attempt using the same password.
Attack type:
Remote
Attack vector(s):
\* Directory Service configuration must be set to "Generic LDAP"
\* Users must be set to authenticate against "Directory Service"
\* Existing user must be known to attacker
Solution:
Update to Version 11.2.2 or higher
