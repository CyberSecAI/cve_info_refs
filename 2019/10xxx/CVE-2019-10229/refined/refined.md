### CVE-2019-10229
Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability based on the provided text:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper authentication in the "Generic LDAP" directory service synchronization within MailStore Server and MailStore Service Provider Edition. The LDAP connector does not re-authenticate subsequent login attempts of existing users. A failed initial login attempt leaves an existing LDAP connection in the connection pool (not invalidated), which is then reused.
*   **Weakness:** CWE-287 Improper Authentication
*   **Impact:** An attacker, knowing a valid username, can gain unauthorized access by retrying a login attempt with the same (incorrect) password after an initial failed attempt.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The MailStore Server/Service Provider Edition must be configured to authenticate users using "Generic LDAP".
    *   The user's authentication attribute must be set to "Directory Service".
    *   The attacker must know a valid username.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to know a valid username and be able to make login attempts against the MailStore Server/Service Provider Edition instance.
