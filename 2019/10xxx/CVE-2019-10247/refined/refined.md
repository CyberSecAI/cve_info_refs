**Content from:** `www.debian.org_b1db1b6f_20250121_001457.html`

This document is a Debian Security Advisory (DSA 4949-1) related to a security update for the `jetty9` package. It mentions that `jetty9` is affected by `CVE-2019-10241, CVE-2019-10247, CVE-2020-27216, CVE-2020-27223, CVE-2020-28165, CVE-2020-28169, CVE-2021-34428`, and the fix is available in version `9.4.16-0+deb10u1`.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The advisory mentions multiple vulnerabilities in Jetty, specifically that `CVE-2019-10247` could lead to information disclosure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure Vulnerability.  Specifically, the advisory indicates that: *The server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will reveal the configured fully qualified directory base resource location on the output of the 404 error for not finding a Context that matches the requested path. The default server behavior on jetty-distribution and jetty-home will include at the end of the Handler tree a DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting this 404 error, it presents the various configured contexts as HTML for users to click through to. This produced HTML includes output that contains the configured fully qualified directory base resource location for each context.*
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Information Disclosure Vulnerability that could reveal the server's resource path.
*   **Attack vectors:** The advisory mentions that the default server behavior on Jetty will include at the end of the handler tree a DefaultHandler, which is responsible for reporting a 404 error and revealing the server's resource path. Therefore, sending a request that returns a 404 error can trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a request to the server.

**Content from:** `bugs.eclipse.org_261b6276_20250121_001454.html`

This is a bug report in the Eclipse Bugzilla that is titled, "**Bug 546577 (CVE-2019-10247) - Jetty CVE Request: Information Reveal - DefaultHandler**".  The provided bug report describes the vulnerability as: *The server running on any OS and Jetty version combination will reveal the configured fully qualified directory base resource location on the output of the 404 error for not finding a Context that matches the requested path.*, and lists the vulnerable and resolved Jetty versions, corresponding to the text of the Debian advisory.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The server's DefaultHandler exposes the full path to the resource base directory when a 404 error is triggered by a request to an invalid context.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure. A misconfigured Jetty server reveals the full file system path of its resources in 404 errors
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can discover the server's internal file structure through a 404 error output.
*   **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending an invalid request that produces a 404 error.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can access the server and generate a request.

This document from NetApp lists `CVE-2019-10241, CVE-2019-10246, and CVE-2019-10247` as related vulnerabilities in multiple NetApp products that incorporate Eclipse Jetty server. It states that successfully exploiting these vulnerabilities could lead to a disclosure of sensitive information or addition/modification of data.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NetApp document identifies the vulnerability as being present in Eclipse Jetty, which when successfully exploited can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information Disclosure Vulnerability that could lead to modification or data addition.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could disclose sensitive information or modify or add data.
*   **Attack vectors:** Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Remote

**Summary of Extracted Information**

Based on the analyzed content, the following details about `CVE-2019-10247` can be summarized:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability occurs in the `DefaultHandler` component of Eclipse Jetty. When a request for an invalid context is made, a 404 error is generated, but the server also reveals the file system path for the resource base in the 404 HTML response.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure. The server's fully qualified directory base resource location is exposed in a 404 error response. This exposure also impacts versions 7.x, 8.x, 9.2.27.v20190403 and older, 9.3.26.v20190403 and older, 9.4.16.v20190411 and older and were resolved in versions  9.2.28.v20190418, 9.3.27.v20190418, and 9.4.17.v20190418.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can obtain sensitive information about the server's file structure.
*   **Attack vectors:** A remote attacker can send a request to an invalid context, triggering a 404 error that reveals the file system path in the HTML response.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker, without any privilege or specific user interaction, can send malicious web request to trigger the vulnerability and obtain the server's file system path.

**Conclusion**

The content provides details about the root cause, the type of vulnerability (information disclosure), its impact, attack vectors and attacker capabilities for `CVE-2019-10247`.
