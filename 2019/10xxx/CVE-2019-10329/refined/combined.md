## Description

Collects data from various other Jenkins plugins and sends metrics to InfluxDB. It's also possible to send custom data inside pipeline jobs.

## Breaking Changes

Support for InfluxDB 1.7 and lower was dropped in plugin release 3.0.

You can find all breaking changes for each version in the [breaking changes documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin/blob/development/doc/breaking_changes.md).

## Configuration

### Configuration as Code

To configure InfluxDB plugin in Jenkins add the following to `jenkins.yaml`:

```
unclassified:
  influxDbGlobalConfig:
    targets:
    - credentialsId: "some_id"
      database: "some_database"
      description: "some description"
      exposeExceptions: true
      globalListener: true
      globalListenerFilter: "some filter"
      jobScheduledTimeAsPointsTimestamp: true
      retentionPolicy: "some_policy"
      url: "http://some/url"
      usingJenkinsProxy: true
```
> ⚠️
>  Prior 3.0, `credentialsId` needs to swapped to `username` and `password`.

### Via Jenkins UI

Create a database in InfluxDB and a user with access rights. In Jenkins, go to *Manage Jenkins > Configure System > InfluxDB Targets* and click "Add". Provide the database information. The "URL" parameter requires the whole URL of the InfluxDB database, including the `http(s)://` and the database port. Also, provide the retention policy you want the data to be stored in InfluxDB (e.g. `15m` or `2d`). By default, it is `infinite`. Exceptions generated by the InfluxDB plugin can also be ignored by deselecting the "Expose Exceptions" checkbox.

> ⚠️
>  When you are using InfluxDB 1.x targets, **leave the Organization blank**. InfluxDB 2.x uses organizations and buckets instead of databases and retention policies, so `organization` field is used as an identifier whether the target is InfluxDB 1.x or 2.x.

[![Jenkins Configuration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin@development/doc/img/jenkins-configuration.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin/blob/development/doc/img/jenkins-configuration.png)

In your job, select "Publish build data to InfluxDB" from the post-build actions.

[![Post build menu](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin@development/doc/img/post-build-action.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin/blob/development/doc/img/post-build-action.png)

### Via Jenkins Pipeline

From version 1.19 onwards, you can create and remove targets in pipelines directly.

```
// Get InfluxDB plugin descriptor (version < 2.0)
def influxdb = Jenkins.instance.getDescriptorByType(jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.DescriptorImpl)

// version >= 2.0
def influxdb = Jenkins.instance.getDescriptorByType(jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.InfluxDbStep.DescriptorImpl)

// Create target
def target = new jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.models.Target()

// Set target details

// Mandatory fields
target.description = 'my-new-target'
target.url = 'http://influxdburl:8086'

// Not supported >= 3.0
target.username = 'my-username'

// version < 2.0
target.password = 'my-password'

// version 2.0 to 2.6
target.password = hudson.util.Secret.fromString('my-password')

// Version >= 3.0
target.credentialsId = 'my-id'

target.database = 'my-database'

// Optional fields
target.retentionPolicy = '1d'                    // default = 'autogen'
target.jobScheduledTimeAsPointsTimestamp = true  // default = false
target.exposeExceptions = true                   // default = true
target.usingJenkinsProxy = true                  // default = false

// Add a target by using the created target object
influxdb.addTarget(target)
influxdb.save()

// Write stuff to InfluxDB
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-new-target')

// Remove a target by using the target description field value
influxdb.removeTarget('my-new-target')
influxdb.save()

```

### Credentials

* InfluxDB 1.8 targets support only `Username with password`.
* InfluxDB 2.x supports `Username with password` for basic authentication and `Secret Text` for authentication token authentication.

## Usage

### Global Listener

When `globalListener` is set to `true` for a target in which no results were published during the build, it will automatically publish the result for this target when the build is completed.

To configure the global listener, you can use environment variables prefixed with `INFLUXDB_PLUGIN`. The following variables are supported and all correspond to an `influxDbPublisher` optional parameter.

* `INFLUXDB_PLUGIN_CUSTOM_PROJECT_NAME` -> `customProjectName`
* `INFLUXDB_PLUGIN_CUSTOM_PREFIX` -> `customPrefix`
* `INFLUXDB_PLUGIN_CUSTOM_FIELDS` -> `jenkinsEnvParameterField`
* `INFLUXDB_PLUGIN_CUSTOM_TAGS` -> `jenkinsEnvParameterTag`

***NOTE:*** The environment variables must be set on the final build object. If you are creating or updating these variables in a pipeline, you should make sure they are exported with an [EnvironmentContributingAction](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/hudson/model/EnvironmentContributingAction.html).

### Freestyle Jobs

Select the InfluxDB target you wish to publish the data to.

[![Select Target](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin@development/doc/img/select-influxdb-target.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin/blob/development/doc/img/select-influxdb-target.png)

From the "Advanced" tab you can choose to set a custom prefix for your `project_name` field, a custom project name to be used instead of the default job name, custom fields for your `jenkins_data` metric, and custom tags for your all your metrics.

[![Advanced Options](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin@development/doc/img/advanced-options.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin/blob/development/doc/img/advanced-options.png)

### Pipelines

The plugin can be used by calling either the `influxDbPublisher()` or the `step()` function.

***NOTE:*** The `influxDbPublisher()` function is only supported from version 1.21 onwards.

**Pipeline syntax**

The only mandatory parameter is `selectedTarget`, which is the "Description" for your target in the global configuration.

```
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target')

```

```
step([$class: 'InfluxDbPublisher', selectedTarget: 'my-target'])

```

Optional parameters

* `customProjectName` (String) - custom project name
* `customPrefix` (String) - custom prefix for project name
* `customData` (Map) - custom fields in "jenkins\_custom\_data" measurement
* `customDataTags` (Map) - custom tags in "jenkins\_custom\_data" measurement
* `customDataMap` (Map) - custom fields in custom measurements
* `customDataMapTags` (Map) - custom tags in custom measurements (map of tags for each custom measurements)
* `jenkinsEnvParameterField` (String) - custom fields in "jenkins\_data" measurement (newline-separated KEY=VALUE pairs)
* `jenkinsEnvParameterTag` (String) - custom tags in all measurements (newline-separated KEY=VALUE pairs)
* `measurementName` (String) - custom measurement name (replaces default "jenkins\_data" and "jenkins\_custom\_data")

All `customData*` parameters contain custom data generated during the build and not by the plugin, so they are not available in the snippet generator.

> ❗ NOTE! Up to release 1.10.3, pipeline was configured with using the url and database.
>
> ```
> step([$class: 'InfluxDbPublisher',
>        target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8086,jenkins_db',
>        ...
>    ])
>
> ```
>
> This form of configuration is not supported from version 1.11 onwards.

Pipelines don't have post-build actions, so the build result, build ordinal, and the build success boolean will default to `"?"`, `5`, and `false` respectively, unless set manually before calling `InfluxDbPublisher`. Only the build result needs to be set manually, as the boolean value and ordinal are set based on build result. Also, the build status will appear as `"?"` and the build duration might be a little off, because the build is not actually finished. If you want to get those pieces of information you need to configure the plugin separately on each job as a post-build action. The jobs can be run with, for example, the [Build Pipeline Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build%2BPipeline%2BPlugin) to get data from all jobs to InfluxDB. Alternatively, you can insert the information in your build manually inside your Groovy script.

```
try {
    // Build things here
    if (currentBuild.result == null) {
        currentBuild.result = 'SUCCESS' // sets the ordinal as 0 and boolean to true
    }
} catch (err) {
    if (currentBuild.result == null) {
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE' // sets the ordinal as 4 and boolean to false
    }
    throw err
} finally {
    influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target')
}

```

## Custom Data

You can write custom data to InfluxDB like this:

```
def myFields = [:]
myFields['field_a'] = 11
myFields['field_b'] = 12
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target', customData: myFields)

```

This adds the fields `field_a` and `field_b` with values `11` and `12` respectively to a measurement called `jenkins_custom_data`.

You can also add tags to this measurement with the `customDataTags` parameter.

Alternatively, you can write custom data to InfluxDB with a higher degree of customization like this:

```
def myFields1 = [:]
def myFields2 = [:]
def myCustomMeasurementFields = [:]
myFields1['field_a'] = 11
myFields1['field_b'] = 12
myFields2['field_c'] = 21
myFields2['field_d'] = 22
myCustomMeasurementFields['series_1'] = myFields1
myCustomMeasurementFields['series_2'] = myFields2
myTags = ['series_1':['tag_a':'a','tag_b':'b'],'series_2':['tag_c':'c','tag_d':'d']]
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target', customDataMap: myCustomMeasurementFields, customDataMapTags: myTags)

```

This creates 2 measurements, `series_1` and `series_2`. It adds the fields `field_a` and `field_b` with values `11` and `12` respectively to measurement `series_1`. It adds the fields `field_c` and `field_d` with values `21` and `22` respectively to measurement `series_2`.

You can also add tags to your custom measurements with the `customDataMapTags` parameter. You **must** use the same map keys as measurement names as in `customDataMap`.

## Supported Metrics

See all available metrics from the [available metrics documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/influxdb-plugin/blob/development/doc/available_metrics.md).

## Contribution

<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1373 / CVE-2019-10325
Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings
parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included
HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings
parser names.

SECURITY-1391 / CVE-2019-10326
Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross-
site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning
counts for future builds.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent
via POST.

SECURITY-1409 / CVE-2019-10327
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a
way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary
directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have
Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities
for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request
forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External
Entities in XML documents.

SECURITY-921 / CVE-2019-10328
Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as
Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary
methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.

SECURITY-1403 / CVE-2019-10329
InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

SECURITY-1046 / CVE-2019-10330
Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to
the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not
be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit
access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to
Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the
configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull
request content when those are trusted.

SECURITY-1015 (1) / CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (permission check)
Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1015 (2) / CVE-2019-10323
Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1347 / CVE-2019-10324
Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to
trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

**Affected plugin:
[`gitea`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitea)**

**Description:**

Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior.
Attackers without commit access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull request content when those are trusted.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Artifactory Plugin allow capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1015 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1015 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10323**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### CSRF vulnerability in Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1347
/
CVE-2019-10324**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.
