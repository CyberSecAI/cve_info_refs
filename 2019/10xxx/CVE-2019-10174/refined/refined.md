{
  "CVE-2019-10174": {
    "description": "The `invokeAccessibly` method in the `ReflectionUtil` class within Infinispan allows any application class to invoke private methods in any class with Infinispan's privileges. The attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the application.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `invokeAccessibly` method in the `ReflectionUtil` class within Infinispan, which permits invocation of private methods in any class using Infinispan's elevated privileges.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure use of reflection",
      "Access control bypass",
      "Privilege escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can use reflection to introduce new, malicious behavior into the application, potentially leading to disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, or denial-of-service (DoS).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to invoke the vulnerable `invokeAccessibly` method through application logic.",
        "Knowledge of the vulnerable code and the targeted private method to execute."
    ]
