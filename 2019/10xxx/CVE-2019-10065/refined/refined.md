Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from how OTRS handles search results and access controls for internal FAQ articles.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The primary weakness is that customer users, who should not have access to internal content, are able to view information from internal FAQ articles through search result screens. This indicates a failure in access control enforcement during search result presentation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Information Disclosure: A customer user can potentially gain access to sensitive internal information contained within the FAQ articles. This could reveal confidential processes, internal procedures, or other private data that should not be exposed to customers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Search Functionality: The attacker exploits the search functionality of the OTRS system to uncover internal FAQ articles. The search function itself might not be flawed, but the display of the search results is not adequately restricted.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Customer User: The attacker needs to be a registered and authenticated customer user of the OTRS system. They do not need any elevated privileges; a standard customer account is sufficient to carry out the attack.
- User Interaction: The attack requires the user to initiate searches through the OTRS interface.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is identified as low severity with a CVSS v3 score of 3.1.
- It affects OTRS versions 7.0.x up to and including 7.0.6.
- The vulnerability is fixed in OTRS version 7.0.7 and later, which is the recommended upgrade path.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Laszlo Gyaraki.
- The vulnerability is present in the OTRS framework itself, not a specific module.
