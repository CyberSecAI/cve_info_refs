# Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-10-01

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [DingTalk
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dingding-notifications)
* [HTML Publisher
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher)
* [LDAP Email
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ldapemail)
* [Script Security
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)
* [SourceGear Vault
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vault-scm-plugin)

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1579
/
CVE-2019-10431**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through default parameter expressions in constructors.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in HTML Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1590
/
CVE-2019-10432**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`htmlpublisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher)**

**Description:**

HTML Publisher Plugin did not escape the project or build display name shown in the frame HTML page.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the project or build display name, typically users with Job/Configure or Build/Update permission.

HTML Publisher Plugin now escapes the display name displayed in the frame HTML page.

### DingTalk Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1423
/
CVE-2019-10433**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dingding-notifications`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dingding-notifications)**

**Description:**

DingTalk Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This token can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### LDAP Email Plugin shows plain text password in configuration form

**SECURITY-1515
/
CVE-2019-10434**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ldapemail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ldapemail)**

**Description:**

LDAP Email Plugin stores an LDAP bind password in its global Jenkins configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### SourceGear Vault Plugin shows plain text password in configuration form

**SECURITY-1524
/
CVE-2019-10435**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`vault-scm-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vault-scm-plugin)**

**Description:**

SourceGear Vault Plugin stores an SCM password in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
