* [Azure PublisherSettings Credentials
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-publishersettings-credentials)
* [GitLab
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin)
* [jira-ext
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira-ext)

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitLab Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1357
/
CVE-2019-10300 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10301 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin)**

**Description:**

GitLab Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### jira-ext Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-836
/
CVE-2019-10302**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jira-ext`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira-ext)**

**Description:**

jira-ext Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.jira.JiraProjectProperty.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

jira-ext Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-844
/
CVE-2019-10303**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-publishersettings-credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-publishersettings-credentials)**

**Description:**

Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored the service management certificate unencrypted in `credentials.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin has been deprecated.
Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin 1.5 no longer provides any user features and we recommend the plugin be uninstalled.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin

**SECURITY-983
/
CVE-2019-10304 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10305 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`deployit-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a form validation method in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

### Sandbox bypass in ontrack Jenkins Plugin

**SECURITY-1341
/
CVE-2019-10306**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`ontrack`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ontrack)**

**Description:**

ontrack Jenkins Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions.
Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

This allowed users able to control the pluginâs job-specific configuration to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

ontrack Jenkins Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.

## Severity

* SECURITY-844:

A plugin for Jenkins CI to update JIRA tickets in an extensible way: both what to update and how to update are exposed as `ExtensionPoint`s.

Out of the box, you may discover issues by:

* The issue key as the first word of the commit message
* The issue key as the first word of the upstream commit message
* Manually specifying an issue
* Looking for it being mentioned somewhere in the commit message

To all of these JIRA issues, you may:

* Add a comment
* Update a field
* Add a label
* Transition a ticket (`Start Work`, `Resolve`, etc..)

Example UI:

[![jira-ext-1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731899/12099841/5d1671e8-b2e8-11e5-9c6d-d28073ad7c15.png)](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/731899/12099841/5d1671e8-b2e8-11e5-9c6d-d28073ad7c15.png)

# Comparison to jira-plugin

The jira-ext plugin is meant to be extensible in ways that the jira-plugin is not. Both Jenkins and JIRA are used as part of an organizations workflow, and as such are highly customizable. The jira-ext plugin continues this philosophy by making the actions (and when to perform those actions) also customizable for your organization.

In terms of specific features:

jira-ext plugin:

1. Specify issues manually
2. Specify issues from upstream commits
3. Transitions issues
4. Add label to issues
5. Update custom fields
6. Customize comments on issues

jira-plugin:

1. Perform release notes
2. (Deprecated) support for SOAP
3. Specify issues from JQL
4. Automatically link back to jenkins builds (backpointers)
5. Link JIRA issues in the Jenkins UI

# Extending the plugin

The jira-ext plugin is built with extension in mind. Both how to discover issues and what action to take are customizable. They are implemented as ExtensionPoint, meaning your plugin (or a custom plugin) can contribute its own ticket discovery strategies or operations based on logic specific to your installation or environment.

For example, a code review build could provide a link to the code review server in the JIRA issue as a custom field, or as a comment.

Or another example, a production release build could update tickets based on differences between tags, to keep track of what was deployed last.

If you want to add an operation which should be part of any JIRA install, please open a pull request.

## Add a custom `Discover Issues By` option

You may update what tickets to update using an `IssueStrategyExtension` and `IssueStrategyExtensionDescriptor`. See `SingleTicketStrategy` for an example.

## Add a custom JIRA operation

You may add your own operations using a `JiraOperationExtension` and `JiraOperationExtensionDescriptor`. See `AddComment` for an example.

## The jira-ext plugin can be configured via job-dsl plugin:

```
job {
  //...
  steps {
    //...
    updateJiraExt {
        issueStrategy {
            singleIssue('JENKINS-101')
            // - or -
            firstWordOfCommit()
            // - or -
            firstWordOfUpstreamCommit()
            // - or -
            mentionedInCommit()
        }

        jiraOperations {
            transition('Deploy to Test');
            addComment('You went through a Jenkins build!', true)
            addLabel('Cool stuff')
            updateField('customField_123', 'Hello World')
        }
    }
    //...
  }
}

```
