## Analysis of CVE-2019-10457

The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin for Jenkins.

**Vulnerability:** Missing permission checks and CSRF

*   **Root Cause:** The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission checks, CSRF vulnerability
*   **Attack Vector:** A user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password. This is possible because the plugin lacks permission checks on its form validation method. The form validation method not requiring POST requests enables CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can potentially capture the username and password provided by the user during the connection test.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to lure a user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to trigger the connection test.

**Affected Plugin:**

*   `oracle-cloud-infrastructure-compute-classic` up to and including 1.0.0

**Status:**

*   As of the publication of the advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
