SECURITY-1583 / CVE-2019-10436
Google OAuth Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of credentials based
on the content of files on the Jenkins master through a feature retaining
backwards compatibility with earlier plugin releases.

This allowed users with the permission to configure jobs and credentials to
read arbitrary files on the Jenkins master by creating a credential
referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins master.

SECURITY-1006 (1) / CVE-2019-10437 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10438 (permission check)
CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin did not perform permission checks on a
method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1006 (2) / CVE-2019-10439
CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin provides a list of applicable
credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to
use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1427 / CVE-2019-10440
NeoLoad Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration
file org.jenkinsci.plugins.neoload.integration.NeoGlobalConfig.xml and in
job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file
system.

SECURITY-1484 / CVE-2019-10441 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10442 (permission check)
iceScrum Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-
specified access token or username and password.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1436 / CVE-2019-10443
iceScrum Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1481 / CVE-2019-10444
Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate
validation for connections to the HP ALM service.

SECURITY-1607 / CVE-2019-10445
Missing permission checks in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin allowed users
with Overall/Read permission to obtain limited information about the scope
and access of a credential with an attacker-specified credential ID
obtained through another method.

SECURITY-1615 / CVE-2019-10446
Cadence vManager Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate
validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-918 / CVE-2019-10458
Puppet Enterprise Pipeline Plugin defines a custom whitelist for all
scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass
Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code
execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.

SECURITY-1431 / CVE-2019-10447
