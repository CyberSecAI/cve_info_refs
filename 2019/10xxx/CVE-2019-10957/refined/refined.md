The provided content is related to CVE-2019-10957.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper neutralization of input during web page generation, which leads to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when generating web pages. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability allows a remote authenticated attacker with access to event configuration to store malicious code on the server. This malicious code can be triggered by a legitimate user, leading to code execution within the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote:** The attacker can be located remotely.
*   **Network:** The attack occurs over the network via web requests.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated.
*   **User Interaction Required:** A legitimate user must interact with the injected malicious code for the XSS to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have an account with high privileges that allows access to event configuration.
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application to send malicious requests.
