{
  "CVE-2019-10156": {
    "Description": "A flaw was discovered in the way Ansible templating was implemented, causing the possibility of information disclosure through unexpected variable substitution. By taking advantage of unintended variable substitution the content of any variable may be disclosed.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the improper handling of variable substitution during Ansible templating.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper variable substitution in templating"
      ],
    "Impact": "Information disclosure allowing an attacker to potentially access sensitive information by revealing variable contents.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can craft malicious templates that exploit unintended variable substitution to reveal the content of other variables.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to control or influence the content of Ansible templates or have access to inject malicious templates where Ansible processes them."
