CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin

*   **Vulnerability**: CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check
*   **Root cause**: The plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation and the form validation method did not require POST requests.
*   **Weakness**: Missing permission checks, CSRF.
*   **Attack vector**: Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.
*   **Impact**: Capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Required capabilities**: Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
