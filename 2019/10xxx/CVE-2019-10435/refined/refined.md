Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10435:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The SourceGear Vault Plugin stores an SCM password in job configurations. While the password is encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission:** The primary vulnerability is the transmission of the password in plain text when the configuration form is loaded or submitted. This exposes the password during the configuration process.
*   **Storage of Credentials:** The plugin stores SCM credentials. This itself is not a vulnerability, but it creates a target.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Exposure:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the SCM password, allowing them to access the associated source code repository and potentially other systems.
*   **Lateral Movement:** Exposed SCM credentials could be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Browser Extensions:** Malicious browser extensions could intercept the plain text password as it is transmitted.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If an XSS vulnerability existed elsewhere in the application, an attacker could use that to steal the credentials as they are sent in plain text.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user's browser and the Jenkins server.
*   **Passive Monitoring:** This could happen through network sniffing if the traffic was unencrypted, or by having some capability to intercept the communication.
*   **User Interaction:** The user must be interacting with the configuration form at the time of attack.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the plugin transmits the password in plain text while the user is viewing or submitting the configuration.
*   As of the publication date of the advisory, no fix is available for this plugin.
*   The severity is rated as Low since the access to the password requires a specific scenario and is not a direct remote exploit.
