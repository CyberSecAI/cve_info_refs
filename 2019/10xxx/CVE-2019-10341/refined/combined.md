# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1010 / CVE-2019-10340 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10341 (permission check)
Docker Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1400 / CVE-2019-10342
Docker Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users
configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1419 / CVE-2019-10346
Embeddable Build Status Plugin did not sanitize arguments provided in the
query string, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-775 / CVE-2019-10347
Mashup Portlets Plugin stored SonarQube credentials unencrypted on the
Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to
the master file system.

SECURITY-1438 / CVE-2019-10348
Gogs Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on the
Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1177 / CVE-2019-10349
Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin does not correctly escape the Display Name
value for jobs in Jenkins, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1441 / CVE-2019-10350
Port Allocator Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml
files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1437 / CVE-2019-10351
Caliper CI Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.
