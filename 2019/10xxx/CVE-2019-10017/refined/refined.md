Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the "Name" field of the "File Picker" feature when creating a new profile. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores the unsanitized user-provided input in the database. When this data is later displayed, the injected script is executed in the browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** An attacker can potentially take over administrator accounts by exploiting the XSS vulnerability.
- **Cookie Hijacking:** The injected JavaScript can be used to steal user cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the "File Picker" feature in the CMS Made Simple admin dashboard.
- The vulnerability requires the attacker to have access to the administrative interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to access the admin dashboard.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate to the File Picker feature and create a new profile.

**Summary of the attack:**
1. The attacker logs in to the admin interface.
2. The attacker navigates to the File Picker feature.
3. The attacker initiates the process of creating a new profile.
4. In the "Name" field, the attacker injects a malicious script (e.g., `<svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>`).
5. Upon saving, the malicious script is stored in the database.
6. Every time the "File Picker" page is loaded, the malicious script is executed within the user's browser.
