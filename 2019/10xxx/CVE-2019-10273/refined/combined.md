     ![Duane LaFlotte](/_astro/duane.CAyBZp_-.png)
### Duane LaFlotte

CTO, Pulsar Security

  I feel like every person's first experience in cybersecurity should be OffSec. Before you go out to figure out how to create a zero-day and you get confused, if you start with OffSec, that won't happen due to how methodologically all the training is put together.      ![Emile Kok](/_astro/emile.C3f2EqfQ.png)
### Emile Kok

Founder and Managing Director, TSTC Institute

  When going to the real world, you have to know what you're doing and understand what is expected from you on the job. For us, OffSec is the champion in this league in educating and preparing learners.      ![Douglas Costa](/_astro/douglas.BdxOPM2d.png)

# Exploit Title: ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus - 9.3 User enumeration vulnerability
# Date: 2019-03-29
# Exploit Author: Operat0r
# Vendor Homepage: https://www.manageengine.com/
# Software Link: https://www.manageengine.com/products/service-desk/download.html
# Version: 9.3
# Tested on: Ubuntu Linux
# CVE : CVE-2019-10273

ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus - 9.3 User enumeration vulnerability
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Overview:
CVE-2019-10273 is a information leakage vulnerability within the ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus 9.3 software, this vulnerability allows for the enumeration of active users that are registered on the ServiceDesk 9.3 hosted software.

Due to a flaw within the way the authentication is handled, an attacked is able to login and verify any active account.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Steps to reproduce: These steps can also be used to exploit authentication to privilege escalate into a higher level account via authentication bypass. (More info about authentication can be found with CVE-2019-10008)

- Start with logging into the guest account on the login page http://examplesite.com:8080, this will allow the first set of authentication to take place. (An attacker can use the guest credentials, this can be any low level user, or even the default applications credentials, Username: guest Password:guest)
- Navigate to the mobile login form located at http://examplesite.com:8080/mc, you will see that you have automatically be authenticated with whichever account you decided to previously login with.
- Logout of the mobile form at http://examplesite.com:8080/mc

- Re-login with any username, and the application will see that you have already been authenticated and it will not require a valid password.
- If you are able to successfully be automatically authenticated, you can confirm that the user is an active user within the service.
- You may now intercept and capture the login request with Burp Suite to set up a bruteforce attack, the http://examplesite.com:8080/mc will not try and prevent a barrage of requests. There is no protection set up within the services application

Conclusion:

Through the exploitation of the way that the application handles user authentication, an attacker is given the ability to bruteforce and confirm any active users on the service.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Impact and larger implication:

User enumeration is where an attacker is able to use a dictionary / bruteforce attack to guess or confirm valid and active users within the system. This is classified as a web application user enumeration vulnerability.

The impact that the vulnerability CVE-2019-10273 may have. It will allow an attacker to remotely enumerate all the users that are actively registered. This can lead to attacking specific accounts or targeting higher level accounts in order to privilege escalate on the service. Being able to verify whether or not a specific username is valid within a service can be detrimental to the users on the service.

---------------------------------------------------------------

References and other information

Utilizing CVE-2019-10008 we are able to bypass the login, CVE-2019-10273 further exploits the user authentication bug which is found within the ManageEngine 9.3 application.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
