Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10013:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `get_asn1_length()` function of the axTLS library. The function's result, which represents the length of an ASN.1 structure, is not checked for a minimum or maximum size before being used to allocate memory using `malloc()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Uncontrolled memory allocation:** The `get_asn1_length()` function's result is directly used to allocate memory, without any bounds checking. A malicious actor can supply a crafted ASN.1 structure, causing the `get_asn1_length()` function to return a large value (e.g., the maximum integer value), leading to allocation of excessive memory with `malloc()`.
- **Integer Overflow (Potential):** While not explicitly stated, if a large value is provided as the length, the division by 2 may also lead to an integer overflow in some cases, though the primary issue is uncontrolled allocation and memory exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing a crafted ASN.1 structure, an attacker can force the vulnerable system to allocate a massive amount of memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion, high CPU usage, and ultimately disrupt the availability of the service or system running the vulnerable axTLS library. The excessive memory allocation is often followed by a memcpy of similar size further exacerbating the impact.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Remote exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending a specially crafted TLS certificate handshake message that contains a malicious ASN.1 structure.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable service utilizing the axTLS library.
- **Knowledge of TLS Handshake:** An attacker needs to be able to manipulate the TLS handshake and embed a malicious ASN.1 structure that will be processed by the vulnerable axTLS component.
