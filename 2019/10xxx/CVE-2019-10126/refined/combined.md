Debian Bug     : 928989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
    validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
    attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-11815

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
    Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
    privilege escalation.  This protocol module (rds) is not auto-
    loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
    it is explicitly loaded.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c0)  Kirill Kolyshkin    2019-06-11 00:40:42 UTC  ``` Description of problem:  The kernel returns EACCES when trying to write an empty value to /proc/self/attr/keycreate. According to Dan Walsh, writing an empty value is legitimate way to tell "reset it to whatever defaults are there", and yet the kernel returns an error. I believe this is a bug.  Here's a repro and how it works:  [root@kir-ce7-selinux-01 ~]# cat a.c  #include <sys/types.h> #include <sys/stat.h> #include <fcntl.h> #include <unistd.h> #include <stdio.h>  int main(void) { 	int fd, r;  	fd = open("/proc/self/attr/keycreate", O_WRONLY); 	if (fd < 0) { 		perror("open"); 	}  	r = write(fd, "", 0); 	if (r < 0) { 		perror("write"); 	}  	return 0; }  [root@kir-ce7-selinux-01 ~]# uname -a Linux kir-ce7-selinux-01 3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue May 14 21:24:32 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux  [root@kir-ce7-selinux-01 ~]# gcc -Wall -O2 -o a a.c  [root@kir-ce7-selinux-01 ~]# ./a write: Permission denied [root@kir-ce7-selinux-01 ~]# strace ./a ... open("/proc/self/attr/keycreate", O_WRONLY) = 3 write(3, "", 0)                         = -1 EACCES (Permission denied) ...   NOTE you need a freshly booted kernel for that. Something like yum update container-selinux makes the bug disappear (I suspect something in the post-install scripts resets the selinux state in the kernel or something).  Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable):  [root@kir-ce7-selinux-01 ~]# uname -a Linux kir-ce7-selinux-01 3.10.0-957.12.2.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Tue May 14 21:24:32 UTC 2019 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux   How reproducible:  See above. NOTE you need a freshly booted kernel for that. Something like yum update container-selinux makes the bug disappear (I suspect something in the post-install scripts resets the selinux state in the kernel or something).  Actual results:  See above (EACCES returned from write).   Expected results:  No error.  Additional info:  This breaks runc, containerd, and docker :)   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c2)  Kirill Kolyshkin    2019-06-11 01:50:50 UTC  ``` I am always able to reproduce it on a freshly installed (latest) CentOS. Once I do something, say install container-selinux package, the bug disappears entirely, and removing container-selinux won't help. Sometimes a reboot helps to bring it back, sometimes not, and to repro I have to install a fresh CentOS system.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c4)  Ondrej Mosnacek    2019-06-12 07:54:28 UTC  ``` After going through the code, I agree that this is a bug. The kernel shouldn't check the key/create permission when the value is being cleared. The bug has been present upstream since the very introduction of the keycreate file (almost 13 years)...  I'll send a fix to upstream soon. It is not clear at this point whether we will fix this in RHEL-7 or defer to RHEL-8.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c5)  Ondrej Mosnacek    2019-06-12 08:17:03 UTC  ``` Patch posted upstream: [https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/20190612081226.21004-1-omosnace@redhat.com/T/](https://lore.kernel.org/selinux/20190612081226.21004-1-omosnace%40redhat.com/T/)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c6)  Daniel Walsh    2019-06-12 08:48:35 UTC  ``` I think this is fine in RHEL7, we can work around with the updated container-selinux policy.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c7)  Ondrej Mosnacek    2019-06-12 10:49:58 UTC  ``` Thanks, Dan. I'm moving this to RHEL-8 then.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c8)  Ondrej Mosnacek    2019-06-13 09:12:43 UTC  ``` Upstream commit:  commit 464c258aa45b09f16aa0f05847ed8895873262d9 Author: Ondrej Mosnacek <omosnace> Date:   Wed Jun 12 10:12:26 2019 +0200      selinux: fix empty write to keycreate file  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/pcmoore/selinux.git/commit/?id=464c258aa45b09f16aa0f05847ed8895873262d9>   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1719067#c12)  Herton R.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1716992#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-06-04 13:57:11 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels implementation of the mwifiex wireless kernel driver.  A remote attacker in control of an wireless access point may be able to create a heap-overflow in the access-point handling code. This heap overflow may lead to memory corruption and possibly priviledge escalation.

                 CVE-2019-11884
Debian Bug     : 928989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
    validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
    attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-11815

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
    Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
    privilege escalation.  This protocol module (rds) is not auto-
    loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
    it is explicitly loaded.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.168-1+deb9u3.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.

tracker page at:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-07-08 11:28:36 UTC  ``` The Bluetooth BR/EDR encryption key negotiation protocol is vulnerable to packet injection that could allow an unauthenticated user to decrease the size of the entropy of the encryption key, potentially causing information disclosure and/or escalation of privileges via adjacent access. There is not currently any knowledge of this being exploited.  Note:  Not all bluetooth devices are vulnerable to this flaw. Only devices that can connect to another using BR/EDR encryption negotiation protocol.   CERT notification: <https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/918987/>  Upstream patches: <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=d5bb334a8e171b262e48f378bd2096c0ea458265> <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=693cd8ce3f882524a5d06f7800dd8492411877b3> <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=eca94432934fe5f141d084f2e36ee2c0e614cc04>  Branded site: <https://knobattack.com/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c2)  Huzaifa S. Sidhpurwala    2019-07-10 04:24:10 UTC  ``` This is a flaw in the bluetooth protocol. As per the report: "The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) is in the process of adjusting the specification to mitigate this issue. They are continuing to work with controller and host vendors to implement patches once the specification is changed, so be aware that patches and additional notifications may be coming from upstream vendors. We strongly recommend that these patches are implemented when they are available. We will communicate more information in regards to this vulnerability as we receive it."  Basically seems like a hardware issue to me.   The notice for CERT is a heads-up. We probably need to wait till we see "patches".   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c4)  Wade Mealing    2019-08-19 01:14:49 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  At this time there is no known mitigation if bluetooth hardware is to be continue to be used.   Replacing the hardware with its wired version and disabling bluetooth may be a suitable alternative for some environments.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c5)  Wade Mealing    2019-08-19 01:46:37 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1743055](show_bug.cgi?id=1743055 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-9506 kernel: : hardware: bluetooth : BR/EDR encryption key negotiation attacks (KNOB) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c9)  Wade Mealing    2019-08-19 02:55:14 UTC  ``` This flaw is rated as important due to the possible follow-on effects.  It is likely that if the attacker could intercept bluetooth keyboard input that this data would contain password input which would be immediately leveraged for further attacks.   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c11)  Justin M. Forbes    2019-08-19 12:41:13 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 5.0.15 stable kernel updates   ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c22)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-08 09:59:49 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 Extended Update Support  Via RHSA-2019:2975 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2975](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2975)   ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=1727857#c23)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-10-08 12:51:07 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# USN-4117-1: Linux kernel (AWS) vulnerabilities

2 September 2019

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems

## Details

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not

sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking

protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux

devices. ([CVE-2019-10638](/security/CVE-2019-10638))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker

could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14283](/security/CVE-2019-14283))

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not

properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local

attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-14284](/security/CVE-2019-14284))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the

virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.

([CVE-2019-3900](/security/CVE-2019-3900))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

[slackware-security]  Slackware 14.2 kernel (SSA:2019-202-01)

New kernel packages are available for Slackware 14.2 to fix security issues.

Here are the details from the Slackware 14.2 ChangeLog:
+--------------------------+
patches/packages/linux-4.4.182/*:  Upgraded.
  These updates fix various bugs and many minor security issues.
  Be sure to upgrade your initrd after upgrading the kernel packages.
  If you use lilo to boot your machine, be sure lilo.conf points to the correct
  kernel and initrd and run lilo as root to update the bootloader.
  If you use elilo to boot your machine, you should run eliloconfig to copy the
  kernel and initrd to the EFI System Partition.
  For more information, see:

# upgradepkg kernel-*.txz

If you are using an initrd, you'll need to rebuild it.

For a 32-bit SMP machine, use this command (substitute the appropriate
kernel version if you are not running Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.186-smp | bash

For a 64-bit machine, or a 32-bit uniprocessor machine, use this command
(substitute the appropriate kernel version if you are not running
Slackware 14.2):
# /usr/share/mkinitrd/mkinitrd_command_generator.sh -k 4.4.186 | bash

Please note that "uniprocessor" has to do with the kernel you are running,
not with the CPU. Most systems should run the SMP kernel (if they can)
regardless of the number of cores the CPU has. If you aren't sure which
kernel you are running, run "uname -a". If you see SMP there, you are
running the SMP kernel and should use the 4.4.186-smp version when running
mkinitrd_command_generator. Note that this is only for 32-bit -- 64-bit
systems should always use 4.4.186 as the version.

If you are using lilo or elilo to boot the machine, you'll need to ensure
that the machine is properly prepared before rebooting.

If using LILO:
By default, lilo.conf contains an image= line that references a symlink
that always points to the correct kernel. No editing should be required
unless your machine uses a custom lilo.conf. If that is the case, be sure
that the image= line references the correct kernel file.  Either way,
you'll need to run "lilo" as root to reinstall the boot loader.

If using elilo:
Ensure that the /boot/vmlinuz symlink is pointing to the kernel you wish
to use, and then run eliloconfig to update the EFI System Partition.

# CVE-2019-10639

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-10638.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-10649.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-10639 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10639)

#### Description

The Linux kernel 4.x (starting from 4.1) and 5.x before 5.0.8 allows Information Exposure (partial kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address associated with a network namespace.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [linux](/security/cves?package=linux) - Linux kernel
* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-kvm](/security/cves?package=linux-kvm) - Linux kernel for cloud environments
* [linux-raspi2](/security/cves?package=linux-raspi2) - Linux kernel for Raspberry Pi 2

## Details

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

Jann Horn discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when

performing core dumps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of

service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11599](/security/CVE-2019-11599))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

An update that solves 7 vulnerabilities and has 45 fixes is
now available.
Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.0 was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-10638: A device can be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID
values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and
ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses,
it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter
array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack
may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC
to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses (bnc#1140575).
- CVE-2019-10639: The Linux kernel allowed Information Exposure (partial
kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it
is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID
values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and
ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses,
it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter
array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key
contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so
when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel
image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the
attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain
other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to
send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic
is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client
targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or
gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP
addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because
IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address
associated with a network namespace (bnc#1140577).
- CVE-2018-20836: There was a race condition in smp\_task\_timedout() and
smp\_task\_done() in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c, leading to a
use-after-free (bnc#1134395).
- CVE-2019-10126: A heap based buffer overflow in
mwifiex\_uap\_parse\_tail\_ies function in
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/ie.c might lead to memory
corruption and possibly other consequences (bnc#1136935).
- CVE-2019-11599: The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel did not
use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags
changes while it runs, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive
information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified
other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget\_not\_zero or
get\_task\_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c,
fs/proc/task\_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs\_main.c
(bnc#1131645 1133738).
- CVE-2019-12614: An issue was discovered in dlpar\_parse\_cc\_property in
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c where there was an unchecked
kstrdup of prop->name, which might allow an attacker to cause a denial
of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) (bnc#1137194).
- CVE-2018-16871: A flaw was found in NFS where an attacker who is able to
mount an exported NFS filesystem was able to trigger a null pointer
dereference by an invalid NFS sequence. (bnc#1137103).
The following non-security bugs were fixed:

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

                 CVE-2019-11884
Debian Bug     : 928989

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-9500, CVE-2019-9503

    Hugues Anguelkov discovered a buffer overflow and missing access
    validation in the Broadcom FullMAC wifi driver (brcmfmac), which a
    attacker on the same wifi network could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 536 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.

CVE-2019-11486

    Jann Horn of Google reported numerous race conditions in the
    Siemens R3964 line discipline. A local user could use these to
    cause unspecified security impact. This module has therefore been
    disabled.

CVE-2019-11599

    Jann Horn of Google reported a race condition in the core dump
    implementation which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this to read sensitive information, to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption), or for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-11815

    It was discovered that a use-after-free in the Reliable Datagram
    Sockets protocol could result in denial of service and potentially
    privilege escalation.  This protocol module (rds) is not auto-
    loaded on Debian systems, so this issue only affects systems where
    it is explicitly loaded.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.168-1+deb9u3~deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

# CVE-2018-16871

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2018-16869.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2018-16872.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2018-16871 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-16871)

#### Description

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS implementation, all versions 3.x and all versions 4.x up to 4.20. An attacker, who is able to mount an exported NFS filesystem, is able to trigger a null pointer dereference by using an invalid NFS sequence. This can panic the machine and deny access to the NFS server. Any outstanding disk writes to the NFS server will be lost.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c0)  Wade Mealing    2019-06-27 01:17:22 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in Intel graphics hardware (GPU) where a local attacker with the ability to issue an ioctl could trigger a hardware level crash if MMIO registers were read while the graphics card was in a low-power state.  This creates a denial of service situation and the GPU and connected displays will remain unusable until a reboot occurs.  Intel plans to release BIOS firmware, along with updates supplied by Red Hat should mitigate this vulnerability.  Some older hardware will not have  BIOS firmware update and will rely on operating system level protection to prevent access while the device is in low-power states.   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c16)  Wade Mealing    2019-10-29 00:54:48 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Preventing loading of the i915 kernel module will prevent attackers from using this exploit against the system however the power management functionality of the card will be disabled and the system may draw additional power. See this KCS article (<https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278>) for instructions on how to disable a kernel module. Graphical displays may also be at low resolution or not work correctly.  This mitigation may not be suitable if running graphical tools locally is required.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c17)  Wade Mealing    2019-11-04 04:21:02 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Intel   ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=1724393#c19)  Wade Mealing    2019-11-12 09:55:45 UTC  ``` Statement:  Intel plans to release BIOS firmware to correct this issue. Red Hat's kernel update should mitigate this vulnerability. Some older hardware will not have BIOS firmware update and will rely on operating system level protection to prevent access while the device is in low-power states.

# CVE-2019-10638

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-10557.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-10639.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-10638 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10638)

#### Description

In the Linux kernel before 5.1.7, a device can be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses, it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses.

Description:
The openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel was updated to receive various security and
bugfixes.
The following security bugs were fixed:
- CVE-2019-10638: A device could be tracked by an attacker using the IP ID
values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and
ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses,
it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter
array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). An attack
may be conducted by hosting a crafted web page that uses WebRTC or gQUIC
to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses (bnc#1140575).
- CVE-2019-10639: The Linux kernel allowed Information Exposure (partial
kernel address disclosure), leading to a KASLR bypass. Specifically, it
is possible to extract the KASLR kernel image offset using the IP ID
values the kernel produces for connection-less protocols (e.g., UDP and
ICMP). When such traffic is sent to multiple destination IP addresses,
it is possible to obtain hash collisions (of indices to the counter
array) and thereby obtain the hashing key (via enumeration). This key
contains enough bits from a kernel address (of a static variable) so
when the key is extracted (via enumeration), the offset of the kernel
image is exposed. This attack can be carried out remotely, by the
attacker forcing the target device to send UDP or ICMP (or certain
other) traffic to attacker-controlled IP addresses. Forcing a server to
send UDP traffic is trivial if the server is a DNS server. ICMP traffic
is trivial if the server answers ICMP Echo requests (ping). For client
targets, if the target visits the attacker's web page, then WebRTC or
gQUIC can be used to force UDP traffic to attacker-controlled IP
addresses. NOTE: this attack against KASLR became viable in 4.1 because
IP ID generation was changed to have a dependency on an address
associated with a network namespace (bnc#1140577).
- CVE-2019-13233: In arch/x86/lib/insn-eval.c there was a use-after-free
for access to an LDT entry because of a race condition between
modify\_ldt() and a #BR exception for an MPX bounds violation
(bnc#1140454).
- CVE-2018-20836: There was a race condition in smp\_task\_timedout() and
smp\_task\_done() in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas\_expander.c, leading to a
use-after-free (bnc#1134395).
- CVE-2019-10126: A heap based buffer overflow in
mwifiex\_uap\_parse\_tail\_ies function in
drivers/net/wireless/marvell/mwifiex/ie.c might have lead to memory
corruption and possibly other consequences (bnc#1136935).
- CVE-2019-11599: The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel did not
use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags
changes while it runs, which allowed local users to obtain sensitive
information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified
other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget\_not\_zero or
get\_task\_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c,
fs/proc/task\_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs\_main.c
(bnc#1133738).
- CVE-2019-12817: arch/powerpc/mm/mmu\_context\_book3s64.c in the Linux
kernel for powerpc has a bug where unrelated processes may be able to
read/write to one another's virtual memory under certain conditions via
an mmap above 512 TB. Only a subset of powerpc systems are affected
(bnc#1138263).
- CVE-2019-12614: An issue was discovered in dlpar\_parse\_cc\_property in
arch/powerpc/platforms/pseries/dlpar.c in the Linux kernel. There was an
unchecked kstrdup of prop->name, which might allow an attacker to cause
a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash)
(bnc#1137194).
- CVE-2018-16871: A NULL pointer dereference due to an anomalized NFS
message sequence was fixed. (bnc#1137103).

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 14.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=trusty)

## Packages

* [linux-aws](/security/cves?package=linux-aws) - Linux kernel for Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems
* [linux-lts-xenial](/security/cves?package=linux-lts-xenial) - Linux hardware enablement kernel from Xenial for Trusty

## Details

USN-4095-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 16.04

LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux

Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 16.04 LTS for Ubuntu

14.04 ESM.

Eli Biham and Lior Neumann discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in

the Linux kernel did not properly validate elliptic curve parameters during

Diffie-Hellman key exchange in some situations. An attacker could use this

to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2018-5383](/security/CVE-2018-5383))

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux

kernel did not properly zero out memory in some situations. A local

attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).

([CVE-2019-11833](/security/CVE-2019-11833))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel on ARM processors allowed a tracing

process to modify a syscall after a seccomp decision had been made on that

syscall. A local attacker could possibly use this to bypass seccomp

restrictions. ([CVE-2019-2054](/security/CVE-2019-2054))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

## Details

It was discovered that a heap buffer overflow existed in the Marvell

Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this

to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary

code. ([CVE-2019-10126](/security/CVE-2019-10126))

Andrei Vlad Lutas and Dan Lutas discovered that some x86 processors

incorrectly handle SWAPGS instructions during speculative execution. A

local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel

memory). ([CVE-2019-1125](/security/CVE-2019-1125))

It was discovered that the PowerPC dlpar implementation in the Linux kernel

did not properly check for allocation errors in some situations. A local

attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system

crash). ([CVE-2019-12614](/security/CVE-2019-12614))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in

the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A

local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).

([CVE-2019-12984](/security/CVE-2019-12984))

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel

when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use

this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-13233](/security/CVE-2019-13233))

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did

not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could

use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain

administrative privileges. ([CVE-2019-13272](/security/CVE-2019-13272))

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux

kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could

possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-3846](/security/CVE-2019-3846))

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws/4.15.0-1047.49)
* [linux-image-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws/4.15.0.1047.46)

##### Ubuntu 16.04

* [linux-image-4.15.0-1047-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-aws-hwe/4.15.0-1047.49~16.04.1)
* [linux-image-aws-hwe](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe)
  -
  [4.15.0.1047.47](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-meta-aws-hwe/4.15.0.1047.47)

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make

all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have

been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and

reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.

Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages

(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,

linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform

this as well.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

# CVE-2019-11599

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11598.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11627.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11599 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11599)

#### Description

The coredump implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.0.10 does not use locking or other mechanisms to prevent vma layout or vma flags changes while it runs, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service, or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a race condition with mmget\_not\_zero or get\_task\_mm calls. This is related to fs/userfaultfd.c, mm/mmap.c, fs/proc/task\_mmu.c, and drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs\_main.c.

Package        : linux
Version        : 3.16.68-2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3846 CVE-2019-5489 CVE-2019-10126 CVE-2019-11477
                 CVE-2019-11478 CVE-2019-11479 CVE-2019-11810 CVE-2019-11833
                 CVE-2019-11884

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2019-3846, CVE-2019-10126

    huangwen reported multiple buffer overflows in the Marvell wifi
    (mwifiex) driver, which a local user could use to cause denial of
    service or the execution of arbitrary code.

CVE-2019-5489

    Daniel Gruss, Erik Kraft, Trishita Tiwari, Michael Schwarz, Ari
    Trachtenberg, Jason Hennessey, Alex Ionescu, and Anders Fogh
    discovered that local users could use the mincore() system call to
    obtain sensitive information from other processes that access the
    same memory-mapped file.

CVE-2019-11477

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) allows a remotely triggerable
    kernel panic.

CVE-2019-11478

    Jonathan Looney reported that a specially crafted sequence of TCP
    selective acknowledgements (SACKs) will fragment the TCP
    retransmission queue, allowing an attacker to cause excessive
    resource usage.

CVE-2019-11479

    Jonathan Looney reported that an attacker could force the Linux
    kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of
    which contains only 8 bytes of data, drastically increasing the
    bandwidth required to deliver the same amount of data.

    This update introduces a new sysctl value to control the minimal MSS
    (net.ipv4.tcp_min_snd_mss), which by default uses the formerly hard-
    coded value of 48.  We recommend raising this to 512 unless you know
    that your network requires a lower value.  (This value applies to
    Linux 3.16 only.)

CVE-2019-11810

    It was discovered that the megaraid_sas driver did not correctly
    handle a failed memory allocation during initialisation, which
    could lead to a double-free.  This might have some security
    impact, but it cannot be triggered by an unprivileged user.

CVE-2019-11833

    It was discovered that the ext4 filesystem implementation writes
    uninitialised data from kernel memory to new extent blocks.  A
    local user able to write to an ext4 filesystem and then read the
    filesystem image, for example using a removable drive, might be
    able to use this to obtain sensitive information.

CVE-2019-11884

    It was discovered that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation did not
    ensure that new connection names were null-terminated.  A local
    user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability might be able to use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel stack.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
3.16.68-2.  Packages for PC architectures (amd64 and i386) are already
available, and packages for Arm architectures (armel and armhf) will be
available soon.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
