```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `a` function in the `component-flatten` library can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of `Object.prototype`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Prototype pollution vulnerability, which allows an attacker to modify the `Object.prototype`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially cause a denial-of-service or other unexpected behaviors by modifying the prototype chain.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a crafted object with a `__proto__` property, the attacker can manipulate the prototype of objects in JavaScript.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to pass a malicious object to the vulnerable `component-flatten` function. This does not require specific privileges, user interaction or local access."
