Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-10421:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Azure Event Grid Build Notifier Plugin stored the Azure Event Grid secret key in plain text within job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The plugin failed to encrypt the Azure Event Grid secret key before storing it in the configuration files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system or users with Extended Read permissions on Jenkins jobs can read the unencrypted secret key.
- This would allow the attacker to potentially impersonate the plugin and send notifications to the configured Azure Event Grid.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system can read the `config.xml` files.
- **Extended Read Permissions:** Users with "Extended Read" permissions on jobs in Jenkins can access the `config.xml` files through the Jenkins interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have either:
  - Access to the Jenkins controller file system, or
  - "Extended Read" permissions to jobs within Jenkins

**Additional Details:**
- No fix was available for this vulnerability at the time of the advisory's publication.
- This was identified as security issue **SECURITY-1544**
