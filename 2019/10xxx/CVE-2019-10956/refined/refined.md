Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-10956:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when processing user-supplied data, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   OS Command Injection (CWE-78)

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows a remote authenticated user to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the affected device. This could allow a complete compromise of the device including data exfiltration, modification, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted URL commands. This indicates the vulnerability is likely located within the web interface of the affected devices.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be authenticated on the device. This suggests that the attacker requires valid credentials for accessing the web interface.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send a specially crafted URL command to the device.
*   The attack can be executed remotely.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is an OS Command Injection that can be triggered by an authenticated remote attacker using specially crafted URL command, allowing for arbitrary code execution as root on the affected Geutebruck devices (G-Cam and G-Code).
