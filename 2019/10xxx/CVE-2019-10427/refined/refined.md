Vulnerability: Aqua MicroScanner Plugin showed plain text credential in configuration form.

*   **Affected Plugin:** Aqua MicroScanner Plugin
*   **Vulnerability:** The plugin stores a token credential in its global Jenkins configuration. While the token is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
*   **Root Cause:** The token credential was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
*   **Impact:** This could result in exposure of the token through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially intercept the plain text token when an administrator views the global configuration form.
*   **Mitigation:** Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now encrypts the token transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.
