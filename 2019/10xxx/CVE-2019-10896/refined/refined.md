    "Description": "In Wireshark 2.4.0 to 2.4.13, 2.6.0 to 2.6.7, and 3.0.0, the DOF dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dof.c by properly handling generated IID and OID bytes.",
    "Root cause": "Improper handling of generated IID and OID bytes in the DOF dissector.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The DOF dissector doesn't properly handle generated IID and OID bytes"
     ],
    "Impact": "A crash of the Wireshark application.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By injecting a malformed packet onto the wire.",
       "By convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to either have a position to inject malformed packets into network traffic being captured by Wireshark or convince a user to open a malicious packet trace file."
