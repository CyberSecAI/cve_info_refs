  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "CSRF tokens in OpenShift Container Platform's cluster console component do not refresh during a user's session.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF tokens remain static throughout a user's session.",
      "CSRF tokens are exposed in the URL."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can observe the CSRF token can reuse it to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Observing the CSRF token value (as it is exposed in the URL).",
      "Reusing the observed token to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim."

    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to observe the CSRF token, which is exposed in the URL.",
   "affected_components": [
      "openshift-enterprise-console-container"

    "affected_versions": [
      "OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.11 and later"
    ],
  "additional_details": [
        "OpenShift Container Platform versions prior to 3.11 are not affected because they do not include the 'cluster console' component.",
         "The issue is that CSRF tokens are exposed in the URL, not that they do not change.",
         "Rotating the tokens would mitigate the concern given that websockets requests cannot have them embedded in a custom header."
