WORKAROUNDS

AND
MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to reduce the risk:

* Disable SNMP in Versions 1 and 2c, if supported by the product.
* Enable SNMP v3 if required and supported by the product to restrict the vulnerability to authenticated users.
* Enable access protection and change default credentials for SNMP service, if possible
* Restrict network access to port 161/udp of the affected product.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section
[Affected Products and Solution](#affected-products-section).

Please follow the [General Security Recommendations](#general-recommendations).

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens' operational guidelines for Industrial Security (Download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and to follow the recommendations in the product manuals.
Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Disable SNMP in Versions 1 and 2c, if supported by the product.
• Enable SNMP v3 if required and supported by the product to restrict the vulnerability to authenticated

users.

• Enable access protection and change default credentials for SNMP service, if possible
• Restrict network access to port 161/udp of the affected product.

Product-specific remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by
Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Development/Evaluation Kits for PROFINET IO are used to develop compact or modular PROFINET field
devices.

PN/PN coupler is used for connecting two PROFINET networks.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

SIMATIC CP 1604 and CP 1616 are PCI/PCI-104 cards for high-performance connection of field devices
to Industrial Ethernet with PROFINET.

SIMATIC ET 200 Interface modules for PROFINET IO are used to connect field devices (IO Devices) to
controllers (IO Controller) via PROFINET.

SIMATIC S7-300 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-400 controllers have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial environ-
ments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SIMATIC WinAC RTX is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMOTION is a scalable high performance hardware and software system for motion control.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same firmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10923

An attacker with network access to an affected product may cause a denial of service condition by
breaking the real-time synchronization (IRT) of the affected installation.

Publication Date
Added solution for SINAMICS SL150 V4.7, SIPLUS devices now explicitly men-
tioned in the list of affected products, correction in section "Workarounds and
Mitigations"
Added solution for SINAMICS DCP
Added solution for SIMATIC S7-300 CPU family
Added SIMATIC ET200ecoPN product variants (MLFB IDs) that are not affected
Added additional SIMATIC ET200ecoPN model (6ES7148-6JG00-0BB0) as not
affected
Clarified affected ET200ecoPN models
