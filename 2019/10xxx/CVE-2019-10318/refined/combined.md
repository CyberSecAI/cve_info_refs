SECURITY-1100 / CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to
display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis
Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of
each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a
permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the
per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and
POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

SECURITY-930 / CVE-2019-10317
SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for
the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that. Instead, it now has an opt-in option
to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

SECURITY-1252 / CVE-2019-10309
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover
Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser
in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows
unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a
maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary
files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1355 (1) / CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)
Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer
permissions.

SECURITY-1355 (2) / CVE-2019-10312
Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be
used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1390 / CVE-2019-10318
Azure AD Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global config.xml
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Azure AD Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

SECURITY-1143 / CVE-2019-10313
Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file
on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-936 / CVE-2019-10314
Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-443 / CVE-2019-10315
GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to
prevent CSRF. This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided
during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim. If
the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be
attached to the attacker’s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

SECURITY-1380 / CVE-2019-10316
Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

# Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD)

How to install

* [Releases](/azure-ad/releases/)
* [Issues](/azure-ad/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/azure-ad/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/azure-ad/healthscore/)

> ***Important***: This plug-in is maintained by the Jenkins community and won’t be supported by Microsoft as of February 29, 2024.

A Jenkins Plugin that supports authentication & authorization via Microsoft Entra ID ([previously known as Azure Active Directory](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/fundamentals/new-name)).

## Setup In Microsoft Entra ID

1. Open `Microsoft Entra ID`, click `App registrations`
2. Click `New registration`
3. Add a new Reply URL `https://{your_jenkins_host}/securityRealm/finishLogin`. Make sure "Jenkins URL" (Manage Jenkins => Configure System) is set to the same value as `https://{your_jenkins_host}`.
4. Click `Certificates & secrets`

   * To use a client secret: Under Client secrets, click `New client secret` to generate a new key. Copy the `value`, it will be used as `Client Secret` in Jenkins.
   * To use a certificate: Under Certificates, click `Upload certificate` to upload your certificate. This certificate will be used for client certificate authentication in Jenkins. You will need to use the corresponding private key associated with this certificate in PEM format.
5. Click `Authentication`, under 'Implicit grant and hybrid flows', enable `ID tokens`.
6. (optional) To enable Microsoft Entra ID group support: Click `Manifest` and modify the `"groupMembershipClaims": null` value to `"groupMembershipClaims": "SecurityGroup"`, then 'Save' it.

### Setup Microsoft Entra ID permissions (optional, but recommended)

In order for Jenkins to be able to lookup data from Microsoft Entra ID it needs some Graph API permissions.

This is used for:

* Autocompleting users and groups on the 'Security' page
* Jenkins looking up the user, e.g. when you use the Rest API
* Group display name support (rather than just object ID)

*Note: You can skip this part and just use the claims returned when authenticating.*

1. Click `API permissions`
2. Add a permission
3. Microsoft Graph
4. Application permissions
5. Add 'User.Read.All', 'Group.Read.All' and 'People.Read.All'
6. Click `Grant admin consent`. If you are not an admin in your tenant, please contact an admin to grant the permissions.

## Setup In Jenkins

Click `Manage Jenkins` in the left menu, then click `Security`

## Authentication

1. Check `Azure Active Directory` and fill in the credential.
2. Click `Verify Application` to make sure your input is valid.
3. Save the configuration, (logged-in users will have permission to do anything)
4. Log in with Microsoft Entra ID
5. Return to 'Security' to configure authorization

*Note: if you haven't setup Graph API permissions, verify application will fail, skip over this step*

## Authorization

Jenkins will match permissions based on the Object ID of a user or group.

This plugin extends the traditional [Matrix Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth/) with the ability to search by users / groups by display name when configuring the authorization rules.

To use this feature:

1. Click `Azure Active Directory Matrix-based security`
2. Search for user in 'Azure User/group to add' and click Add
3. Select the permission(s) in the table
4. Click 'Apply'

You can still use other authorization strategies such as:

* [Matrix Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/matrix-auth/)
* [Folder-based Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/folder-auth/)
* [Role-based Authorization Strategy](https://plugins.jenkins.io/role-strategy/)

The following can normally be used:

* Object ID of user or group
* Display name of group (Only if Graph API permissions granted)
* `preferred_username` claim which is normally the 'User principal name', but not always.

## Configuration as Code and Job DSL support

The plugin has full support for use in Configuration as Code and Job DSL.

For an example combining the two, see the [configuration-as-code.yml](https://github.com/jenkinsci/azure-ad-plugin/blob/master/./src/test/resources/com/microsoft/jenkins/azuread/integrations/casc/configuration-as-code.yml) test resource.

## FAQ

#### Q: How to recover if Jenkins keeps failing during the login phase?

A: You can disable the security from the config file (see <https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/security/access-control/disable/>)

#### Q: Why am I getting an error "insufficient privileges to complete the operation" even after having granted the permission?

A: It can take a long time for the privileges to take effect, which could be 10-20 minutes. Just wait for a while and try again.
