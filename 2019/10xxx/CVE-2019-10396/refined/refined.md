Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10396:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Dashboard View Plugin for Jenkins did not properly escape the build description on the "Latest Builds View." This lack of escaping allowed for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw. Malicious JavaScript code could be injected into the build description field.
- Insufficient Output Sanitization: The plugin failed to sanitize or escape the user-controlled build description before rendering it on the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the ability for an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser when they view the "Latest Builds View" in the Jenkins Dashboard.
- An attacker could potentially perform actions such as:
   - Stealing session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
   - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
   - Modifying the content of the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Performing other client-side attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves manipulating the build description field within Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to have the ability to control the build description. This often means having either:
    - Job/Configure permission: Allows an attacker to directly modify the build description within the job's configuration.
    - Job/Build permission: This allows an attacker to inject malicious content through the build process that affects the description.
- The attacker needs to be able to cause a build to execute so that the modified description can be stored in Jenkins.
- The vulnerability is triggered when other users with access to the dashboard view the compromised build.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a stored XSS, because the malicious payload is stored on the Jenkins server in the build description.
- The fix involves applying the configured markup formatter to the build description, effectively treating it as any other content in Jenkins and rendering it appropriately with proper escaping to prevent interpretation as code.
