Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following
releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin 1.0.5
* Beaker builder Plugin 1.10
* Build Environment Plugin 1.7
* Dashboard View Plugin 2.12
* Git client Plugin 2.8.5
* Script Security Plugin 1.63

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-09-12/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1534 / CVE-2019-10392
Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation
of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the
specified URL. This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the
Jenkins master as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

SECURITY-1538 / CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
any of the following:

- Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
- Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of
  assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
- Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement
  expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
- Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not
  involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1476 / CVE-2019-10395
Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables
shown on its views. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment
variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

SECURITY-1489 / CVE-2019-10396
Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest
Builds View. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on
that view.

SECURITY-1509 / CVE-2019-10397
Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job
configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1545 / CVE-2019-10398
Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins
master. This password could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Aqua Security Serverless Scanner
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-serverless)
* [Beaker builder
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/beaker-builder)
* [Build Environment
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-environment)

## Descriptions

### System command execution vulnerability in Git client Plugin

**SECURITY-1534
/
CVE-2019-10392**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-client`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client)**

**Description:**

Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the specified URL.
This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the Jenkins controller as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

Git client Plugin now rejects repository URLs that do not appear to be valid URLs.
Additionally, for versions of Git that support it, the repository URL argument is separated from option arguments using the `--` separator to prevent interpretation as an option.

As of publication of this advisory, no update for users of prerelease versions of 3.x such as 3.0.0-rc is available.
Users of Git client Plugin 3.0.0-rc are advised to downgrade to 2.8.5 (and downgrade [Git Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git) from 4.0.0-rc to the latest 3.x release to resolve dependency problems).

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1538
/
CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through any of the following:

* Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
* Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
* Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
* Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Build Environment Plugin

**SECURITY-1476
/
CVE-2019-10395**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`build-environment`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-environment)**

**Description:**

Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables shown on its views.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

Build Environment Plugin now escapes all variables displayed in its views.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Dashboard View Plugin

**SECURITY-1489
/
CVE-2019-10396**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dashboard-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dashboard-view)**

**Description:**

Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest Builds View.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on that view.

Dashboard View Plugin now applies the configured markup formatter to the build description, rendering it as it appears elsewhere in Jenkins.

### Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin showed plain text password in job configuration form fields

**SECURITY-1509
/
CVE-2019-10397**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`aqua-serverless`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-serverless)**

**Description:**

Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin no longer transmits the password form field in plain text.

### Beaker builder Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1545
/
CVE-2019-10398**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`beaker-builder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/beaker-builder)**

**Description:**

Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Beaker builder Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1476:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1489:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1509:

* SECURITY-1538:
