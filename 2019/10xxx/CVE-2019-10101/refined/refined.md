Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the practice of resolving project artifacts (dependencies) over unencrypted HTTP connections instead of HTTPS. This was due to a single character typo in the configuration of build files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** By using HTTP instead of HTTPS, the communication between the client (developer machine/build server) and the artifact repository is not encrypted or authenticated. This allows an attacker positioned between the client and the server to intercept the traffic, and modify the downloaded artifacts.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checking:** The use of HTTP is often coupled with the lack of integrity checking such as verifying the downloaded file with checksums or digital signatures, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the downloaded dependencies.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Code Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code into downloaded JAR files, potentially leading to a wide range of compromises. This malicious code would then be executed when the application is built or run.
*   **Supply Chain Compromise:** By compromising a library or component used by other projects, the attacker can propagate the malicious code to all projects using that vulnerable component.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Once the malicious code is executed, an attacker can gain control of the affected system, steal credentials, or conduct further malicious activities.
*   **Trusting Trust Attack:** In the case of compilers like Kotlin, a compromised build process can lead to a compromised compiler being used to build subsequent versions of the compiler, perpetuating the compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Interception:** Attackers can intercept HTTP traffic through various means, including malicious Wi-Fi hotspots, compromised network devices, or by leveraging their position as an ISP.
*   **Compromised Artifact Mirror:** If an organization or project mirrors artifacts over HTTP, they could be vulnerable to a cache poisoning attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Position:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the developer/build server and the artifact repository.
*   **Ability to Serve Malicious Artifacts:** The attacker needs the capability to serve malicious JAR files to the vulnerable client requesting the dependency.
