Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-10943:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper integrity checks when modifying the user program on the affected PLCs. Specifically, it's possible to alter the user program in a way that the actual running code on the device differs from the source code stored on the device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Integrity Check (CWE-353):** The primary weakness is the absence of a mechanism to ensure that the running code matches the stored source code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Program Modification:** An attacker could alter the behavior of the PLC by modifying the actual running code.
- **Integrity Loss:** An engineer attempting to retrieve the user program would obtain source code that is different from what is actually being executed on the PLC. This impacts the reliability and auditability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected devices, specifically port 102/tcp.
- **Program Modification Capability:** The attacker needs to have the ability to change the user program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network connectivity to the targeted device.
- The attacker must be able to modify the user program.

**Affected Products:**
- SIMATIC Drive Controller family
- SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC2 (all versions < V20.8)
- SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller CPU 1515SP PC (all versions)
- SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU family (all versions < V4.4.0)
