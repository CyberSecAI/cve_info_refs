Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10084:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that Impala query and session IDs, which are used to interact with active sessions and queries, are not treated as sensitive secrets. These IDs were not generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator, making them predictable through random number generator attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Predictable IDs:** Session and query IDs are predictable due to the use of a weak random number generator.
*   **Lack of Secret Treatment:** Session and query IDs were not treated as secrets, making them potentially exposed in logs, debug pages, and administrative interfaces.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to interact with sessions or queries belonging to other users without proper authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can potentially hijack sessions or queries from other authenticated users, gaining privileges that are not assigned to them, especially in Impala deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger enabled.
*   **Incorrect Audit Logging:** An attacker could undertake actions that are logged under the name of a different authenticated user, leading to inaccurate audit trails.
*   **Authorization Bypass:**  An attacker can bypass the authorization mechanisms in place by interacting with another user's session or query.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Specially-constructed requests:** An authenticated attacker can interact with other sessions or queries using specially crafted requests, exploiting the predictable nature of IDs.
*   **Exposure of IDs:** IDs can be obtained from logs, debug pages, and administrative interfaces.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an authenticated account on the Impala system.
*   **Access to IDs:** The attacker needs to obtain the query or session IDs of other users. This might be achieved by accessing logs, debug pages, or administrative interfaces, or through prediction by exploiting the weak random number generator.
*   **Technical Sophistication:** The attacker needs a high degree of technical skill to construct the necessary malicious requests and execute the attack.

**Mitigation:**
*   Upgrade to Impala version 3.3.0 or higher which includes a fix that introduces session secrets.
*   Restrict access to debug pages, administrative interfaces, and logs that might expose session and query IDs.
*   Limit access to the Impala deployment to trusted users.
