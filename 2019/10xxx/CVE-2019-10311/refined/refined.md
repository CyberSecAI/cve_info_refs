The provided content relates to CVE-2019-10311.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation and did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users with Overall/Read access can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker leverages the vulnerable form validation method.
- Lack of POST request enforcement allows CSRF attacks.
- An attacker needs Overall/Read access and knowledge of a valid credential ID to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- They need to know a valid credential ID, obtained through another method, that can be used when exploiting the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to craft a request to the form validation method.
