### smb 1 create andx request does not parse the filename correctly (master)

**Description**

I noticed that for the filenames of smb 1 create\_andx\_requests the first character of the filename was missing. I have isolated a flow from a pcap which it was pretty clear the first character was missing: Filename 'rowser' != 'browser' in packet 14.

```
{"timestamp":"2018-06-29T18:57:58.255379+0200","flow_id":202610335734381,"pcap_cnt":16,"event_type":"smb","src_ip":"172.16.1.102","src_port":49473,"dest_ip":"172.16.1.8","dest_port":445,"proto":"TCP","smb":{"id":6,"dialect":"NT LM 0.12","command":"SMB1_COMMAND_NT_CREATE_ANDX","status":"STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED","status_code":"0xc0000022","session_id":2048,"tree_id":2048,"filename":"rowser","disposition":"FILE_OPEN","access":"normal","created":0,"accessed":0,"modified":0,"changed":0,"size":0,"fuid":""}}

```

In the function parse\_smb\_create\_andx\_request\_record in smb1\_records.rs the second \_skip is skipping 1 byte to much.

"\_skip2: take!(8)" should be "\_skip2: take!(7)"

From after the parsing of the create\_options we should skip:
impersonation (4)
security\_flags (2)
byte\_count (1)
file\_name: (file\_len)
