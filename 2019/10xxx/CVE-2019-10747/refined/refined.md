{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `set-value` function in the `set-value` npm package could be tricked into adding or modifying properties of `Object.prototype` using `constructor`, `prototype`, and `__proto__` payloads.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify properties of `Object.prototype`, leading to potential denial of service, data integrity issues, or other unexpected behaviors in applications using the vulnerable library.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing specially crafted input to the `set-value` function using dot notation path, like 'constructor.prototype.a0', '__proto__.a1'.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input given to the `set-value` function."
