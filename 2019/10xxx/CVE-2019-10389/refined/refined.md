Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-10389:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   A missing permission check in a form validation method within the Relution Enterprise Appstore Publisher Plugin.
*   The form validation method does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin's form validation method lacks a check to ensure that only authorized users can perform the connection test.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The absence of a requirement for POST requests allows an attacker to craft a malicious request that exploits the form validation functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials and attacker-specified HTTP proxy configuration. This means the attacker can make the Jenkins server send requests to arbitrary locations.
*   **Credential Disclosure:** The connection test, while not explicitly stated to return the credentials, implies that it's connecting using provided credentials, making the credentials vulnerable to exposure during this process.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker crafts a malicious request targeting the form validation method. This can be done from a different domain or even a different machine.
*   **Browser:** Exploiting the CSRF vulnerability by luring a user to click a malicious link or load a malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have **Overall/Read** permission within the Jenkins instance.
*   The attacker must have knowledge of the Jenkins instance and its exposed endpoints.
*   The attacker needs to be able to induce a user with appropriate permissions to click on a link or browse to a page that makes a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the date of publication.
*   The vulnerability is present in Relution Enterprise Appstore Publisher plugin versions up to and including 1.24.
