Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10339:

**CVE-2019-10339: Improper Authorization in JX Resources Plugin**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The JX Resources Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method used for form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Checks:** A form validation method lacked proper authorization checks.
    *   **Improper Authorization:** Users with Overall/Read access could access functionality that should have required higher privileges.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with Overall/Read access could connect to an attacker-specified Kubernetes server, potentially obtaining information about an attacker-specified namespace.
    *   **Credential Leakage:** Exploitation could lead to the leakage of service account credentials used for the connection to Kubernetes.
    *   **Environment Variable Exposure:** Attackers could obtain the value of any attacker-specified environment variable for the Jenkins master process.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Network-based attacks by leveraging the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft requests to the vulnerable form validation method.

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-10339 identifies an improper authorization vulnerability in the JX Resources Plugin for Jenkins. It allows low-privileged users (Overall/Read) to access sensitive information by connecting to an arbitrary Kubernetes server, potentially leaking credentials and environment variables. This is achieved through a form validation method that lacks permission checks.
