*Dear K-9 Mail team,*

In the scope of academic research in cooperation with Ruhr-Uni Bochum and FH Münster, Germany we discovered a security issue in K-9 Mail when used in combination with PGP (OpenKeychain ): K-9 Mail quotes and includes CSS internal `<style>` elements in email replies. This allows an attacker to abuse K-9 Mail as a signing oracle for arbitrary PGP signed emails.

The attack is outlined as follows:

**Attack scenario**

Digital signatures should guarantee integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of messages. To give an example, Johnny could be a commander-in-chief who takes information security seriously. All his emails are digitally signed, making it hard to impersonate him in order to send forged statements or instructions. The goal of our attacker Eve is to start false-flag warfare. Therefore she needs to obtain a digitally signed "declaration of war" which she can forward to the armed forces.

**General idea**

Eve now sends an email to commander Johnny, in which she hides her malicious content using CSS while a benign text message, such as "What's up Johnny?", is added to be shown by K-9 Mail. Similarly, the benign text can be hidden while showing the malicious content, based on CSS conditional rules which are satisfied only for a third party. If Johnny replies to such a specially-crafted HTML/CSS email, he signs arbitrary covert content along with visible content. This signed message can then be forwarded by Eve to a third party (e.g., the armed forces) where it displays the previously hidden malicious content "I hereby declare war". A simple example email is given below:

```
From: eve@evil.com
To: johnny@good.com
Content-Type: text/html

<style>
/* hide malicious content on mobile devices */
@media (max-device-width: 834px) {
  .covert {visibility: hidden;}
}
/* but show on desktop/large-screen devices */
@media (min-device-width: 835px) {
  * {visibility: hidden;}
  .covert {visibility: visible !important}
}
</style>

What's up Johnny?
<div class="covert" style="visibility: hidden">
I hereby declare war.</div>

```

In this example, different content is shown based on the device's screen resolution. It can be used to obtain a signed email from a mobile device, where a benign message is shown. The reply message instead displays a (signed) declaration of war when shown on a desktop mail client.

**Conditional CSS rules**

The W3C specifies CSS conditional rules (e.g., `@media`) which allow different formatting based on conditions such as screen width or orientation. For example, a different text can be shown whether a mobile phone is hold in portrait or landscape mode or whether the document is displayed on a screen or printed out. But there are lots of other options: for example, mail clients can be fingerprinted based on the `@support` conditional rule or various proprietary conditional statements of certain clients can be applied.

Without going into detail here, in the scope of our research we found conditional CSS to show/hide certain text for virtually every email client that exists.

**CSS blinding options**

We identified seven CSS properties which can be used for covert content attacks as shown below. However, this list is unlikely to be complete because CSS is very complex and offers more possibilities to hide text.

```
display:    none;
visibility: hidden;
opacity:    0;
clip-path:  polygon(0px 0px, 0px 0px, 0px 0px, 0px 0px);
position:   absolute; top: -9999px; left: -9999px;
color:      transparent;
font-size:  0;

```

**Impact**

The attack allows Eve to obtain valid signatures for arbitrary content to be displayed. This can be used to trick a third party, which relies on the authenticity and integrity of signed messages, to perform certain actions (such as starting a war). A forensic analysis can reveal the deception, but then it may already be too late (the war is already declared).

**Countermeasures**

There are three options to counter the attack, each with a usability-security trade-off:

1. *Drop CSS support in general*: Conditional CSS makes it easy for an attacker to hide certain text within a signed message while showing different text. Ideally, clients would ignore CSS in received emails. However, this is an unrealistic scenario given today's usage of email. Sanitizing conditional CSS rules and properties which can be used to hide content is feasible, but it may be insufficient as web technologies are constantly evolving.
2. *Only ASCII text in replies*: It should not harm the user experience if mail clients converted quoted messages into ASCII text when replying to an email. Various clients are already doing this. Thus, we recommend that security-focused clients should adopt this behavior.
3. *Remove CSS styles in replies*: Email clients should not sign any quoted CSS `<style>` (or `<link rel="stylesheet"`) from the original message, so that they cannot be used as signing oracles, based on blinding text with CSS conditional statements.

*Greetings,*

*Jens*
