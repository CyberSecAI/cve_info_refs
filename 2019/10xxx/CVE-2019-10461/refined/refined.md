**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The plugin stored a sensitive credential in plaintext.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins master file system could view the unencrypted credential.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the Jenkins master file system.
- Users with read access to the Jenkins master.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Jenkins master file system
- Overall/Read permission to Jenkins
