Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10414:

**CVE-2019-10414**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Git Changelog Plugin stored MediaWiki and Jira passwords unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Credentials (passwords) were stored in plain text instead of being encrypted.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The stored passwords could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or any user with access to the Jenkins master file system. This could lead to unauthorized access to MediaWiki and Jira accounts.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Attackers could gain access to the unencrypted passwords by having access to the Jenkins master file system or by exploiting other vulnerabilities that grant "Extended Read" permissions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need either "Extended Read" permission within the Jenkins environment or access to the Jenkins master's file system to view the configuration files where the passwords were stored in plain text.
