SECURITY-1100 / CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to
display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis
Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of
each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a
permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the
per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and
POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

SECURITY-930 / CVE-2019-10317
SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for
the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that. Instead, it now has an opt-in option
to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

SECURITY-1252 / CVE-2019-10309
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover
Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser
in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows
unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a
maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary
files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1355 (1) / CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)
Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer
permissions.

SECURITY-1355 (2) / CVE-2019-10312
Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be
used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1390 / CVE-2019-10318
Azure AD Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global config.xml
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Azure AD Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

SECURITY-1143 / CVE-2019-10313
Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file
on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-936 / CVE-2019-10314
Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-443 / CVE-2019-10315
GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to
prevent CSRF. This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided
during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim. If
the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be
attached to the attacker’s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

SECURITY-1380 / CVE-2019-10316
Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

# Overview

The GitHub Authentication plugin provides a means of securing a Jenkins instance by offloading authentication and authorization to GitHub. The plugin authenticates by using a [GitHub OAuth Application](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/). It can use multiple authorization strategies for authorizing users. GitHub users are surfaced as Jenkins users for authorization. GitHub organizations and teams are surfaced as Jenkins groups for authorization. This plugin supports GitHub Enterprise.

## Setup

Before configuring the plugin you must create a GitHub application registration.

1. Visit <https://github.com/settings/applications/new> to create a GitHub application registration.
2. The values for application name, homepage URL, or application description don't matter. They can be customized however desired.
3. However, the authorization callback URL takes a specific value. It must be `https://jenkins.example.com/securityRealm/finishLogin` where jenkins.example.com is the location of the Jenkins server.

   The important part of the callback URL is `/securityRealm/finishLogin`
4. Finish by clicking *Register application*.

The *Client ID* and the *Client Secret* will be used to configure the Jenkins Security Realm. Keep the page open to the application registration so this information can be copied to your Jenkins configuration.

#### Security Realm in Global Security

The security realm in Jenkins controls authentication (i.e. you are who you say you are). The GitHub Authentication Plugin provides a security realm to authenticate Jenkins users via GitHub OAuth.

1. In the Global Security configuration choose the Security Realm to be **GitHub Authentication Plugin**.
2. The settings to configure are: GitHub Web URI, GitHub API URI, Client ID, Client Secret, and OAuth Scope(s).
3. If you're using GitHub Enterprise then the API URI is <https://ghe.example.com/api/v3>.

   The GitHub Enterprise API URI ends with `/api/v3`.
4. The recommended minimum [GitHub OAuth scopes](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes) are `read:org,user:email`.

   The recommended scopes are designed for using both authentication and authorization functions in the plugin. If only authentication is being used then the scope can be further limited to `(no scope)` or `user:email`.

In the plugin configuration pages each field has a little (❓) next to it. Click on it for help about the setting.

#### Authorization in Global Security.

The authorization configuration in Jenkins controls what your users can do (i.e. read jobs, execute builds, administer permissions, etc.). The GitHub OAuth Plugin supports multiple ways of configuring authorization.

It is highly recommended that you configure the security realm and log in via GitHub OAuth before configuring authorization. This way Jenkins can look up and verify users and groups if configuring matrix-based authorization.

##### Github Committer Authorization Strategy

Control user authorization using the **Github Committer Authorization Strategy**. This is the simplest authorization strategy to get up and running. It handles authorization based on the git URL of a job and the type of access a user has to that project (i.e. Admin, Read/Write, Read-Only).

There is a way to authorize the use of the `/github-webhook` callback url to receive post commit hooks from GitHub. This authorization strategy has a checkbox that can allow GitHub POST data to be received. You will still need to run the [GitHub Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/GitHub%2BPlugin) to have the message trigger the build.

##### Logged-in users can do anything

There are a few ways to configure the plugin so that everyone on your team has `Overall/Administer` access.

1. Choose **Logged-in users can do anything** authorization strategy.
2. Choose one of the matrix-based authorization strategies. Set `authenticated` users to `Overall/Administer` permissions. Set `anonymous` users to have `Overall/Read` permissions and perhaps the `ViewStatus` permission.

##### Matrix-based Authorization strategy

Control user authorization using **Matrix-based security** or **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy**. Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy allows one to configure authorization globally per project and, when using Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy with the CloudBees folder plugin, per folder.

There are a few built-in authorizations to consider.

* `anonymous` - is anyone who has not logged in. Recommended permissions are just `Job/Discover` and `Job/ViewStatus`.
* `authenticated` - is anyone who has logged in. You can configure permissions for anybody who has logged into Jenkins. Recommended permissions are `Overall/Read` and `View/Read`.

  `anonymous` and `authenticated` usernames are case sensitive and must be lower case. This is a consideration when configuring authorizations via Groovy. Keep in mind that `anonymous` shows up as *Anonymous* in the Jenkins UI.

You can configure authorization based on GitHub users, organizations, or teams.

* `username` - give permissions to a specific GitHub username.
* `organization` - give permissions to every user that belongs to a specific GitHub organization.
* `organization*team` - give permissions to a specific GitHub team of a GitHub organization. Notice that organization and team are separated by an asterisk (`*`).

## Other usage

#### Calling Jenkins API using GitHub Personal Access Tokens

You can make Jenkins API calls by using a GitHub personal access token. One can still call the Jenkins API by using Jenkins tokens or use the Jenkins CLI with an SSH key for authentication. However, the GitHub OAuth plugin provides another way to call the Jenkins API by allowing the use of a GitHub Personal Access Token.

1. Generate a [GitHub *Personal Access Token*](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and give it only `read:org` scope.
2. Use a username and GitHub personal access token to authenticate with the Jenkins API.

Here's an example using curl to start a build using parameters (username `samrocketman` and password using the personal access token).

```
curl -X POST https://jenkins.example.com/job/_jervis_generator/build --user "samrocketman:myGitHubPersonalAccessToken" --data-urlencode json='{"parameter": [{"name":"project", "value":"samrocketman/jervis"}]}'

```

#### Automatically configure security realm via script console

Configuration management could be used to configure the security realm via the [Jenkins Script Console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BScript%2BConsole). Here's a sample configuring plugin version 0.22.

```
import hudson.security.SecurityRealm
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.GithubSecurityRealm
String githubWebUri = 'https://github.com'
String githubApiUri = 'https://api.github.com'
String clientID = 'someid'
String clientSecret = 'somesecret'
String oauthScopes = 'read:org'
SecurityRealm github_realm = new GithubSecurityRealm(githubWebUri, githubApiUri, clientID, clientSecret, oauthScopes)
//check for equality, no need to modify the runtime if no settings changed
if(!github_realm.equals(Jenkins.instance.getSecurityRealm())) {
    Jenkins.instance.setSecurityRealm(github_realm)
    Jenkins.instance.save()
}

```

#### Automatically configure authorization strategy via script console

Configuration management could be used to configure the authorization strategy via the [Jenkins Script Console](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Jenkins%2BScript%2BConsole). Here's a sample configuring plugin version 0.22.

```
import org.jenkinsci.plugins.GithubAuthorizationStrategy
import hudson.security.AuthorizationStrategy

//permissions are ordered similar to web UI
//Admin User Names
String adminUserNames = 'samrocketman'
//Participant in Organization
String organizationNames = ''
//Use Github repository permissions
boolean useRepositoryPermissions = true
//Grant READ permissions to all Authenticated Users
boolean authenticatedUserReadPermission = false
//Grant CREATE Job permissions to all Authenticated Users
boolean authenticatedUserCreateJobPermission = false
//Grant READ permissions for /github-webhook
boolean allowGithubWebHookPermission = false
//Grant READ permissions for /cc.xml
boolean allowCcTrayPermission = false
//Grant READ permissions for Anonymous Users
boolean allowAnonymousReadPermission = false
//Grant ViewStatus permissions for Anonymous Users
boolean allowAnonymousJobStatusPermission = false

AuthorizationStrategy github_authorization = new GithubAuthorizationStrategy(adminUserNames,
    authenticatedUserReadPermission,
    useRepositoryPermissions,
    authenticatedUserCreateJobPermission,
    organizationNames,
    allowGithubWebHookPermission,
    allowCcTrayPermission,
    allowAnonymousReadPermission,
    allowAnonymousJobStatusPermission)

//check for equality, no need to modify the runtime if no settings changed
if(!github_authorization.equals(Jenkins.instance.getAuthorizationStrategy())) {
    Jenkins.instance.setAuthorizationStrategy(github_authorization)
    Jenkins.instance.save()
}

```

## Troubleshooting Installation

After installing, the `<securityRealm>` class should have been updated in your `/var/lib/jenkins/config.xml` file. The value of `<clientID>` should agree with what you pasted into the admin UI. If it doesn't or you still can't log in, reset to `<securityRealm class="hudson.security.HudsonPrivateSecurityRealm">` and restart Jenkins from the command-line.
