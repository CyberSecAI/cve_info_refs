The provided content relates to CVE-2019-10301.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GitLab Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check on a form validation method.
- Form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request that bypasses the missing permission check and uses an attacker-specified URL and credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
- The attacker needs to have access to an attacker-specified URL and attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method.
