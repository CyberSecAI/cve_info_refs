Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10164:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a stack-based buffer overflow within the PostgreSQL server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The core issue is that the server doesn't properly validate the size of input when setting or changing a user's password, potentially leading to data overwriting other parts of the stack memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Server crash:** A specially crafted password can cause the PostgreSQL server to crash.
- **Arbitrary code execution:** The overflow can be further exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the PostgreSQL operating system account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network connection, enabling remote exploitation.
- **Authenticated user:** An attacker must have valid authentication credentials to connect to the PostgreSQL server and attempt to change the password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the PostgreSQL server.
-   The attacker needs to be able to send database commands to the PostgreSQL server which allows the attacker to change the password.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by an authenticated user through a crafted password change. Exploitation could result in a server crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the PostgreSQL operating system account. It is remotely exploitable, requiring only valid database credentials to trigger the vulnerability.
