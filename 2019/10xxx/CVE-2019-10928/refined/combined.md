WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Protect access to port 22/tcp (using the build-in ﬁrewall for SCALANCE SC-600)

• Protect physical access to the device

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SCALANCE SC ﬁrewall is used to protect trusted industrial networks from untrusted networks. It
allows ﬁltering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways.

SCALANCE X switches are used to connect industrial components like Programmable Logic Controllers
(PLCs) or Human Machine Interfaces (HMIs).

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10927

An authenticated attacker with network access to to port 22/tcp of an affected device may cause a
Denial-of-Service condition.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated attacker with network access to the
affected device. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability impacts
the availability of the affected device.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10928

An authenticated attacker with access to port 22/tcp as well as physical access to an affected device
may trigger the device to allow execution of arbitrary commands.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated attacker with physical access to the
affected device. No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability impacts
the conﬁdentiality, integrity and availability of the affected device.
