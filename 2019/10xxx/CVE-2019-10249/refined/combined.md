| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c0)  Christian Dietrich [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 03:56:25 EDT  ``` Request for a new CVE.  project: Eclipse Xtext & Xtend  version: all version prior to 2.18.0  cwe: CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere cwe: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check  All Xtext & Xtend versions prior to 2.18.0 were built using HTTP instead of HTTPS file transfer and thus the built artifacts may have been compromised. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c1)  Christian Dietrich [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 04:12:39 EDT  ``` Request for a new CVE.  project: Eclipse Xtext & Xtend  version: all versions prior to 2.18.0  cwe: CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere cwe: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check  All Xtext & Xtend versions prior to 2.18.0 were built using HTTP instead of HTTPS file transfer and thus the built artifacts may have been compromised. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c2)  Christian Dietrich [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 07:07:02 EDT  ``` original report was [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code") respectively <https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/759> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c3)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 10:00:39 EDT  ``` Is this a duplicate of [Bug 544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code"), or do we need both?  By way of process, I have not responded to the CVE assignment request on [Bug 544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code") because a project committer has not confirmed the request. If you put [Comment 0](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c0) on [Bug 544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code"), I will take it from there.  As a matter of practice, we assign the CVE only at the request of a committer.   > When all of the information is assembled and the vulnerability  > is ready for disclosure, a project team member must send a  > message to the Security Team with a request to assign a CVE  > Number and send the report to the central authority.  The bug also needs to be marked FIXED and the committers-only flag removed.  There's more here:  <https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability-cve> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c4)  Christian Dietrich [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 10:09:21 EDT  ``` i dont know if this is the name CVE or NOT i created this one because you obviously didt no want everything to be handled in [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code") which is why you told jonas to create public github issues in the first place instead of dealing with the problem in [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code")  > The bug also needs to be marked FIXED and the committers-only flag removed. which bug do you refer to ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c5)  Christian Dietrich [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 10:12:51 EDT  ``` btw <https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/759> is a public issue what the committers only flag is irrelevant. and its closed as fixed ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c6)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 11:08:29 EDT  ``` Okay. I see where this went off the rails. This is certainly related to [Bug 544852](show_bug.cgi?id=544852 "CLOSED MOVED - Releases were & are built/executed/tested/released in the context of insecure/untrusted code"), but it is not the same. That bug concerns the general issue, this one is specific to Xtext. My apologies for being thick-headed. I think that I'm fully caught up.  Per the process, this bug needs to be marked fixed and the committer-only flag removed before I can create the CVE.   Given that this issue has been publicly disclosed via the GitHub Issue, I'll mark it fixed and remove the committer-only flag for disclosure to the central authority. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c7)  Christian Dietrich [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 11:10:22 EDT  ``` +1 ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=546996#c8)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-05-06 11:57:52 EDT  ``` Pull request (to promote to central authority): <https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/pull/2010> ``` |  |

## Description

![@JLLeitschuh](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1323708?u=477b44e744c9d63ec1386f1c728195936b42cbe7&v=4&size=48)[JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh)opened [on Mar 26, 2019](https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-xtend/issues/759#issue-425497425)

[CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html)

[CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/494.html)

The build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Any of these artifacts could have been MITM to maliciously compromise them and infect the build artifacts that were produced. Additionally, if any of these JARs or other dependencies were compromised, any developers using these could continue to be infected past updating to fix this.

This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of 8.1/10

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H>

### This isn't just theoretical

POC code has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file inflight.

See:

* <https://github.com/mveytsman/dilettante>

### MITM Attacks Increasingly Common

### Original Report

<https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=544852>

This was originally responsibly disclosed privately, but I was asked to make it public by [@waynebeaton](https://github.com/waynebeaton).

### Public Disclosure

#### Option 1: File for a CVE

A project maintainer for this project should probably file for a CVE number to inform the public about this vulnerability in the build for this project. The goal is to inform the public that there was a potential for published build artifacts to have been maliciously compromised in earlier releases.

If a maintainer on this project works for or is associated with a CNA, please have them file it with them:

[cve.mitre.org/cve/request\_id.html](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html)

Otherwise, an open source CVE should be filed for here:

[iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)

#### Option 2: Manually validate the release artifacts

If this project's build is [fully reproducible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducible_builds). An alternative to filing for a CVE is to go back and build the earlier releases (with the HTTPS patch applied) to confirm the artifacts were not tampered when they were built. This can be done by comparing the hashes of the artifacts built locally with the ones published. If the hashes of all previous artifacts match those that are published, you can safely assume that the releases were not tampered with.

Again, this assumes that the build if fully reproducible and will require significantly more work.
