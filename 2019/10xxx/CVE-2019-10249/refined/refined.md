CVE-2019-10249
```

- **Root Cause:** Eclipse Xtext & Xtend versions prior to 2.18.0 were built using HTTP instead of HTTPS for file transfers.
- **Vulnerability:** Inclusion of functionality from an untrusted control sphere (CWE-829) and download of code without integrity check (CWE-494). The project was resolving dependencies over HTTP, making it susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Impact:** Build artifacts may have been compromised, potentially infecting developers using these compromised JARs or other dependencies, even after updating to a fixed version.
- **Attack Vector:** MITM attacks to compromise dependencies during the build process.
- **Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to perform MITM attacks on HTTP traffic.
