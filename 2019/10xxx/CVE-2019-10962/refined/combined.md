## 4. MITIGATIONS

BD recommends the following mitigations and compensating controls in order to reduce risk associated with these vulnerabilities.

For the Alaris Gateway Workstation Web Browser User Interface vulnerability:

* BD recommends using the latest firmware, Version 1.3.2 or 1.6.1
* Users should ensure only appropriate associates have access to their network
* Users should isolate their network from untrusted systems

For the Alaris Gateway Workstation Dangerous File Upload vulnerability:

* BD recommends users block the SMB protocol
* Users should segregate their VLAN network
* Users should ensure only appropriate associates have access to the network.

BD is currently assessing additional remediation efforts, including an adjustment to restrict the SMB protocol.

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all medical devices and/or systems.
* Locate medical devices behind firewalls and isolate them where possible.
* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.
* Apply defense-in-depth strategies.
* Disable any unnecessary accounts, protocols and services.
* Where additional information is needed, refer to existing cybersecurity in medical device guidance issued by the FDA at the following location:

<https://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DigitalHealth/ucm373213.htm>

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](/ics/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](/ics/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).
