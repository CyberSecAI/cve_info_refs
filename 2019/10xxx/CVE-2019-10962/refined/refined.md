*   Exploitation could lead to **devices becoming unavailable**.
*   The advisory states that an attacker could achieve **arbitrary code execution**.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker only needs to know the IP address of the Alaris Gateway Workstation to access the web interface.
