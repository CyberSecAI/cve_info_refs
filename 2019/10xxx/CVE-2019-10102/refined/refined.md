Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10102:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the Kotlin plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, which was resolving artifacts using an insecure HTTP connection when creating new projects using the Kotlin IDE template. This means that during the build process, the plugin was downloading project dependencies and resources over an unencrypted connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** By using an unencrypted HTTP connection, an attacker positioned between the user and the server hosting the artifacts could intercept the network traffic.
*   **Lack of Encryption:** The primary vulnerability lies in the absence of encryption (HTTPS) for retrieving project artifacts, leaving the communication vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection/Tampering:** An attacker could modify the downloaded artifacts by injecting malicious code, potentially compromising the user's project.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:** This could lead to a supply chain attack, where malicious code is introduced through a trusted source (in this case, project templates)
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** While not directly stated, it is possible the artifact download may include sensitive information which may be exposed via the MITM attack

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based MITM:** An attacker needs to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the user's machine and the server hosting the Kotlin artifacts. This could be achieved through various means, such as compromising a network router, using a rogue Wi-Fi access point, or through compromised DNS servers.
*   **Project Template:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user creates a new project using the Kotlin IDE template within IntelliJ IDEA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must have the capability to intercept and modify network traffic between the user's machine and the artifact server.
*   **No User Interaction** The vulnerability can be exploited passively if the user uses the vulnerable template.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The JetBrains blog post provides more detail than the initial description of the CVE.
*   The vulnerability was resolved in Kotlin version 1.3.30.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate JetBrains Kotlin, and that versions prior to 1.3.30 are vulnerable to the identified issues.
*   The NetApp advisory also indicates a CVSS v3.1 score of 8.1 (HIGH), with an attack vector of "Network" (AV:N), low complexity (AC:H), no privileges required(PR:N), no user interaction (UI:N), and no scope change (S:U) with high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
