  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "JSON path keys not being properly sanitized in the Postgres dialect.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries by injecting malicious code into JSON path keys.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting a malicious JSON path key in a query using the Sequelize ORM.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the JSON path keys that are part of a query being executed."
  },
  "additional_info": {
    "exploit_maturity": "Proof of concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability is available.",
    "poc": "The provided proof of concept demonstrates how a crafted JSON path key can be used to inject SQL code, allowing an attacker to potentially gain access to sensitive information, and manipulate data. \nExample malicious JSON path key: `{\"a\') = \'1\' UNION SELECT VERSION(); -- \": 1}`"
