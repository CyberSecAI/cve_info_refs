  "CVE-2019-10194": {
    "Description": "Sensitive passwords used in the deployment and configuration of oVirt Metrics were found to be insufficiently protected. Passwords could be disclosed in log files (if playbooks are run with -v), or in playbooks stored on Metrics or Bastion hosts.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Passwords used during the deployment and configuration of oVirt Metrics were not sufficiently protected.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Sensitive passwords stored in plain text in Ansible playbooks.",
      "Sensitive passwords displayed in log files when Ansible playbooks are run with verbose mode (-v)."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Disclosure of sensitive passwords used for oVirt Metrics deployment and configuration.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Reading log files generated during Ansible playbook execution with verbose mode.",
      "Accessing Ansible playbooks stored on Metrics or Bastion hosts."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need access to either the log files or the Ansible playbooks."
