  "CVE-2019-10182": {
    "description": "Icedtea-web did not properly sanitize paths from <jar/> elements in JNLP files. An attacker could trick a victim into running a specially crafted application and use this flaw to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations in the context of the user.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "1.7.2 and below",
      "1.8.2 and below"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient path sanitization in the processing of the `href` attribute of `<jar/>` elements within JNLP files. Specifically, the application does not properly handle relative path components like `..` (dot-dot) which allow path traversal.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Path traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file overwrite leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. The attacker can host a malicious JNLP file on a remote server and trick a victim into running it.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious JNLP file and trick the user into executing it using icedtea-web.",
