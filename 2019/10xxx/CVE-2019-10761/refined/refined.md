{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the ability to trigger a RangeError exception from the host environment by reaching the stack call limit with an infinite recursion within the sandboxed context. This bypasses the intended sandboxing mechanism.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sandboxing",
      "Improper exception handling"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the host machine by exploiting the vulnerability. This is accomplished by obtaining a reference to the host's `mainModule`, which allows spawning a child process and executing arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Execution of untrusted code within the vm2 sandbox",
       "Infinite recursion to trigger a host RangeError"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to provide untrusted code that is executed within the vm2 sandbox and crafted to trigger the vulnerability. No special privileges are required."
