- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary code execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.
- Attack vector: By exploiting the custom list of pre-approved signatures for scripts, attackers can bypass the Script Security sandbox protection.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have the ability to run scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.
