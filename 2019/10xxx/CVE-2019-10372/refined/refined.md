## CVE-2019-10372

**Description:**

The GitLab Authentication Plugin for Jenkins records the HTTP Referer header when the authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL after login. This behavior leads to an open redirect vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**

The plugin uses the HTTP Referer header to redirect users after login without proper validation.

**Weakness:**

Open redirect vulnerability.

**Impact:**

Malicious sites can exploit this by implementing a phishing attack. Users are redirected to a malicious site after logging in, potentially leading them to believe they are still on the legitimate Jenkins site. This could trick users into entering sensitive information or performing actions that compromise their security.

**Attack Vector:**

An attacker crafts a malicious link that redirects the user to the Jenkins login page. After successful authentication, the plugin redirects the user to the URL specified in the Referer header, which is controlled by the attacker.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**

The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious link and lure the user to click on it. No specific privileges are required on the Jenkins instance itself.

**Affected Versions:**

GitLab Authentication Plugin versions up to and including 1.4 are affected.
