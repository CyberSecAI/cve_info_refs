The provided content relates to **CVE-2019-10114**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of a non-constant time comparison operator (`==`) when verifying the HMAC during the OAuth authentication process. Specifically, the comparison is performed in `ee/lib/gitlab/geo/oauth/login_state.rb`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Timing Attack:** The non-constant time comparison allows an attacker to infer information about the correct HMAC by observing the time it takes for the comparison to return a result.
- **Information Exposure:** The time discrepancy during comparison can be exploited to guess the correct HMAC.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Redirect to attacker-controlled URL:** An attacker can use this issue to guess the correct HMAC for an arbitrary URL, forwarding the user to a malicious site under the attacker's control.
- **OAuth Bypass:** Successful exploitation could potentially lead to unauthorized access or session hijacking.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attack is performed by sending multiple requests with crafted HMAC values, observing the response time to infer the correct value.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable GitLab instance.
- **Ability to send crafted requests:** The attacker needs to have the ability to craft requests with different HMAC values and observe the response times.
- **Knowledge of the OAuth flow:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the OAuth authentication process works to be able to construct the requests.
