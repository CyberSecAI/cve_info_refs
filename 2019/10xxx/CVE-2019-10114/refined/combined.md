# 2019 Q1 Recurity Assessment: Information Exposure Through Timing Discrepancy

<https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/engineering/issues/329>

# Details

During the OAuth authentication process, the application attempts to validate a parameter in an insecure way, potentially exposing data. As can be seen in the following code of `ee/lib/gitlab/geo/oauth/login_state.rb`, the non-constant time comparison operator == is used to verify the validity of the provided HMAC.

```
def valid?
  return false unless salt.present? & hmac.present?
  hmac == generate_hmac
end
```

Due to the way how this operator works, the comparison `"xecret" == "secret`" is resolved significantly faster than `"secrex" == "secret"`.[Ref](http://www.eggie5.com/45-hmac-timing-attacks)

Since the HMAC contains the parameter `redirect_to`, this issue could be used to guess the correct hash for an arbitrary URL of the attacker's choice, forwarding the user to an attacker-controlled URL.
However, it should be noted that the amount of effort required to exploit this issue is disproportionately high compared to its impact.

# Reproduction Steps

Observe the code at `ee/lib/gitlab/geo/oauth/login_state.rb`.

# Recommendation

Recurity Labs recommends choosing a constant-time comparison, such as
`secure_compare` from Rails `ActiveSupport` [module](https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.0/classes/ActiveSupport/SecurityUtils.html)
