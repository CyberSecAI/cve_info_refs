Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10407:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Project Inheritance Plugin displayed secret environment variables, which were defined using the Mask Passwords Plugin, without masking them. This occurred in the "Full Build Flow" view and during metadata downloads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The plugin failed to properly mask secret environment variables, leading to their exposure.
*   **Inadequate Data Handling:** The plugin didn't handle secret data securely when displaying it or including it in metadata.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Secrets:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive information like passwords or API keys that were supposed to be protected by the Mask Passwords Plugin.
*   **Potential for Lateral Movement:** Exposed secrets could enable further attacks, like accessing external systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access:** An attacker could directly view the secret variables through the "Full Build Flow" view.
*   **Metadata Download:** The attacker could obtain the secret variables by downloading the project metadata.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privilege:** An attacker with the ability to view build details would be able to exploit this issue to gain access to the secrets. The specific permission is not mentioned, other than 'user'.
*   **Access to Jenkins Instance:** The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins instance where the vulnerable plugin is installed and where secret environment variables are configured.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Project Inheritance Plugin is the affected component.
*   The Mask Passwords Plugin is used to define the secret values, but it is not vulnerable on its own.
*   The issue was resolved by ensuring the Project Inheritance Plugin no longer displays or includes unmasked secret variables.
