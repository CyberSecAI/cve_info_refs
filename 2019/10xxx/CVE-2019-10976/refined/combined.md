ICS Advisory
# Mitsubishi Electric FR Configurator2

Last RevisedJuly 23, 2019
Alert CodeICSA-19-204-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 7.1**
* ATTENTION: Low skill level to exploit
* Vendor: Mitsubishi Electric
* Equipment: Mitsubishi Electric FR Configurator2
* Vulnerabilities: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may enable arbitrary files to be read or cause a denial-of-service condition.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Mitsubishi FR Configurator2, used for configuring Mitsubishi variable frequency drives, are affected:

* FR Configurator2 Version 1.16S and prior

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF XML EXTERNAL ENTITY REFERENCE CWE-611](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html)

#### This vulnerability is triggered when input passed to the XML parser is not sanitized while parsing the XML project and/or template file (.frc2). Once a user opens the file, the attacker could read arbitrary files.

[CVE-2019-10976](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10976) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.1 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [UNCONTROLLED RESOURCE CONSUMPTION CWE-400](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/400.html)

#### This vulnerability can be triggered when an attacker provides the target with a rogue project file (.frc2). Once a user opens the rogue project, CPU exhaustion occurs, which causes the software to quit responding until the application is restarted.

[CVE-2019-10972](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10972) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Japan
