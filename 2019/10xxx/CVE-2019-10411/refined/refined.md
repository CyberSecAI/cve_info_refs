Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10411:

**CVE-2019-10411**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Inedo BuildMaster Plugin for Jenkins
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin stores the service password in its global Jenkins configuration. While the password is encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Exposure of sensitive information due to insecure handling of credentials in the configuration form.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The password could be exposed through browser extensions, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, or similar situations, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the BuildMaster service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** An attacker intercepting network traffic when the configuration form is loaded could capture the plaintext password.
    *  **Browser Extensions/Malware:** Malicious browser extensions or malware could potentially access and steal the password.
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting:** If an attacker can execute XSS on the Jenkins instance, they could potentially steal the password from the configuration form.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *  No specific attacker position is required.
    * The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic of an administrator configuring the plugin, have malware/extension access or execute a successful XSS attack on the Jenkins instance.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present because the password is sent in plaintext when the configuration page is loaded, despite being stored encrypted.
*   The fix involves encrypting the password when it's transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.
