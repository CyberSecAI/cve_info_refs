  "CVE-2019-10152": {
    "description": "A path traversal vulnerability has been discovered in podman before version 1.4.0 in the way it handles symlinks inside containers. An attacker who has compromised an existing container can cause arbitrary files on the host filesystem to be read/written when an administrator tries to copy a file from/to the container.",
    "root_cause": "Improper symlink resolution during `podman cp` operations. When a symlink exists within the container's file path being copied, it's resolved on the host system instead of within the container's context.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary read and write access to the host filesystem with root privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Compromised container",
       "podman cp command"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to have compromised an existing container and an administrator must execute `podman cp` command targeting the compromised container."
