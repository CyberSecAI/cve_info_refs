Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `devcert-sanscache` package is vulnerable to command injection because it uses user-controlled input (the `commonName` variable) directly in an `exec` function without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `exec` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High Confidentiality Impact:** The attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information on the system by executing malicious commands.
- **No Integrity Impact:** The vulnerability does not directly modify or corrupt data.
- **No Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not directly cause a denial of service.
- The attacker can achieve arbitrary command execution on the system running the vulnerable code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by providing malicious input to the `commonName` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `commonName` variable that is passed to the vulnerable function.
- The attacker does not need any prior access to the vulnerable system.
- The attack can be performed remotely over the network.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of `devcert-sanscache` prior to 0.4.7.
- Snyk's CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High), while NVD gives a critical score of 9.8.
- A proof of concept (PoC) is provided demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability, which injects the command `touch Song` to create a file named 'Song'.
