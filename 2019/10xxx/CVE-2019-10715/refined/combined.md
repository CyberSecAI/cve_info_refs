# CVE-2019-10715: Stored XSS in Verodin Director version 3.5.3.0 and earlier

![Writer's picture: Nolan B. Kennedy]()Nolan B. KennedyApr 2, 20191 min read
###

### **Overview**

###

This advisory addresses a Stored XSS vulnerability in Verodin Director affecting version 3.5.3.0 and earlier via input fields of certain tooltips, and on the Tags, Sequences, and Actors pages.

This issue was reported to and resolved by Verodin in accordance with responsible disclosure guidelines. The vulnerability was originally disclosed in the Verodin product release notes for version 3.5.4.0 (see section "Defects Resolved, Security").

### **Vulnerability Information**

###

### **Definitions**

**CVE**
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures is a dictionary of common names (CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security vulnerabilities maintained by the MITRE Corporation.

**CVSS**
Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a vendor agnostic, industry open standard designed to convey the severity of a vulnerability. CVSS scores may be used to determine the urgency for update deployment within an organization and can range from 0.0 (no vulnerability) to 10.0 (critical). Customers performing their own risk assessments of vulnerabilities that may impact them can benefit from using the same industry-recognized CVSS metrics.

**Mitigations**
Mitigations are existing conditions that a potential attacker would need to overcome to mount a successful attack or that would limit the severity of an attack. Examples of such conditions include default settings, common configurations and general best practices.

**Workarounds**
Workarounds are settings or configuration changes that a user or administrator can apply to help protect against an attack.

### **Acknowledgements**

# CVE-2019-10715: Stored XSS in Verodin Director version 3.5.3.0 and earlier

![Writer's picture: Nolan B. Kennedy]()Nolan B. KennedyApr 2, 20191 min read
###

### **Overview**

###

This advisory addresses a Stored XSS vulnerability in Verodin Director affecting version 3.5.3.0 and earlier via input fields of certain tooltips, and on the Tags, Sequences, and Actors pages.

This issue was reported to and resolved by Verodin in accordance with responsible disclosure guidelines. The vulnerability was originally disclosed in the Verodin product release notes for version 3.5.4.0 (see section "Defects Resolved, Security").

### **Vulnerability Information**

###

### **Definitions**

**CVE**
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures is a dictionary of common names (CVE Identifiers) for publicly known information security vulnerabilities maintained by the MITRE Corporation.

**CVSS**
Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a vendor agnostic, industry open standard designed to convey the severity of a vulnerability. CVSS scores may be used to determine the urgency for update deployment within an organization and can range from 0.0 (no vulnerability) to 10.0 (critical). Customers performing their own risk assessments of vulnerabilities that may impact them can benefit from using the same industry-recognized CVSS metrics.

**Mitigations**
Mitigations are existing conditions that a potential attacker would need to overcome to mount a successful attack or that would limit the severity of an attack. Examples of such conditions include default settings, common configurations and general best practices.

**Workarounds**
Workarounds are settings or configuration changes that a user or administrator can apply to help protect against an attack.

# CVE-2019-19616: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in Xtivia Web Time and Expense (WebTE)

![Writer's picture: Nolan B. Kennedy]()Nolan B. KennedyDec 3, 20191 min read

Updated: Jan 14, 2020

###

### **Overview**

###

This advisory addresses a Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the Xtivia Web Time and Expense (WebTE) interface used for Microsoft Dynamics NAV before 2017 allows an attacker to download arbitrary expense and requisition reports by specifying arbitrary values for the "recId" and "filename" parameters of the "/Home/GetAttachment" function.

This issue was reported to Xtivia in accordance with responsible disclosure guidelines. Xtivia responded that no patch will be released as the WebTE interface used for Microsoft Dynamics NAV versions prior to 2017 have been deprecated. See screenshot of vendor email response below:

Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a vendor agnostic, industry open standard designed to convey the severity of a vulnerability. CVSS scores may be used to determine the urgency for update deployment within an organization and can range from 0.0 (no vulnerability) to 10.0 (critical). Customers performing their own risk assessments of vulnerabilities that may impact them can benefit from using the same industry-recognized CVSS metrics.

**Mitigations**
Mitigations are existing conditions that a potential attacker would need to overcome to mount a successful attack or that would limit the severity of an attack. Examples of such conditions include default settings, common configurations and general best practices.

**Workarounds**
Workarounds are settings or configuration changes that a user or administrator can apply to help protect against an attack.

### **Acknowledgements**

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Nolan B. Kennedy of MindPoint Group. (See email screenshot at top of page in Overview section).
