Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-10395:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Build Environment Plugin did not properly escape the values of environment variables when displaying them on its views.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of output escaping allowed attackers to inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users viewing the affected pages. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement
    *   Other malicious actions within the Jenkins application

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious code into environment variables of a Jenkins build job.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to control the values of build environment variables. This typically means they need either "Job/Configure" or "Job/Build" permissions within Jenkins.
*   The attacker needs to get a user to view the page where the unescaped environment variables are being displayed.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered a "Stored XSS" vulnerability, since the malicious script is stored within the environment variable data.
*   The fix involves implementing proper output escaping of environment variables within the Build Environment Plugin to prevent XSS attacks.
*   Jenkins versions 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2 and later already apply the missing escaping by default, and therefore, are not affected by this vulnerability.
