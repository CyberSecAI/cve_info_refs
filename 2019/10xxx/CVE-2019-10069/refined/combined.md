**Note that var decoding is still allowed for `StreamPeer.get_var`**.

I think we need to add an `object_decoding` property to `StreamPeer` too (which could be probably cherry picked to `3.0`.).

`2.1` is not affected by any of this as object decoding is not implemented.

I'm also making a separate branch to fix in `3.0` (as the bug is there, but everything related to High Level multiplayer is in SceneTree so cherry picking is not an option).

Fixes [#27395](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/27395) .

I'm also wondering, if we should change the defaults for `decode_variant` and `encode_variant` to be safe (no object decoding), and update all their usage where we want object encoding/decoding with the extra parameter to true.

Sorry, something went wrong.

That sounds good to me.  I'm also wondering, if we should change the defaults for decode\_variant and encode\_variant to be safe (no object decoding), and update all their usage where we want object encoding/decoding with the extra parameter to true.  I agree, it's better that the defaults are safe. We can't expect people to read the documentation to ensure that their use of these APIs is safe, so it's better that they have to read them to find out how to use the unsafe behaviour when needed :)  It's a slight compat breakage but that's justified for security purposes IMO. |
