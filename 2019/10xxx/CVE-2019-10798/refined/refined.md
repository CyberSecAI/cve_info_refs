Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10798

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `rdf.Graph.prototype.add` method in the `rdf-graph-array` library. This method can be manipulated to add or modify properties of `Object.prototype` through a malicious prototype payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** The core vulnerability is prototype pollution. By providing a crafted input, an attacker can modify properties of the `Object.prototype`. This can have wide-ranging effects on the application due to how JavaScript's prototype inheritance works.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** As described in the provided text, prototype pollution can lead to denial of service by modifying critical properties of `Object.prototype`, potentially causing the application to crash or behave unpredictably.

*   **Code Modification:** In general, prototype pollution could also allow for the modification of built-in JavaScript functions, potentially leading to code execution. However, the specific example focuses on the DoS impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector involves using the `rdf.Graph.prototype.add` method.
*   A malicious payload is passed to the `add` method with properties designed to target `Object.prototype`.
*   The proof of concept shows the injection of a `toString` property in the object prototype, demonstrating how such an attack can be carried out

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker needs to be able to pass arbitrary data into a program that uses the vulnerable `rdf-graph-array` library and specifically the `add` method of the `Graph` object. 
*   The attacker doesn't need any privileges on the server.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided Snyk content includes a proof of concept (PoC) that demonstrates how an attacker can pollute the prototype by adding a `toString` property.
*   The `rdf-graph-array` package is no longer maintained.
*   The Snyk page provides a CVSS score and also links to the CWE entry for prototype pollution (CWE-1321).
*   The explanation about ReDos is not directly relevant to the vulnerability, and may be an inclusion of generic security information by Snyk.

In summary, CVE-2019-10798 is a prototype pollution vulnerability in the `rdf-graph-array` package that allows an attacker to modify properties of `Object.prototype` through the `add` method, which could lead to denial of service and other potential security impacts.
