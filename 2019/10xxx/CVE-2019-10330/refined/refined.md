Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-10330:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Gitea Plugin for Jenkins did not properly handle pull requests from untrusted sources in multibranch pipeline configurations. It failed to distinguish between trusted committers and untrusted users when determining which Jenkinsfile to use.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The plugin didn't validate whether a pull request came from a trusted committer before applying changes from the pull request's Jenkinsfile.
*   **Missing Trust Boundary:** The plugin incorrectly treated untrusted pull requests as if they were from trusted sources, leading to potential security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers without commit access to a Git repository could propose changes to a Jenkinsfile via a pull request. This malicious Jenkinsfile could then be used to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins server when the pull request is built.
*   **Compromised Builds**: Attackers could alter the build process, inject malicious code, or change the build output.
*   **Data Breaches**: Through the ability to execute arbitrary code attackers may gain access to sensitive data used in the build process

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Pull Request:** An attacker creates a pull request with a modified Jenkinsfile containing malicious code.
*   **Targeting Multibranch Pipelines:** The attack targets Jenkins instances that use multibranch pipelines and the Gitea plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Commit Access:** The attacker does not need write access or to be a committer on the targeted Git repository.
*   **Ability to Create Pull Request:** The attacker needs to be able to create a pull request against the targeted repository.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability specifically impacts multi-branch pipeline configurations, where typically only committers can propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
*   The fix ensures that only the Jenkinsfile from the target branch is used for pull requests created by untrusted users.
*   The Gitea plugin versions up to and including 1.1.1 are affected by this vulnerability.
*   Version 1.1.2 of the Gitea plugin contains the fix.
