plugins:

* Artifactory Plugin

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-05-31/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1373 / CVE-2019-10325
Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings
parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included
HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings
parser names.

SECURITY-1391 / CVE-2019-10326
Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross-
site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning
counts for future builds.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent
via POST.

SECURITY-1409 / CVE-2019-10327
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a
way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary
directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have
Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities
for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request
forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External
Entities in XML documents.

SECURITY-921 / CVE-2019-10328
Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as
Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary
methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.

SECURITY-1403 / CVE-2019-10329
InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

SECURITY-1046 / CVE-2019-10330
Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to
the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not
be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit
access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to
Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the
configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull
request content when those are trusted.

SECURITY-1015 (1) / CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (permission check)
Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1015 (2) / CVE-2019-10323
Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1347 / CVE-2019-10324
Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to
trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

# Gitea

How to install

* [Documentation](/gitea/)
* [Releases](/gitea/releases/)
* [Issues](/gitea/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/gitea/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/gitea/healthscore/)

# Gitea Plugin documentation

> ℹ️ Gitea plugin depends on the `multibranch pipeline` plugin.

## Initial Setup

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins -> Configure System** and scroll down to **Gitea Servers**
2. Add a new server by name and URL, your URL field should be an accessible location of your Gitea instance via HTTP(s)
3. Optionally enable the "manage hooks" checkbox, this will allow Jenkins to configure your webhooks using an account of your choosing.
   * It is recommended to use a personal access token, you can do this by selecting "Add" next to the credentials dropdown and changing it's "Kind" to **Gitea Personal Access Token** and "Scope" to **System**.

> ℹ️ Hint: you can ignore a "HTTP 403/Forbidden" error here in case your Gitea instance is private.

## Setup Gitea user

1. login to your Gitea instance with an administrator account (optional, you can also register a new user).
2. create a new user, e.g. "jenkins". Set password to something secure - you will not need it for login.
3. add the jenkins user to the organization you want to build projects for in jenkins (either by adding him to an existing team or adding a new "ci"-team). Make sure that team is associated to the repositories you want to build.
4. log out of Gitea.
5. log back in as the new "jenkins" user.
6. in user profile settings, go to "application" and add a new access token. Make sure to note the token shown.

> ℹ️ Hint: As of [Gitea version 1.16.9](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/releases/tag/v1.16.9) the user requires **Write permissions** to repository code. Otherwise, status checks cannot be submitted anymore causing "HTTP 403/Forbidden" errors during builds.

## Map your Gitea organization/user

### Create an item inside Jenkins

1. In main menu, click "New Item"

**Using `branch-api` plugin version <2.7.0**

2. Select "Gitea organization" as the item type

**Using `branch-api` plugin version >=2.7.0**

2. Select "Organization Folder" as the item type

### Configure the item

1. When configuring the new item, select "Repository Sources"

ℹ️ **This is only necessary when using `branch-api` plugin version >=2.7.0**

2. In the "Gitea organzations" section, add a new credential of type "Gitea personal access token".
3. Add the access token created before for the jenkins user in Gitea. Ignore the error about the token not having the correct length.
4. In the "Owner" field, add the name of the organization in Gitea you want to build projects for (**not** the full name).
5. Fill the rest of the form as required. Click "Save". The following scan should list the repositories that the jenkins user can see in the organization selected.
