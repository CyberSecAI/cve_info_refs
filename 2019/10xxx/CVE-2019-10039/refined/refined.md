The content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication when accessing the `/goform/setSysAdm` API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass: The API endpoint `/goform/setSysAdm` does not require authentication, allowing unauthorized access.
- Insecure Direct Object Reference: The lack of authentication allows direct manipulation of system and web account settings.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can modify the web and system account usernames and passwords.
- Full control of the router is possible, allowing for a wide range of malicious activities such as:
    - DNS hijacking
    - Traffic manipulation
    - Firmware modification
    - Network access to internal network

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setSysAdm` endpoint with modified account data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable D-Link router's web interface.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the router.
