SSA-899560: Vulnerabilities in SIPROTEC 5 relays and DIGSI 5

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5

SUMMARY

The SIPROTEC 5 relays and their corresponding engineering software DIGSI 5 are affected by two
security vulnerabilities which could allow an attacker to upload or download ﬁles to the device or to conduct
a Denial-of-Service attack over the network. Siemens has released updates for some affected products,
is working on updates for the remaining affected products, and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures
until ﬁxes are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Block access to port 443/TCP e.g. with an external ﬁrewall.

• Activate role based access control (RBAC) in the device (supported in SIPROTEC 5 ﬁrmware

versions V7.80 and higher)

• Activate the DIGSI 5 connection password in the device (supported in all SIPROTEC 5 ﬁrmware

versions)

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

DIGSI 5 is the engineering and operating software for SIPROTEC 5 protection devices.

SIPROTEC 5 devices provide a range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation
functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

SSA-899560

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10930

A remote attacker could use specially crafted packets sent to port 443/TCP to upload, download or
