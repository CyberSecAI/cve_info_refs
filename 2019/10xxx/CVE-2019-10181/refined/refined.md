  "CVE-2019-10181": {
    "description": "It was found that in icedtea-web up to and including 1.7.2 and 1.8.2 executable code could be injected in a JAR file without compromising the signature verification. An attacker could use this flaw to inject code in a trusted JAR. The code would be executed inside the sandbox.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way IcedTea-Web verifies signatures of JAR files. It doesn't properly check the signature of every file inside the META-INF directory, allowing an attacker to inject unsigned code that would be executed.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper signature validation",
        "Code injection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code within the Java sandbox by placing unsigned class files inside META-INF directory of a signed JAR file. The injected code will be executed with the same privileges as the signed code, inside of the sandbox.",

        "Man-in-the-middle attacks",
        "Compromised hosts with write access to JNLP/JAR files"

  "CVE-2019-10182": {
    "description": "It was found that icedtea-web though 1.7.2 and 1.8.2 did not properly sanitize paths from <jar/> elements in JNLP files. An attacker could trick a victim into running a specially crafted application and use this flaw to upload arbitrary files to arbitrary locations in the context of the user.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
       "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of paths in the 'href' attribute of the <jar/> element in JNLP files, leading to directory traversal.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Path traversal vulnerability",
        "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary file overwrite by using directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) in the JAR href attribute. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if a carefully crafted file is placed in a location that the user's system executes (e.g. startup folder).",

        "Man-in-the-middle attacks",
        "Compromised hosts with write access to JNLP files",

      ],
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to either perform a man-in-the-middle attack or have write permissions on a server hosting the JNLP file, and convince a user to execute it. The file overwrite is possible on Windows systems because Windows normalizes paths."

   "CVE-2019-10185": {
    "description": "It was found that icedtea-web up to and including 1.7.2 and 1.8.2 was vulnerable to a zip-slip attack during auto-extraction of a JAR file. An attacker could use this flaw to write files to arbitrary locations. This could also be used to replace the main running application and, possibly, break out of the sandbox.",
       "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by insufficient sanitization of paths during auto-extraction of nested JAR files inside the main JAR file, leading to directory traversal",

          "Path traversal vulnerability",
          "Improper input validation"
         ],
      "impact": "An attacker can use directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) within zip entries to write files outside the designated extraction directory. This can allow overwriting application files or executing arbitrary code by overwriting a startup file. It could potentially lead to a sandbox escape.",
