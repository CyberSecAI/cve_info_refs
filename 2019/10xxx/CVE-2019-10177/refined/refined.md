{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PDF export component in CloudForms was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) because user input was not properly sanitized.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored XSS vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute malicious code and extract the anti-CSRF token of higher privileged users.",
  "Attack vectors": "By injecting malicious scripts into user input fields, which are then embedded in PDF exports.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be authenticated and have privileges to edit compute in CloudForms."
