# SICK MSC800

Last RevisedJune 27, 2019
Alert CodeICSA-19-178-04

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** SICK
* **Equipment:** MSC800
* **Vulnerability:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a low-skilled remote attacker to reconfigure settings and/or disrupt the functionality of the device.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of MSC800, a programmable logic controller, are affected:

* MSC800 all versions prior to Version 4.0

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

The affected firmware versions contain a hard-coded customer account password.

[CVE-2019-10979](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10979) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Germany

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Tri Quach of Amazon’s Customer Fulfillment Technology Security (CFTS) group reported this vulnerability to NCCIC.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

SICK recommends affected users upgrade to the latest firmware version (v4.0).

The patch and installation procedure for the firmware update is available from the responsible SICK representative. Until the firmware update is installed, general security practices should be utilized.

In case the referenced patches cannot be applied, the following general security practices could mitigate the associated risk.

For more information SICK has released a security notification that can be found at: <https://www.sick.com/de/en/service-and-support/the-sick-product-security-incident-response-team-sick-psirt/w/psirt/#advisories>

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Blocking/Monitoring Ports TCP/2111 or TCP/2112
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.

# SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT)

[SICK Security Advisories](/de/en/w/psirt#advisories)

SICK AG products and services are subject to the highest quality requirements. That is why cyber security is taken into account and tested in the development phase. To ensure that products and services are secure throughout their entire service life, reports on possible vulnerabilities are taken very seriously and handled with the greatest sense of responsibility. Uncovering vulnerabilities is understood as a common goal of different parties with the aim of offering our customers a consistently high level of security.

![](https://cdn.sick.com/media/content/he5/h20/9665608056862.jpg)

![](https://cdn.sick.com/media/content/he5/h20/9665608056862.jpg)

### The SICK Product Security Incident Response Team (SICK PSIRT)

The SICK PSIRT is the central team of SICK AG which is authorized to answer reports regarding the cyber security of products, solutions and services as well as provide information. All reports concerning potential vulnerabilities or other security incidents connected to SICK AG products can be passed on to the SICK PSIRT.

The SICK PSIRT manages the inspection, internal coordination and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. A security advisory is issued for confirmed vulnerabilities as soon as a solution is available. If the situation requires, a security advisory with the measures to be taken is sent out before an update is available.

Reports on potential vulnerabilities or other incidents are more than welcome from anyone, regardless of their customer status. SICK AG respects and takes into account the different interests of reporters and encourages the reporting of information to the SICK PSIRT. The aim is to follow a process of coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities (coordinated vulnerability disclosure).

Handling vulnerabilities is described in document “[Vulnerability Handling Guideline](https://cdn.sick.com/media/content/hc8/h9b/9649321148446.pdf)”.

### Reporting a vulnerability

The SICK PSIRT aims to process every vulnerability with confidentiality and professionalism together with the respective reporters. Neither a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) nor another type of contract is necessary or a requirement for collaboration.

Coordinated vulnerability reports from all members of the security community are greatly appreciated. These include security researchers, universities, CERTs, business partners, authorities, industry associations and suppliers.

Many SICK AG products fulfill important protective functions and are used in critical infrastructures. SICK AG therefore asks for cooperation when dealing with the coordinated disclosure of vulnerabilities and also requests that vulnerability information not be disclosed prematurely.

SICK AG requests that as much information as possible is provided in a report in order to speed up processing. This information should contain the following:

* **Contact information and availability**
* **Affected product including model and version number**
* **Classification of the vulnerability** (buffer overflow, XSS, …)
* **Detailed description of the vulnerability** (with verification if possible)
* **Effect of the vulnerability** (if know)
* **Current level of awareness of the vulnerability** (are there plans to disclose it?)
* **(Company) affiliation of the reporter** (if reporter is prepared to provide such information)
* **CVSS score** (if known)

If more information is necessary for the inspection of a vulnerability, the SICK PSIRT will contact the reporter.

If the reporter would like, he/she will be publicly acknowledged after disclosing a new vulnerability.

### Contact information

Reports for the SICK PSIRT are to be sent to this address:

* psirt@sick.de
  ([PGP Public Key](/medias/7F833F8E676ED0BA.pub.asc?context=bWFzdGVyfGNvbnRlbnR8MTI1MzZ8dGV4dC9wbGFpbnxjb250ZW50L2g1Yi9oNTUvMTQwNjExNDI1NDAzMTgudHh0fDZlOTc4MGUxNDg1N2RjZDc5OTdhZGRiNGM2MTRhMWU5MzRmMTEzYjA5NDYzM2ZkOWI1NjJlMTcwMGJiODRmMzY) with fingerprint: 7F26 510F D9D7 3F4E 17DE A093 7F83 3F8E)
* Accepted languages: German and English
* Transmission: Encryption preferred

Encrypted reports are preferred to protect sensitive information and data. German and English are accepted.

The SICK PSIRT is happy to provide additional information about its operating principle or answer general questions about reports of vulnerabilities. If you have any other questions or concerns not related to security, we ask that you contact SICK AG customer service. The SICK PSIRT cannot provide in
