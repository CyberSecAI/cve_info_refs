Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the affected firmware versions of the SICK MSC800 programmable logic controller. Specifically, a hard-coded customer account password exists within the firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The firmware contains a password that is not randomly generated or configurable, but rather is built into the software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit allows a remote attacker with low skill to:
    *   Reconfigure device settings
    *   Disrupt the functionality of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is remote, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability over a network.
*   The required skill level for exploitation is low.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
*   No specific prior authentication or privileged access is needed since the vulnerability is based on the presence of hard-coded credentials that can be used for login.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects MSC800 devices running versions prior to v4.0.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8, indicating critical severity.
*   The affected sector is Critical Manufacturing, and the devices are deployed worldwide.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Tri Quach of Amazonâ€™s Customer Fulfillment Technology Security (CFTS) group.
*   Mitigation involves upgrading the firmware to v4.0. General security practices are recommended in the interim.
*   The advisory suggests minimizing network exposure of control system devices, placing them behind firewalls, using secure remote access methods like VPNs, and blocking/monitoring ports TCP/2111 or TCP/2112.
