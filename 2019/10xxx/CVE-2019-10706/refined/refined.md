[CVE-2019-10706]
Root cause: The firmware update authentication method for affected devices relies on a symmetric HMAC digest. The key used to validate this digest is present in a protected area of the device.
Vulnerability: If the key is extracted, it could be used to install arbitrary firmware to other devices.
Affected products: SanDisk X300, X300s, and X400 SATA SED SSD devices and SanDisk X600 SATA SED SSD (except model numbers SD9TB8W-XXXX-1006 and SD9TN8W-XXXX-1006)
