Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10641:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that existing user sessions are not invalidated when a user changes their password, either in the backend or frontend of the Contao CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Inadequate session management: The system fails to properly invalidate existing user sessions upon a password change, which is a critical security flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Session Hijacking: If an attacker has a valid session for a user and that user subsequently changes their password, the attacker's session remains valid. This allows the attacker to maintain unauthorized access to the user's account even after the password has been changed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs a valid user session on a vulnerable Contao instance.
- The legitimate user then changes their password, but the attacker's session remains active.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have already obtained a valid session token (e.g., through prior successful exploitation, session theft, or any other means)
- The attacker does not need to be present when the legitimate user changes their password. The vulnerability exists in the session management logic.

**Affected Versions:**
The following Contao versions are affected:
- Contao 3.* up to 3.5.38
- Contao 4.0
- Contao 4.1
- Contao 4.2
- Contao 4.3
- Contao 4.4 up to 4.4.36
- Contao 4.5
- Contao 4.6
- Contao 4.7 up to 4.7.2

**Patched Versions:**
The vulnerability is fixed in:
- Contao 3.5.39
- Contao 4.4.37
- Contao 4.7.3
