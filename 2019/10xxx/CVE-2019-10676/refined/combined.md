CVE-2019-10676

```
> ```
>
>
> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>
> When entering new credentials to a site that isn't registered within
> the password manager, a pop-up window will appear asking the user
> if they want to save these new credentials. This pop-up window will
> stay on any page the user visits within the browser until a
> decision is made. The code of the pop-up window can be read by remote
> servers and contains the login credentials and URL in cleartext.
> A malicious server could easily grab this information from the pop-up.
> This vulnerability is related to id="uniqkey-password-popup" and password-popup/popup.html.

> Fix:
