{
  "CVE-2019-10218": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Samba client code (libsmbclient) returns server-supplied filenames without checking for pathname separators.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The client does not validate server-supplied filenames for path separators like '/' or '../'.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious server can cause the client to access local pathnames for reading or writing instead of SMB network pathnames, potentially creating files outside of the current working directory using the client's privileges.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious SMB server can send specially crafted filenames containing path separators to a vulnerable Samba client during file retrieval.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control a SMB server that the vulnerable client connects to. No specific SMB protocol version is required (SMB1/2/3 can be used). The attacker does not require any authentication."
