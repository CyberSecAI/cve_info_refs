## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens recommends users update TIA Administrator to Version 1.0 SP1 Upd1. Updates can be found at the following link:

<https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/114358>

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Restrict access to Port 8888/TCP to localhost

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for industrial security (download: <https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security>), and follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information, please see Siemens Security Advisory SSA-834884 at the following location:

<http://www.siemens.com/cert/advisories>

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability. This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) is an engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC Panels,
SIMATIC Industrial PCs, and Standard PCs running WinCC Runtime Advanced or SCADA System WinCC
Runtime Professional visualization software.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Siemens Network Planner (SINETPLAN) supports you as a planner of automation systems based on
PROFINET. It facilitates the professional planning, calculation, and simulation of load in a PROFINET
network and supports virtual commissioning of the network. SINETPLAN provides the capability to
efﬁciently plan and layout PROFINET networks. It supports both “non-real-time communication”, such as
when TCP/IP data is used, as well as real-time (RT) or IRT communication.
