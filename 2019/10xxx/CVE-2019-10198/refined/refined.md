  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2019-10198",
    "description": "An authorization bypass vulnerability was discovered in Foreman. Previously, commit tasks were searched through find_resource, which performed authorization checks. After the change to Foreman, an unauthenticated user can view the details of a task through the web UI or API, if they can discover or guess the UUID of the task.",
    "affected_components": [
      "foreman-tasks"
    ],
    "root_cause": "A code change in foreman-tasks that bypassed authorization checks when accessing task details. Tasks were no longer looked up using find_resource after commit 79a0e2cb5, which performed authorization checks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authorization bypass",
       "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated user can view the details of tasks, including potentially sensitive data, if they know the UUID of the task.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Web UI",
      "API"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Knowledge of a valid task UUID. No authentication or special privileges are needed. "
