| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-04-03 21:19:03 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in recoveryID search field at KRA's DRM agent page in authorize recovery tab, this user input is not being sanitized and therefore it is vulnerable to a reflected XSS.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c1)  Cedric Buissart    2019-05-29 09:44:18 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Pritam Singh (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c7)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-03 16:30:40 UTC  ``` Statement:  This vulnerability is rated Low : the web UI uses client TLS authentication, therefore stealing session cookies will not be sufficient for unauthorized access. The vulnerable page itself does not contain secrets.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c8)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-03 16:31:08 UTC  ``` Created pki-core tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1797689](show_bug.cgi?id=1797689 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-10179 pki-core: pki-core/pki-kra: Reflected XSS in recoveryID search field at KRA's DRM agent page in authorize recovery tab [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c9)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-02-07 06:28:57 UTC  ``` Do you know if this was reported in the upstream issue tracker and there is a fix?   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c10)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-07 14:02:39 UTC  ``` Upstream is aware. There is currently no fix. However, the security consequences are very limited.  e.g. : Thanks to the webUI using client side TLS authentication, stealing a cookie will not be of much use to the attacker.  At the moment, the only concerns are defacing.  If/when there is a fix upstream, it will be posted on this bug tracker.  I hope this helps!   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1695901#c11)  Product Security DevOps Team    2020-11-04 02:21:18 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
