- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled resource consumption due to a flood of network packets. This high network load can consume CPU power, affecting the normal operation of the device and influencing the configured cycle time of the PLC.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400) leading to denial-of-service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in a denial-of-service, where the PLC's normal operation is disrupted due to the PLC's processing cycle being affected by the excessive network traffic. This can lead to the PLC not responding as intended.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is conducted remotely by flooding the PLC with network packets.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers require a network connection to the PLC and the capability to send a high volume of network packets. No authentication or user interaction is required.
