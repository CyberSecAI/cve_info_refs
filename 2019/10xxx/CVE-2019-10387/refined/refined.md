Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10387:

**CVE-2019-10387:**

*   **Root Cause:** The XL TestView Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on a form validation method, allowing unauthorized access to functionality.
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can exploit the vulnerability to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credential IDs.
    *   This can lead to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins, potentially allowing an attacker to gain further access or control.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker exploits the lack of permission checks on the form validation method.
    *   The attacker leverages the CSRF vulnerability to make unauthorized requests.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious URL and credential IDs to the vulnerable form validation method.
    *   The attacker needs to induce the victim to initiate the connection test by the plugin, or perform the request directly.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in XL TestView Plugin versions up to and including 1.2.0.
*   As of the publication of the security advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
