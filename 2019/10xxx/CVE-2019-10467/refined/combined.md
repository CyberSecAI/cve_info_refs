SECURITY-1628 / CVE-2019-10459
Mattermost allows the definition of incoming (from the perspective of the
service) webhook URLs. These contain what is effectively a secret token as
part of the URL.

Mattermost Notification Plugin stored these webhook URLs as part of its
global configuration file jenkins.plugins.mattermost.MattermostNotifier.xml
and job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These URLs could be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job config.xml files)
or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1546 / CVE-2019-10460
Bitbucket OAuth Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in the global
config.xml configuration file on the Jenkins master. This credential could
be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

Bitbucket OAuth Plugin now stores this credential encrypted.

SECURITY-1621 / CVE-2019-10476
Zulip Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration
file jenkins.plugins.zulip.ZulipNotifier.xml, as well as in the legacy
configuration file hudson.plugins.humbug.HumbugNotifier.xml on the Jenkins
master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

SECURITY-1477 / CVE-2019-10461
Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in
its global configuration file
com.dynatrace.jenkins.dashboard.TAGlobalConfiguration.xml on the Jenkins
master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

SECURITY-1483 (1) / CVE-2019-10462
Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin did not require POST requests on a
method implementing form validation. This CSRF vulnerability allowed
attackers to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server
with attacker-specified username and password.

SECURITY-1483 (2) / CVE-2019-10463
Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin does not perform permission checks
on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an
attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-820 / CVE-2019-10464 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10465 (permission check)
Deploy WebLogic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm
the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins master.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-822 / CVE-2019-10466
360 FireLine Plugin accepts XML for part of its configuration. It does not
configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

A form validation method that accepts XML does not perform permission
checks. This allows users with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins
parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or
denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1003 / CVE-2019-10467
Sonar Gerrit Plugin stores a credential unencrypted in job config.xml files
on the Jenkins master if the 'Override Credentials' option is used. This
credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1005 (1) / CVE-2019-10468 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10469 (permission check)
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL
using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1005 (2) / CVE-2019-10470
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin provides a list of applicable
credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to
use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (1) / CVE-2019-10471 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10472 (permission check)

implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (2) / CVE-2019-10473
Libvirt Slaves Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

Global Post Script Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
permission to list the files contained in $JENKINS_HOME/global-post-script
that can be used by the plugin.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1490 / CVE-2019-10475
build-metrics Plugin does not properly escape the label query parameter,
resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Introduction

The plugin shares [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/) feedback with developers via [Gerrit Code Review](https://www.gerritcodereview.com/).

## Requirements

### Jenkins

Jenkins version 2.249.3 or newer is required.

### SonarQube

SonarQube report generation *must* happen within [SonarQube Scanner](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/) wrapper.

On a non-pipeline job, you can enable [SonarQube Scanner](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/) wrapper by checking `Prepare SonarQube Scanner environment`:

[![Sonar scanner wrapper](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/sonar-scanner-wrapper.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/sonar-scanner-wrapper.png)

On a pipeline job, [SonarQube Scanner](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/) wrapper is represented by `withSonarQubeEnv`. For example:

```
withSonarQubeEnv('my-sonar-installation-name') {
    withMaven(maven: 'my-maven-installation-name') {
        sh "mvn clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.pullrequest.key=${env.GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER}-${env.GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER} -Dsonar.pullrequest.base=${env.GERRIT_BRANCH} -Dsonar.pullrequest.branch=${env.GERRIT_REFSPEC}"
    }
}
```

### Gerrit

#### Gerrit Trigger configuration

[Gerrit Trigger](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger/) plugin should be installed and configured.

Rest API should be configured in the Advanced section of Gerrit Trigger settings.

HTTP authentication data should be set up. Enable Code-Review and Enable Verified checkboxes should be checked on.

For complete guidance please see [Gerrit Trigger Wiki page](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gerrit-trigger/#plugin-content-setup-requirements).

[![Gerrit Trigger configuration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/gerrit-trigger-conf.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/gerrit-trigger-conf.png)

#### Running out of Gerrit Trigger job

In case when the plugin is runing outside of a job with Gerrit Trigger the next environmental variables should be set:

* `GERRIT_NAME` - Gerrit server name
* `GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER` - Change number
* `GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER` - Patchset number

## Setup

### Install plugin

Install the plugin via Jenkins plugin manager. Gerrit Trigger plugin should be also installed and configured.

### Configure build

Sonar Gerrit plugin is intended to run as post-build action. Choose it from available post-build actions.

### Plugin settings

There are several settings allowing to customise the plugin for your needs.

#### SonarQube Settings

##### Pull request analysis (since SonarQube 7.2)

This analysis strategy is based on <https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/pull-request/> .

The SonarQube instance must either have [sonarqube-community-branch-plugin](https://github.com/mc1arke/sonarqube-community-branch-plugin) enabled or be of [developer edition](https://www.sonarqube.org/developer-edition/) type.

In order to run a pull request scan, `Sonar` requires the following mandatory properties:

| Key | Recommended value template | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sonar.pullrequest.key | ${GERRIT\_CHANGE\_NUMBER}-${GERRIT\_PATCHSET\_NUMBER} | 250-1 |
| sonar.pullrequest.base | ${GERRIT\_BRANCH} | master |
| sonar.pullrequest.branch | ${GERRIT\_REFSPEC} | refs/changes/01/1/1 |

Example of `Maven` target:

```
clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.pullrequest.key=${GERRIT_CHANGE_NUMBER}-${GERRIT_PATCHSET_NUMBER} -Dsonar.pullrequest.base=${GERRIT_BRANCH} -Dsonar.pullrequest.branch=${GERRIT_REFSPEC}

```

###### Non pipeline

[![Gerrit Trigger configuration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/sonar-pull-request-analysis-radio.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/sonar-pull-request-analysis-radio.png)

###### Pipeline

```
sonarToGerrit(
        inspectionConfig: [
                analysisStrategy: pullRequest()
        ]
)
```

##### Preview mode analysis (until SonarQube 7.6)

This analysis strategy is intended to work with report provided by SonarQube running on a project in preview mode. That means SonarQube report generation should be included to build.

If you use Maven, fill out "Goals and options" field in "Build" section of your Jenkins job:

```
clean verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.analysis.mode=preview -Dsonar.report.export.path=sonar-report.json
```

###### Non pipeline

Use setting "Project configuration" if only one SonarQube report is generated and static code analysis of the whole project is required.

[![Sonar settings base](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/sonar-settings-base.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/sonar-settings-base.png)

Use setting "Sub-project configurations" to specify modules and paths for separate reports if modules are analysed separately or not every module needs to be analysed.

[![Sonar settings multi](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/sonar-settings-multi.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/sonar-settings-multi.png)

Settings:

1. SonarQube installation - The SonarQube installation (see <https://plugins.jenkins.io/sonar/>) to be used for analysis. It is also used to provide a link to a SonarQube rule in Gerrit comments.
2. Project base directory - subdirectory for a case when Jenkins job is related to a specific module of a big project. The path is relative to a main project root directory. Default value is empty.
3. SonarQube report path - Path to a SonarQube report generated by SonarQube while a project was being built. The path is relative to a build working directory. Default value: `target/sonar/sonar-report.json`
4. Allow auto match - setting to allow automatically match SonarQube issues to Gerrit files in case if project consists of several sub-modules, but only one SonarQube report is generated for the whole project.

###### Pipeline

```
sonarToGerrit(
        inspectionConfig: [
                analysisStrategy: previewMode(
                        sonarQubeInstallationName: 'My SonarQube Installation',
                        baseConfig: [
                                projectPath    : '',
                                sonarReportPath: 'target/sonar/sonar-report.json',
                                autoMatch      : true
                        ]
                        // OR
                        //subJobConfigs : [
                        //  [
                        //      projectPath: 'module0',
                        //      sonarReportPath: 'target/sonar/sonar-report.json'
                        //  ],
                        //  [
                        //      projectPath: 'module1',
                        //      sonarReportPath: 'target/module1/sonar/sonar-report.json'
                        //  ]
                        //]
                )
        ]
)
```

#### Filter

Filter is used to specify what issues will be affected in the output:

* to be commented
* to affect review score
* etc

It is possible to filter issues by:

1. Severity - SonarQube issue severity. If user doesn't want issues with low severity to be reported to Gerrit, he (or she) can choose the lowest severity level to be reported. For example if "Major" level is selected, information about issues with "Major", "Critical" and "Blocker" will be included to Gerrit review. Default value: Info.
2. New issues only - reflects SonarQube issue "new" property. If issue is not marked as new that may be a sign that it is not created by processing commit and this issue is not supposed to be included to review.
3. Changed lines only - when only several lines are changed in a commit user may not want other lines to be commented by Gerrit. With "Add comments to changed lines only" unchanged in the commit lines will not be commented in Gerrit.
4. Included paths' glob pattern - The glob pattern that file paths should match to be included by the filter. Leaving a blank value or setting value `**/*` means any file path will match. Tested file paths always start with `/`.
5. Excluded paths' glob pattern - The glob pattern that file paths should match to be excluded by the filter. Leaving a blank value means no file path will match. Tested file paths always start with `/`.

[![Filter settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/filter-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/filter-settings.png)

#### Review Settings

Review settings contains of issue filter to specify issues to be commented and review template.

[![Review settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/review-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/review-settings.png)

##### Review Comment Type

Posted review comments can be of one of the following types :

* `STANDARD` - The usual review comment that everyone use.
* `ROBOT` - Available since Gerrit 2.14. Review comment type to be used by robots. See <https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-robot-comments.html> for more details.

##### Report Formatting

This section allows user to customise text, intended to use as review title and issue comment.

1. Title - Review title settings allow customization of Gerrit review titles for both cases (violations found or not) separately. There are several tags to be replaced by real values allowed in this context:
   1. <info\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having INFO severity level;
   2. <minor\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having MINOR severity level;
   3. <major\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having MAJOR severity level;
   4. <critical\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having CRITICAL severity level;
   5. <blocker\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having BLOCKER severity level;
   6. <min\_minor\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having MINOR severity level or higher;
   7. <min\_major\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having MAJOR severity level or higher;
   8. <min\_critical\_count> - will be replaced with count of issues having CRITICAL severity level or higher;
   9. <total\_count> - will be replaced with total count of issues.
2. Comment - Issue comment pattern. Available tags:
   1. <key> - will be replaced with issue key;
   2. <component> - will be replaced with issue component info;
   3. <message> - will be replaced with issue message;
   4. <severity> - will be replaced with issue severity;
   5. <rule> - will be replaced with issue rule name;
   6. <rule\_url> - will be replaced with link to rule description on SonarQube;
   7. <status> - will be replaced with issue status;
   8. <creation\_date> - will be replaced with issue creation date.

#### Score Settings

Starting with v. 2.1 it's become possible to specify a separate filter for score settings.

[![Score settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/score-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/score-settings.png)

1. Post score - This setting describes whether it is necessary to post score to Gerrit or not.
2. Category - Gerrit category used for score posting. Default value: Code-Review.
3. Score for no SonarQube violation found case - Score to be posted to Gerrit. Default value: +1
4. Score for SonarQube violations found case - Score to be posted to Gerrit. Default value: -1

Please note: to use Gerrit category other than Default it is necessary to configure it in Gerrit. See details in [Gerrit Documentation](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/config-labels.html).

An example of settings to be added to the project.config for creating Sonar-Verified category:

```
[label "Sonar-Verified"]
    function = MaxWithBlock
    value = -1 Issues found
    value =  0 No score
    value = +1 Verified
    defaultValue = 0

```

And access rights:

```
[access "refs/heads/*"]
    label-Sonar-Verified = -1..+1 group Project Owners
    label-Sonar-Verified = -1..+1 group Non-Interactive Users

```

#### Credentials override

To override the credentials used to post comments on the job level set up section "Override default HTTP credentials". ( Global credentials on the Gerrit Trigger Server level should be set up as well for Gerrit Trigger needs.)

[![Credentials settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/credentials-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/credentials-settings.png)

1. Override default HTTP credentials? - This setting describes whether it is necessary to override Gerrit credentials from the Gerrit Trigger Server settings or not.
2. HTTP credentials - Credentials to be used to post review result to Gerrit.
3. Gerrit Server - The server used to check connection with overridden credentials. The value *does not* affect plugin settings and only used to verify credentials.

#### Notification Settings

This functionality works when Gerrit is configured with post server settings.

1. To be notified if no SonarQube violations found - Choice of persons to be notified. Default value: None.
2. To be notified if SonarQube violations found - Choice of persons to be notified. Default value: Owner.
3. To be notified if negative score is posted - Choice of persons to be notified. Default value: Owner.

Options :

* None - No notification regarding particular review will be sent.
* Owner - Notification with review results will be sent to a change owner.
* Owner & Reviewers - Notification with review results will be sent to an owner and to all the change reviewers added to the change.
* All - Everyone in Gerrit project will receive notification.

[![Notification settings](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/notification-settings.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/notification-settings.png)

## Troubleshooting

### Plugin fails build with message "Unable to post review. Request failed"

This message occurres when RestAPIException is thrown by Gerrit API on attempt to post request.

Since version 1.0.7 it is possible to obtain a full stacktrace of the exception using a logger for class `org.jenkinsci.plugins.sonargerrit.SonarToGerritPublisher`

[![Plugin failure](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin@master/doc/plugin-fails.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/sonar-gerrit-plugin/blob/master/doc/plugin-fails.png)

The log will contain necessary information about the exception as follows:

## Version incompatibilities

### Version 1.0.5

In this version plugin settings has moved from Build Steps to Post Build Actions. User needs to reconfigure jobs, or settings will be erased to default.
