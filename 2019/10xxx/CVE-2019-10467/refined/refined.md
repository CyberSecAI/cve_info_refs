Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Sonar Gerrit Plugin stores credentials unencrypted within job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master when the 'Override Credentials' option is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary weakness is storing a credential in plain text within the `config.xml` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins master's file system or have "Extended Read" permissions on job configurations can view the unencrypted credential.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The exposed credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to resources protected by those credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins master's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files.
- **Extended Read Permission:** A user with "Extended Read" permissions on a job can also read the configuration file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs either:
    - Access to the Jenkins master's file system, or
    - "Extended Read" permissions on job configurations.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the Sonar Gerrit Plugin if the 'Override Credentials' option is used.
- There is no fix for this vulnerability mentioned as of the advisory publication date, October 23, 2019.
- The advisory mentions that the credential is not encrypted when stored.
