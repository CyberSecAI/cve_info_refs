[CVE-2019-10754  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10754) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-338  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-oauth-core-api` to version 6.1.0-RC5 or higher.

## Overview

[org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-oauth-core-api](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apereo.cas/cas-server-support-oauth-core-api) is a CAS Server Support OAuth Core API for supporting OAuth within Apereo CAS.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness. A insecure source of randomness is used to generate all of its random values as it relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`. This could allow an attacker to possibly generate their own unique Ticket ID due to insufficient randomness.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a proof-of-concept or detailed explanation of how to exploit this vulnerability.

Proof of conceptEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.

[CVE-2019-10754  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10754) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-338  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-simple-mfa` to version 6.1.0-RC5 or higher.

## Overview

[org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-simple-mfa](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apereo.cas/cas-server-support-simple-mfa) is an is package that allows Apereo CAS to act as a multifactor authentication provider on its own, issuing tokens and sending them to end-users via pre-defined communication channels such as email or text messages.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness. A insecure source of randomness is used to generate all of its random values as it relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`. This could allow an attacker to possibly generate their own unique Ticket ID due to insufficient randomness.

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

8.1 high

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker requires privileges that provide basic user capabilities that could normally affect only settings and files owned by a user. Alternatively, an attacker with Low privileges has the ability to access only non-sensitive resources.

  **Low**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is no impact to availability within the impacted component.

  **None**

## How to fix?

Upgrade `org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-shell` to version 6.1.0-RC5 or higher.

## Overview

[org.apereo.cas:cas-server-support-shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/6.0.x/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html) is a package for the CAS command-line shell provides the ability to query the CAS server for help on available settings/modules and various other utility functions.

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness. A insecure source of randomness is used to generate all of its random values as it relies upon apache commons lang3 `RandomStringUtils`. This could allow an attacker to possibly generate their own unique Ticket ID due to insufficient randomness.
