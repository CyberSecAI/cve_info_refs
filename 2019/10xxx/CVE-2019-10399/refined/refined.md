Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-10399:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Script Security Plugin's sandbox protection could be bypassed due to crafted property names in property expressions within increment and decrement expressions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Sandbox bypass: The plugin failed to properly sanitize or validate property names within specific expressions, allowing malicious code to circumvent sandbox restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Arbitrary code execution: Attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts could execute arbitrary code within the context of the Jenkins controller JVM. This allows for complete control over the Jenkins instance and the systems it manages.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Crafted property names in increment and decrement expressions within sandboxed scripts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to specify and run sandboxed scripts within the Jenkins environment. This typically involves having Job/Configure permissions or the ability to inject malicious script code via other vulnerabilities.
