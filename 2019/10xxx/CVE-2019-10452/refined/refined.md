Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-10452:

**CVE-2019-10452**

*   **Root Cause:** The View26 Test-Reporting Plugin stores access tokens in plain text within job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weakness:**  Sensitive data (access tokens) are stored unencrypted, making them easily accessible to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the plaintext access tokens. This would enable the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the View26 service and related data, possibly manipulating test results or gaining information regarding the testing process.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is exploited by accessing the Jenkins controller's filesystem or by having extended read access to job `config.xml` files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs one of the following:
    *   Extended Read permission on the Jenkins instance
    *   Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
