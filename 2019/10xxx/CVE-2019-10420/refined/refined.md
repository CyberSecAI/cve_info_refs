Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10420:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Assembla Plugin stores the Assembla password unencrypted in its global configuration file (`jenkins.plugin.assembla.AssemblaProjectProperty.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of the Assembla password in plaintext within the plugin's configuration file. This exposes the password to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can read the configuration file and obtain the Assembla password.
- **Unauthorized Access:**  The exposed password can be used to gain unauthorized access to the linked Assembla account and any associated resources, potentially leading to further attacks on the Jenkins environment or related systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** The primary attack vector involves direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system where the plugin's configuration file is stored.
- **Privileged Access:** An attacker needs at least read access to the relevant file to extract the plaintext password. This typically requires local system access to the Jenkins controller.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local File System Access:** An attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
- **User Level Access:**  The attacker needs to have user-level access to the file system. This access could be gained through vulnerabilities in other parts of the Jenkins system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states that there is no fix for this vulnerability as of the publication date.
- The vulnerability is specific to the Assembla plugin and does not affect Jenkins core.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of low
