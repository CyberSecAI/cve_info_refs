The provided content relates to CVE-2019-10734.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way email clients, including Trojita, handle partially encrypted multipart messages. Specifically, when a multipart email contains encrypted parts along with attacker-controlled text, the client decrypts the encrypted parts and merges them with the attacker's text. If a user replies to such an email, the decrypted content is also quoted, thus leaking the plaintext to the attacker.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-   **Decryption Oracle:** The email client acts as a decryption oracle when it decrypts the embedded ciphertext and includes it in the reply message.
-   **Lack of MIME parsing security:** The email clients do not enforce that the encrypted part should be the root node of the MIME tree. Instead, they decrypt any encrypted part present in the email, even if it is nested within other parts.
-   **Improper handling of multipart messages:** The email clients merge multiple text or HTML parts into a single document when replying, making them vulnerable to attacks that hide the original plaintext.
-   **HTML and CSS support:** The use of HTML and CSS allows attackers to inject malicious code to hide the original plaintext or to display different content to different users, exploiting the decryption and signing process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-   **Plaintext leakage:** An attacker can obtain the plaintext of encrypted emails by embedding them in a crafted multipart message and inducing the victim to reply.
-   **Signing oracle:** An attacker can make a victim sign arbitrary content by crafting a message that displays different content based on CSS conditional rules and have the victim reply to it.
-   **Bypass authentication:** An attacker can use the obtained signatures to trick third parties that rely on the authenticity of signed messages

**Attack vectors:**
-   The attacker needs to obtain PGP or S/MIME encrypted messages (e.g., through man-in-the-middle attacks, compromised mail servers, or leaked emails).
-   The attacker crafts a multipart email with a benign-looking message, embedding the ciphertext within the MIME structure.
-   The attacker sends the crafted email to the victim.
-   When the victim replies, the decrypted plaintext is included in the reply, leaking it to the attacker.
-   For signing attacks, the attacker sends a specially crafted HTML/CSS email to trick a user into signing malicious content along with visible content upon replying.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-   Ability to intercept or obtain encrypted emails.
-   Ability to send emails to the victim.
-   Basic knowledge of MIME structure, HTML, and CSS.

The provided content also includes a bug report from the KDE bug tracking system, which confirms the vulnerability and provides a patch for the Trojita email client. The patch prevents quoting any plaintext that originated from an encrypted message, addressing the decryption oracle attack.
