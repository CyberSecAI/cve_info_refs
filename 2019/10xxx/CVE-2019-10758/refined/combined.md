### Threat Intelligence

Exploit Maturity

Snyk has a published code exploit for this vulnerability.

MatureEPSS

The probability is the direct output of the EPSS model, and conveys an overall sense of the threat of
exploitation in the wild. The percentile measures the EPSS probability relative to all known EPSS scores.
Note: This data is updated daily, relying on the latest available EPSS model version.
Check out the EPSS
[documentation](https://www.first.org/epss/articles/prob_percentile_bins)

[CVE-2019-10758  (opens in a new tab)](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2019-10758) Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) are common identifiers for publicly known security vulnerabilities[CWE-94  (opens in a new tab)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html) Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) is a category system for software weaknesses First added by Snyk
## How to fix?

Upgrade `mongo-express` to version 0.54.0 or higher.

## Overview

[mongo-express](https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express#readme) is a web-based MongoDB admin interface written with Node.js, Express and Bootstrap3

Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via endpoints that use the `toBSON` method. A misuse of the `vm` dependency to perform `exec` commands in a non-safe environment.

## PoC by Jonathan Leitschuh

```
# MacOS
this.constructor.constructor("return process")().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator')

  it('should not be executable', function () {
      const test = `
      this.constructor.constructor("return console")().log(this.constructor.constructor("return process")().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('id').toString())
      `;
      const result = bson.toBSON(calculatorTest);
    });

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

10 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can affect resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority of the vulnerable component. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are different and managed by different security authorities.

  **Changed**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

# Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

High

[dozoisch](/dozoisch)
published
GHSA-h47j-hc6x-h3qq
Dec 30, 2019
·
1 comment

## Package

npm

mongo-express
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<0.54.0

## Patched versions

0.54.0

## Description

### Impact

Remote code execution on the host machine by any authenticated user.

### Proof Of Concept

Launching mongo-express on a Mac, pasting the following into the "create index" field will pop open the Mac calculator:

```
this.constructor.constructor("return process")().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('/Applications/Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator')
```
### Patches

Users should upgrade to version `0.54.0`

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

[@JLLeitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh) yep, have to as query-parser was missing support for the $db parameter, and Timestamp was using the new bson format, while the dependency was still using the old format, so needed to make sure they were consistent.

I'll try to PR back the $db parameter in query-parser

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.

# Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog

For the benefit of the cybersecurity community and network defenders—and to help every organization better manage vulnerabilities and keep pace with threat activity—CISA maintains the authoritative source of vulnerabilities that have been exploited in the wild. Organizations should use the KEV catalog as an input to their vulnerability management prioritization framework.

[How to use the KEV Catalog](/known-exploited-vulnerabilities "How to use the KEV Catalog")

**The KEV catalog is also available in these formats:**
