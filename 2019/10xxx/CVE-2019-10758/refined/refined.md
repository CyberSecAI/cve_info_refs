  "CVE-2019-10758": {
    "description": "The `mongo-express` package before version 0.54.0 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via endpoints that use the `toBSON` method. A misuse of the `vm` dependency allows for `exec` command execution in a non-safe environment.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of the `vm` dependency in an insecure way, specifically by using it to perform `exec` commands, coupled with the usage of `toBSON` method on user-controlled input.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
        "Insecure use of `vm` module",
        "Lack of input sanitization"
      ],
       "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host machine where the `mongo-express` application is running. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data breaches, malware installation, and denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks through HTTP requests to vulnerable endpoints",
         "Specifically, through endpoints using the `toBSON` method."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a crafted POST request with a malicious JavaScript payload within a `document` parameter. No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker can be unauthenticated."
    },
        "affected_versions": "<0.54.0",

    "cvss_scores": {
        "snyk": "10 critical",
         "nvd": "9.9 critical"
    },
    "remediation": "Upgrade `mongo-express` to version 0.54.0 or higher.",
