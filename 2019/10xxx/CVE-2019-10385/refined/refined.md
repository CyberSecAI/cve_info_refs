Vulnerability: Plaintext Storage of Credentials
- Root cause: The eggplant-plugin Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files.
- Weakness: Credentials are not encrypted.
- Impact: An attacker with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system, can view the unencrypted credentials.
- Attack vector: By gaining access to the Jenkins controller file system or obtaining Extended Read permissions.
- Required attacker capabilities: Access to the Jenkins controller file system, or Extended Read permissions.
