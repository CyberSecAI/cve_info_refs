Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10753

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the `com.diffplug.spotless:spotless-eclipse-wtp` library resolving dependencies over an insecure HTTP channel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unsafe Dependency Resolution:** The library fetches dependencies using HTTP, which is not encrypted and can be intercepted.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:**  An attacker positioned on the network can intercept the unencrypted dependency requests and potentially alter the downloaded artifacts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Compromised Build Artifacts:** A successful MitM attack could allow a malicious actor to modify the build artifacts during the dependency resolution process.
*   **Supply Chain Compromise:** If the altered artifacts are used in further development processes, they could lead to compromised software that would affect all users of those artifacts.
*   **Potential Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impact:** Data can be potentially disclosed, modified and availability reduced.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based Attack:** The attack occurs over the network, leveraging the insecure HTTP protocol.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM):** An attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the build process and the server hosting the dependencies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, e.g. being on the same network as the build machine or controlling a network hop along the path to the dependency server.
*   **No Prior Authorization:** The attacker does not require prior authorization or access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**
* The vulnerability is considered "remotely exploitable" as it can be exploited over a network.
* The probability of a successful attack is considered low, however, the maintainers haven't confirmed if the artifacts are not compromised.
* The recommended fix is to upgrade to version 3.9.6 or higher, which presumably resolves the insecure dependency resolution issue.
* The vulnerability is assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 5.6 (Medium)
* The vulnerability is associated with CWE-494 (Download of Code Without Integrity Check) and CWE-829 (Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere)
