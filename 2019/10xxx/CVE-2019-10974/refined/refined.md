- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to prevent an exception handler from being overwritten with arbitrary code, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable locally and requires low skill level. The attack vector is local and the attacker must have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the system, and needs low skill level to exploit this vulnerability.
