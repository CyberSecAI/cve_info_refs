Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Ansible Tower Plugin provided a functionality that lists applicable credential IDs for users configuring the plugin. This functionality failed to perform permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authorization Check:** The plugin allowed users with `Overall/Read` permission to access a list of valid credential IDs without requiring appropriate permissions. This is a vulnerability of type broken access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with `Overall/Read` access could enumerate valid credential IDs.
- **Chaining with other vulnerabilities:** The disclosed credential IDs could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-10310 and CVE-2019-10311) to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker requires a Jenkins account with at least `Overall/Read` permissions.
- **Direct Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a direct request to the vulnerable API endpoint responsible for listing credential IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have a user account on the Jenkins instance with at least the `Overall/Read` permission.
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by implementing a permission check. Access to the credential ID list now requires `Overall/Administer` permissions.
- This vulnerability is closely related to other vulnerabilities in the same plugin (CVE-2019-10310 and CVE-2019-10311), highlighting a pattern of missing permission checks and CSRF vulnerabilities.
- The advisory explicitly states that the vulnerability allows enumeration of credential IDs which could then be used to capture credentials using *another* vulnerability.
- The fix for the vulnerability is included in Ansible Tower Plugin version 0.9.2.
