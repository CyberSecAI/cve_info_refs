The provided content is related to CVE-2019-10456.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Classic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing permission check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on a form validation method.
*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can leverage the missing permission check to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server using attacker-specified username and password.
*   The CSRF vulnerability can allow an attacker to trigger the connection test on behalf of a logged-in user without their consent.
*   This can lead to potential information disclosure or unauthorized actions by interacting with the attacker controlled server with the victim's credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can exploit the missing permission check by crafting malicious requests that initiate the connection test to an attacker-controlled server.
*   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a logged-in Jenkins user into visiting a malicious webpage that triggers a connection test to an attacker-specified server without the victim's consent.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in user to perform an action (CSRF attack) or directly make requests.
