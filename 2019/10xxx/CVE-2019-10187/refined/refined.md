Based on the provided documents, here's the information related to CVE-2019-10187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in Moodle's glossary functionality. Users with permission to delete entries from a glossary were able to delete entries from *other* glossaries, even those they did not have direct access to.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is a lack of proper access control checks when deleting glossary entries. The system failed to verify if a user had the necessary permissions to modify entries in the specific glossary they were targeting.
*   **Authorization Bypass:** This lack of proper checks allowed users to bypass intended authorization mechanisms, effectively granting them the ability to delete entries they should not have been able to modify.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Loss/Manipulation:** An attacker with delete permissions in one glossary could delete entries from other glossaries.
*   **Potential for Disruption:** The ability to delete glossary entries could lead to disruption of course materials or negatively impact the educational environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the Moodle web interface, specifically through the glossary deletion functionality.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have an authenticated Moodle account with permission to delete entries in at least one glossary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a logged in Moodle user.
*   **Delete Permission:** The attacker must have the permission to delete entries from *at least one* glossary within the Moodle system.
*   **No Direct Access Required:** The attacker does not need direct access or privileges to the glossary they are deleting entries from.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Moodle versions 3.7, 3.6 to 3.6.4, and 3.5 to 3.5.6, as well as earlier unsupported versions.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Moodle versions 3.7.1, 3.6.5, and 3.5.7.
*   The Moodle Tracker issue is MDL-64623, and the relevant code change can be found at http://git.moodle.org/gw?p=moodle.git&a=search&h=HEAD&st=commit&s=MDL-64623.
*   The severity is rated as "Minor."
