Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10374:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:**
The PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to render Markdown formatted descriptions.  It does not prevent the use of the `javascript:` scheme in URLs for links. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Improper input sanitization: The plugin fails to sanitize or escape the `javascript:` scheme within URLs used in Markdown formatted descriptions.
- Lack of context-aware escaping: The plugin does not properly escape the user-provided content before rendering it in the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim's browser.
- Potential for session hijacking, credential theft, defacement, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a malicious user who can configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are rendered by the PegDown Formatter plugin.
-  A user with the ability to configure Jenkins jobs or other elements using the plugin can include a link with a `javascript:` URL in the description.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the permission to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties rendered by the PegDown Formatter. This typically means having at least Job/Configure permissions.
- The victim must view the page containing the malicious link, thus triggering the JavaScript execution.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity.
- There is no fix available for the plugin as of the advisory publication date.
- This is a stored XSS vulnerability, meaning the malicious payload is stored in the Jenkins system and executed whenever a user views the affected content.
