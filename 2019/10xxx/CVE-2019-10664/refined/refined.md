Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10664:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an SQL injection flaw in the Domoticz application, specifically related to how it handles the `idx` parameter in the `/images/floorplans/plan` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize the `idx` parameter before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code. The vulnerable code was: `result = m_sql.safe_queryBlob("SELECT Image FROM Floorplans WHERE ID=%s", idx.c_str());` which was then replaced by `result = m_sql.safe_queryBlob("SELECT Image FROM Floorplans WHERE ID=%d", atol(idx.c_str()));`
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication under certain conditions, allowing an unauthenticated user to access sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SQL injection to extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials.
- **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** While the primary vulnerability is SQL injection, the exploit leverages it to bypass authentication and then inject operating system commands that can be executed on the server using the UVC camera settings.
- **System Compromise:** By executing arbitrary commands, an attacker could potentially take full control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Requests:** The primary attack vector involves sending crafted HTTP requests to the Domoticz server.
- **SQL Injection via `/images/floorplans/plan` endpoint:** The `idx` parameter is manipulated to inject malicious SQL.
- **UVC Camera Configuration:** The attacker leverages the application's UVC camera configuration settings to inject commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Domoticz server.
- **Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to craft SQL injection payloads.
- **No prior authentication needed** (under certain conditions). The exploit leverages the SQL injection to steal credentials if authentication is enabled.

**Additional Details from Exploit Code:**

- The exploit code shows three different methods for command injection:
    1.  **Default mode:** Injects commands into a script and serves it via HTTP, then uses `curl` to download it on the target system.
    2. **Zip icon pack upload:**  Embeds commands in a fake zip icon pack, which is then uploaded to the server.
    3.  **Direct injection:** Directly injects commands into the UVC camera parameters.
- The code uses the SQL injection vulnerability to extract the username and password if authentication is enabled.
- It bypasses authentication by manipulating the UVC camera settings to inject commands.
- The exploit can add a new UVC camera if one does not exist.
- The injected commands are executed when a snapshot of the camera is requested through `camsnapshot.jpg`.

**Summary:**
The provided information details an SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2019-10664) in Domoticz that allows unauthenticated attackers (under certain conditions) to extract sensitive information, bypass authentication and inject OS commands which results in remote command execution. The exploit code provides several methods to achieve this RCE by manipulating settings and injecting commands through various attack vectors, exploiting the SQL injection flaw and the UVC camera configuration features.
