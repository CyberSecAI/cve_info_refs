The provided content describes a merged pull request that fixes XSS vulnerabilities in the snipe-it repository.

Root cause of vulnerability:
*   Data was not being properly escaped in the API.
*   A bug in Select2 that parses HTML in the DOM when the "selected" method fires, even if the data sent to Select2 was properly escaped. This occurs when using remote data loading via AJAX and HTML templates to display listbox data.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
*   XSS vulnerabilities due to improper data escaping.

Impact of exploitation:
*   The content does not specify the exact impact, but XSS vulnerabilities can lead to various issues, including session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

Attack vectors:
*   Sending malicious data to the API without proper escaping.
*   Exploiting the Select2 bug by injecting malicious HTML code into the data used by Select2's HTML template feature, specifically when using remote data loading via AJAX.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
*   Ability to send data to the API.
*   Ability to influence the data displayed in Select2 dropdowns when using HTML templates and remote data loading.
