Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-10770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the development mode error handler of the `io.ratpack:ratpack-core` library. When an exception message contains untrusted data, this error handler does not properly sanitize it, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, user-supplied data included in exception messages is rendered unsanitized in the development mode error page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, specifically a reflected XSS vulnerability because the user-provided input is directly included in the response.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The error handler in development mode fails to sanitize or escape user-provided data before displaying it in the error message, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML into the error page.
*   **Cookie Theft/Session Hijacking:** The injected script can be used to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** XSS exploits can expose sensitive data, enable access to privileged services, and deliver malware.
*   **Possible data modification**: While not explicitly stated, the provided info implies that data modification is possible (though limited in scope).

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning the attacker can exploit it remotely, potentially over the internet.
*   **User Interaction Required:** Exploiting this vulnerability requires a user to trigger the error condition, meaning the user must take an action that causes the vulnerable code to execute.
*   **Manipulating HTTP Requests:** Attackers can exploit this by crafting a malicious request containing crafted input (in the `message` query parameter) that triggers the vulnerable exception handler.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs the capability to send crafted requests to the application containing malicious input designed to trigger the vulnerable code.
*   **User Interaction**: A user must trigger the error condition for the malicious script to be executed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability only exists in the development mode error handler, not in the production error handler.
*   The Snyk advisory includes a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) showing how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by upgrading to version 1.7.6 or higher.
