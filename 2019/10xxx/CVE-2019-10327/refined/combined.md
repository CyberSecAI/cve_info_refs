Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following
releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Gitea Plugin 1.1.2
* InfluxDB Plugin 1.22
* Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.7.1
* Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin 1.5
* Warnings Next Generation Plugin 5.1.0

Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following
plugins:

* Artifactory Plugin

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-05-31/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1373 / CVE-2019-10325
Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings
parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included
HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings
parser names.

SECURITY-1391 / CVE-2019-10326
Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross-
site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning
counts for future builds.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent
via POST.

SECURITY-1409 / CVE-2019-10327
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a
way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary
directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have
Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities
for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request
forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External
Entities in XML documents.

SECURITY-921 / CVE-2019-10328
Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as
Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary
methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.

SECURITY-1403 / CVE-2019-10329
InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

SECURITY-1046 / CVE-2019-10330
Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to
the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not
be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit
access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to
Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the
configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull
request content when those are trusted.

SECURITY-1015 (1) / CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (permission check)
Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1015 (2) / CVE-2019-10323
Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1347 / CVE-2019-10324
Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to
trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

The Pipeline Maven Plugin provides an **advanced set of features** for using [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) in [Jenkins Pipelines](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/).

The `withMaven` step configures a maven environment to use within a pipeline job by calling `sh "mvn …​` or `bat "mvn …​`. The selected maven installation is configured and prepended to the path.

It provides **several [Features](#plugin-content-features) to simplify** the creation of your Pipeline scripts and ensure the **[Traceability of Maven builds](#plugin-content-feature-traceability)**.

It uses some **[Sensible default Maven parameters](#plugin-content-feature-sensible-default-maven-settings)** for a CI usage (batch-mode, …​) and **automatically configures the Jenkins [Report Publishers](#plugin-content-feature-publishers)** (Artifacts, JUnit, …​).

The **[Default Configuration](#plugin-content-feature-default-configuration) can be defined globally or at the folder level** to keep your pipeline code as short as possible while using the expected configuration (Maven settings.xml file…​) globally or locally.

This plugin allows transitioning smoothly from the legacy [Maven Integration](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin/) job type by allowing to reuse **[Maven Settings Support](#plugin-content-feature-maven-integration-global-settings)** and by proposing the **[Trigger downstream pipeline when a snapshot is built](#plugin-content-feature-trigger-downstream)**.

Please note **per default some features will not be available** and you will have to change/configure a database storage which suits your environment.

## Installation

The plugin can be found under the name `Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin` in the [Default Update Site](https://updates.jenkins.io/#default-update-site).

**For tests purposes only**, pre-releases (beta) versions are available in the [Experimental Plugin Site](https://updates.jenkins.io/#experimental-plugin-site) and development versions (incremental releases) are archived on every successful build on [our CI environment](https://ci.jenkins.io/job/Plugins/job/pipeline-maven-plugin/).

| 🔥 | **If you want to use the feature [Trigger downstream pipeline when a snapshot is built](#plugin-content-feature-trigger-downstream) it is critical to [setup a database](#plugin-content-db-setup)** as H2 is not preconfigured by default any more. **Using H2 might degrade your environment stability** (The H2 database is running in your instance JVM and could request too many resources). |
| --- | --- |

## Changelog

Release notes are recorded in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/releases).

## Usage

The Pipeline Maven Plugin works with Linux, Windows and MacOSX build agents.

Simple Maven build on a Linux agent.

```
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage("Build") {
      steps {
        git url: 'https://github.com/cyrille-leclerc/multi-module-maven-project'
        withMaven {
          sh "mvn clean verify"
        } // withMaven will discover the generated Maven artifacts, JUnit Surefire & FailSafe reports and FindBugs reports
      }
    }
  }
}
```

It can supports various parameters to fine-tune its behavior.

Within a node or a docker.image block, create a withMaven block to set up a `with maven` environment.

The configured environment will be used when calling maven inside the block by using `sh mvn` or `bat mvn`.

The following parameters can be used to configure Maven:

* **Maven** (`maven`): Allow the selection of a Maven installation configured on the Global Jenkins configuration or on the Global Tool Configuration page if using Jenkins > 2.0. When auto-install is enabled, maven will be downloaded and made available for the pipeline job.
* **JDK** (`jdk`): Allows the selection of a JDK installation. If auto-install is enabled, the JDK will be downloaded and made available for the pipeline job.
* **Maven Settings**

  + **Maven Settings Config** (`mavenSettingsConfig`): Select a Maven settings file **ID** from [Config File Provider Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider/) allowing the replacement of server credentials and variable substitutions as configured in [Config File Provider Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/config-file-provider-plugin). The settings' element in the `settings.xml` file contains elements used to define values which configure Maven execution in various ways, like the `pom.xml`, but should not be bundled to any specific project, or distributed to an audience. See also [settings.xml](http://maven.apache.org/settings.html) reference
  + **Maven Settings File Path** (`mavenSettingsFilePath`): Specify the path to a Maven `settings.xml` file on the build agent. The specified path can be absolute or relative to the workspace.
  + If none of `mavenSettingsConfig` and `mavenSettingsFilePath` are defined, `withMaven(){}` will use the Maven settings defined in the Jenkins Global Tool Configuration if declared
* **Maven Global Settings**

  + **Maven Global Settings Config** (`globalMavenSettingsConfig`): Select a Maven global settings file **ID** from [Config File Provider Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider/).
  + **Maven Global Settings File Path** (`globalMavenSettingsFilePath`): Specify the path to a Maven global `settings.xml` file on the build agent. The specified path can be absolute or relative to the workspace.
  + If none of `globalMavenSettingsConfig` and`globalMavenSettingsFilePath` are defined, `withMaven(){}` will use the Maven global settings defined in the Jenkins Global Tool Configuration if declared
* **Maven JVM Opts** (`mavenOpts`): Specify JVM specific options needed when launching Maven as an external process, these are not maven specific options. See: [Java Options](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/windows/java.html#CBBIJCHG)
   Shell-like environment variable expansions work in this field, by using the `${VARIABLE`} syntax.
* **Maven Local Repository** (`mavenLocalRepo`): Specify a custom local repository path. Shell-like environment variable expansions work with this field, by using the `${VARIABLE`} syntax. Normally, Jenkins uses the local Maven repository as determined by Maven, by default `~/.m2/repository` and can be overridden by `<localRepository>` in `~/.m2/settings.xml` (see Configuring your Local Repository))
   This normally means that all the jobs that are executed on the same node shares a single Maven repository. The upside of this is that you can save the disk space, the downside is that the repository is not multi process safe and having multiple builds run concurrently can corrupt it. Additionally, builds could interfere with each other by sharing incorrect or partially built artifacts. For example, you might end up having builds incorrectly succeed, just because your have all the dependencies in your local repository, despite that fact that none of the repositories in POM might have them.
   By using this option, Jenkins will tell Maven to use a custom path for the build as the local Maven repository by using `-Dmaven.repo.local`
   If specified as a relative path then this value will be resolved against the workspace root and not the current working directory.
   ie. `$WORKSPACE/.repository` if `.repository` value is specified.
* **Maven Traceability** (`traceability`): adds additional output to the maven wrapper script. Maven is executed with parameter `--show-version` and the start of the wrapper script is indicated by `----- withMaven Wrapper script -----`. Defaults to `false`.

| ❗ | `mavenSettingsConfig` and `globalMavenSettingsConfig` use the **ID**, not the **name**, of the Maven settings file (resp Maven Global Settings file). |
| --- | --- |

| 💡 | The Pipeline Syntax snippet code generator can be used to assist on generating the withMaven step parameters! |
| --- | --- |

More complex Maven build on a Windows agent.

```
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage("Build") {
      steps {
        git url: 'https://github.com/cyrille-leclerc/multi-module-maven-project'
        withMaven(
            // Maven installation declared in the Jenkins "Global Tool Configuration"
            maven: 'maven-3', // (1)
            // Use `$WORKSPACE/.repository` for local repository folder to avoid shared repositories
            mavenLocalRepo: '.repository', // (2)
            // Maven settings.xml file defined with the Jenkins Config File Provider Plugin
            // We recommend to define Maven settings.xml globally at the folder level using
            // navigating to the folder configuration in the section "Pipeline Maven Configuration / Override global Maven configuration"
            // or globally to the entire master navigating to  "Manage Jenkins / Global Tools Configuration"
            mavenSettingsConfig: 'my-maven-settings' // (3)
        ) {
          // Run the maven build
          sh "mvn clean verify"
        } // withMaven will discover the generated Maven artifacts, JUnit Surefire & FailSafe & FindBugs & SpotBugs reports...
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example the following parameters are used to configure Maven:

1. **maven:** 'maven-3' Maven Installation will be used, this installation has to be declared in the Global Jenkins configuration or Tool installations page.
2. **mavenLocalRepo:** a local repository folder is specified to avoid shared repositories
3. **mavenSettingsConfig:** specifies a specific settings.xml configuration from [Config File Provider Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/config-file-provider/), allowing the replacement of variables and credentials.

## Features

### Configurable as code

See demos on the [Configuration as Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/):

<https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/tree/master/demos/pipeline-maven>

### Sensible default Maven parameters

The Maven parameters that are useful on a build server, `--batch-mode` (`-B`) and `--no-transfer-progress` (`-ntp`) are enable by default, no need to add them in your mvn invocations.

if **[Traceability of Maven builds](#plugin-content-feature-traceability)** is enabled, `--no-transfer-progress` (`-ntp`) option is removed, and `--show-version` (`-V`) is added.

### Maven Settings Support

Please note this is NOT part of this plugin, this is the [Maven](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin/) plugin configuration, but we depend on it.

The `withMaven()` pipeline step will setup the Maven settings file and global settings file either explicitly using the attributes of the `withMaven(){}` step declaration or implicitly using the Maven Global Settings and Settings files defined at the folder level or in the Jenkins Global Tools Configuration.

Using implicit declaration, Jenkins administrators can simplify the work of pipeline authors hiding the "boilerplate" to declare the credentials of the Git, Nexus, Artifactory…​ servers and all the needed proxies, mirrors…​

### Traceability of Maven builds

By setting the parameter `traceability` to `true` (either globally on the tools configuration page, or for one step in particular), the `withMaven()` pipeline step will capture in the logs of the build all the details of the execution:

### Report Publishers

Maven build executions inside the `withMaven(){}` will be detected and Jenkins will transparently

* Archive and fingerprint generated Maven artifacts and Maven attached artifacts
* Publish JUnit / Surefire reports (if the [Jenkins JUnit Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/) is installed)
* Concordion test reports (since 3.0.0)
* And more (see below) …​

| ⚠️ | Deprecated publishers  * Publish Findbugs reports (if the [Jenkins FindBugs Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/findbugs/) is installed) * Publish a report of the tasks (`FIXME` and `TODO`) found in the java source code (if the [Jenkins Tasks Scanner Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/tasks/) is installed). |
| --- | --- |

| 💡 | In the future, deprecated publishers should be replaced by [Warnings Next Generation](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng/) implementations (See: [JENKINS-57427](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-57427)) |
| --- | --- |

| ℹ️ | The detection of Maven builds requires using Maven 3.2+. |
| --- | --- |

Generated Artifact

Archiving and the fingerprinting of the artifacts and attached artifacts generated by the Maven build (jar, sources jar, javadocs jar…​)

Generated JUnit reports

Requires [Jenkins JUnit Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit/). If the plugin is not installed, then the Maven report is ignored.

Publishing of the JUnit reports generated from the [Surefire](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/), [FailSafe](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-failsafe-plugin/), [Tycho](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/), [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/maven-karma-plugin) or [Frontend](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) plugins during the Maven build. Additionally, if [JUnit Attachments](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit-attachments/) or [Flaky Test Handler](https://plugins.jenkins.io/flaky-test-handler/) are installed, JUnits reports will be processed by these plugins. Except the Frontend one, all these plugins publish a `reportsDirectory` property which can be used to find and import JUnit compatible reports. The Frontend plugin has another behaviour, so for detection to work, you have to set a `REPORTS_DIRECTORY` environment variable to the plugin (and reuse it in your Karma configuration, to be consistent) :

```
   <plugin>
        <groupId>com.github.eirslett</groupId>
        <artifactId>frontend-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <executions>
            <execution>
                ...
                <configuration>
                    ...
                    <environmentVariables>
                        <REPORTS_DIRECTORY>${project.build.directory}/karma-reports</REPORTS_DIRECTORY>
                    </environmentVariables>
                </configuration>
            </execution>
        </executions>
    </plugin>
```

Generated Findbugs reports

Requires the deprecated [Jenkins FindBugs Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/findbugs/).

Publishing of the Findbugs reports generated by the Maven build

Tasks scanner report

Requires the deprecated [Jenkins Tasks Scanner Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/tasks/)

Publishing of a report of the “FIXME” and “TODO” tasks found in the java source code. The keywords can be configured.

Dependencies Fingerprinting (since 2.5.0)

Fingerprint the Maven dependencies. By default, only the snapshot dependencies of scope compile, runtime and provided are fingerprinted.

[Concordion](http://concordion.org/) test report (since 3.0.0)

Requires the [Jenkins HTML Publisher Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher/)

Publishing of the [Concordion](http://concordion.org/) test reports. Publish the Concordion reports generated by the `maven-surefire-plugin:test` and the `maven-failsafe-plugin:integration-test goals and located in the folder described by the system property `concordion.output.dir as documented in [Concordion > Integration > Java > Maven](http://concordion.org/integrations/java/html/#maven)

[Maven Invoker Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/) test reports

Publish test reports generated by the [maven-invoker-plugin:run](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/) goal

JGiven reports

Requires the [Jenkins JGiven Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jgiven/)

Publish [JGiven](http://jgiven.org/) test reports

JaCoCo Code Coverage

Requires the [Jenkins JaCoCo Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jacoco/)

Publish JaCoCo Code Coverage

Maven Linker Publisher

Publish the Maven report on the pipeline build GUI (list of dependencies, produced artifacts, downstream & upstream pipelines).
 This publisher should be renamed "Maven Build Report Publisher".
 A reason to disable this publisher is typically to not "pollute" the build screen with Maven invocations when Maven is used as a utility (e.g. invocations of "maven-help-plugin:3.2.0:evaluate"…​)

Pipeline Graph Publisher

Build the graph of dependencies between Jenkins pipelines and Maven artifacts in order to trigger downstream pipelines (when using the `snapshotDependencies` on downstream pipelines)

#### Implicit or Explicit activation of Publishers

By default, all the publishers are enabled by default.

It is possible to change the default activation of a publisher navigating to the `Global Tool Configuration` screen.

It is possible to disable the default activation of publishers on a specific `withMaven(){…​}` step using the `publisherStrategy='EXPLICIT'` attribute in the step `withMaven(publisherStrategy='EXPLICIT'){…​}`. The publishers can then be enabled explicitly in the `withMaven(){…​}` step using the "publishers" attribute.

It is possible to use a marker file to temporarily disable the feature for a specific Maven build. Typically, used to disable a reporter for a specific build that would generate too much data for the default configuration of the reporter (e.g. too many generated artifacts…​) or to workaround a bug in the “withMaven” waiting for a fix. These markers file must be located in the home directory of the build.

| Reporter | Configuration to disable the feature Since v2.3.0 | Marker file to disable the feature |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generated Artifact | `withMaven(options: [artifactsPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)`   Since 3.11.0 more fine granular options: `withMaven(options: [artifactsPublisher(fingerprintFilesDisabled: true, archiveFilesDisabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-archive-generated-artifacts` |
| Generated JUnit reports | `withMaven(options: [junitPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-publish-junit-results` |
| Generated Findbugs reports | `withMaven(options: [findbugsPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-publish-findbugs-results` |
| Tasks scanner report | `withMaven(options: [openTasksPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-task-scanner` |
| Dependencies Fingerprinting | `withMaven(options: [dependenciesFingerprintPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-fingerprint-maven-dependencies` |
| Concordion test report | `withMaven(options: [concordionPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)`` | `.skip-publish-concordion-results` |
| Maven Invoker Plugin test reports | `withMaven(options: [invokerPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-publish-invoker-run` |
| JGiven reports | `withMaven(options: [jgivenPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-publish-jgiven-results` |
| JaCoCo Code Coverage | `withMaven(options: [jacocoPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` |  |
| Maven Linker Publisher | `withMaven(options: [mavenLinkerPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `skip-maven-linker-publisher` |
| Pipeline Graph Publisher | `withMaven(options: [pipelineGraphPublisher(disabled: true)],…​)` | `.skip-pipeline-graph` |

### Trigger downstream pipeline when a snapshot is built

| ℹ️ | Available since version 3.0.0 |
| --- | --- |

Trigger downstream pipeline that depend on Maven artifact generated by upstream pipelines.

| ℹ️ | * The upstream artifact must be generated in a `withMaven(){}` wrapping step to be detected by the triggering system * The downstream pipeline must have selected the build trigger `Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built`    + The build trigger can be defined at the pipeline level (`Build Triggers`), at the multibranch pipeline level (`Scan Repository Triggers`) or at the GitHub Organization / Bitbucket Project level (`Scan Organizations Triggers`) * You have to manually trigger once the upstream pipeline, and the downstream pipeline so that the link between the pipelines based on the SNAPSHOT dependency is established * The dependency graph is, for the moment, optionally stored in an H2 embedded database (`$JENKINS_HOME/jenkins-jobs/jenkins-jobs.mv.db`). And there is support for PostgreSQL and MySql as well (see details below) |

* Thresholds are applied to define on which type of maven build the downstream pipelines are triggered

  + Threshold based on the status of the upstream pipeline (`success`, `unstable`, `failure`, `no build`, `aborted`). By default, only builds with a `success` result will trigger downstream builds. [![downstream pipeline trigger threshold build result](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/downstream-pipeline-trigger-threshold-build-result.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/downstream-pipeline-trigger-threshold-build-result.png)
  + Threshold based on the [Maven lifecycle phase](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html) reached in the Maven build of the upstream job (`package`, `install`, `deploy`). By default, only the maven builds who reach the `deploy` phase will trigger downstream builds. [![downstream pipeline trigger threshold lifecycle](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/downstream-pipeline-trigger-threshold-lifecycle.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/downstream-pipeline-trigger-threshold-lifecycle.png)

### Support of Maven Wrapper 'mvnw'

| ℹ️ | Available since version 3.0.3 |
| --- | --- |

The Pipeline Maven Plugin works with [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) 'mvnw'.

```
withMaven() {
   sh "./mvnw clean deploy"
}
```

## Adding more Maven Reporters

The API for Maven reporters is still experimental. Please open a Request for Enhancement Jira issue to discuss how to add Maven reporters.

We want to quickly add reporters for CheckStyle, Jacoco…​

## Database Setup

| ℹ️ | Available since version 1333.v333b\_b\_f053972 |
| --- | --- |

To use a database you must first install the `Pipeline Maven Plugin Database`

[![pipeline maven plugin database](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-database.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-database.png)

Have a look at the Tools configuration:

[![dao choice](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/dao-choice.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/dao-choice.png)

The make a choice in available DAOs options:

For Configuration as Code users, these are the field to add into their yaml file `daoClass` and `jdbcUrl`

### Using a MySQL Database

| ℹ️ | Available since version 3.6.0 |
| --- | --- |

The Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin relies on a database to store its data (list of dependencies and of generated artifacts of each build…​).

By default, the Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin uses an H2 embedded database, but it is recommend to use an external MySQL database.

Configuration steps to use a MySQL:

* Create an empty MySQL database with a dedicated MySQL user with permissions for Data Manipulation Language actions (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) actions

  + Tested with MySQL up to 8.1, with MariaDB up to 11.1 and with Amazon Aurora MySQL 5.6
* Install the Jenkins `MySQL Database` plugin

  + Navigate to `Manage Jenkins / Manage Plugins / Available`, select the `MySQL Database` plugin and click on `Download now and install after restart`
* Configure the Pipeline Maven Plugin to use the created MySQL database

  + Create Jenkins credentials for the MySQL connection navigating to `Credentials` on the left menu
  + Navigate to `Manage Jenkins / Global Tools Configuration` and go to the `Pipeline Maven Configuration` [![pipeline maven plugin configuration 1](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-configuration-1.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-configuration-1.png)
  + In the Database configuration section, define the following.

    - JDBC URL: url of the database, e.g. `jdbc:mysql://mysql.example.com/jenkins`
    - JDBC Credentials: select the credentials of the MySQL database.
    - The [parameters recommended by the Hikari Connection Pool team](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/wiki/MySQL-Configuration) are used by default for the MySQL connections and for the datasource (max pool size:10, server side prepared statements cache with 250 entries…​). To overwrite these defaults, click on the `Advanced Database Configuration` button.
  + Click on `Validate Database Configuration` button to verify that the connection is successful.
  + Click on `Save`. [![pipeline maven plugin configuration 2](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-configuration-2.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-configuration-2.png)

### Using a PostgreSQL Database

| ℹ️ | Available since version 3.7.0 |
| --- | --- |

The Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin relies on a database to store its data (list of dependencies and of generated artifacts of each build…​).

By default, the Jenkins Pipeline Maven Plugin uses an H2 embedded database, but it is recommended to use an external PostgreSQL or MySQL / MariaDB database.

Configuration steps to use a PostgreSQL:

* Create an empty PostgreSQL database with a dedicated PostgreSQL user with permissions for Data Manipulation Language actions (DML) and Data Definition Language (DDL) actions

  + Tested with PostgreSQL up to 16
* Install the Jenkins the [PostgreSQL API](https://plugins.jenkins.io/postgresql-api/) plugin

  + Navigate to `Manage Jenkins / Manage Plugins / Available`, select the `PostgreSQL API` plugin and click on `Download now and install after restart`.
* Configure the Pipeline Maven Plugin to use the created PostgreSQL database

  + Create Jenkins credentials for the PostgreSQL connection navigating to `Credentials` on the left menu
  + Navigate to `Manage Jenkins / Global Tools Configuration` and go to the `Pipeline Maven Configuration` [![pipeline maven plugin configuration postgresql](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin@master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-configuration-postgresql.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/pipeline-maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/pipeline-maven-plugin-configuration-postgresql.png)
  + In the Database configuration section, define the following

    - JDBC URL: url of the database, e.g. `jdbc:postgresql://postgresql.example.com:5432/jenkins
    - JDBC Credentials: select the credentials of the PostgreSQL database
    - The underlying datasource, [HikariCP](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP), comes with sensible default configuration values (see [here](https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP#configuration-knobs-baby)). To overwrite these defaults, click on the `Advanced Database Configuration` button.
  + Click on `Validate Database Configuration` button to verify that the connection is successful.
  + Click on `Save`.
  + Navigate to `Manage Jenkins / Global Tools Configuration` and go to the `Pipeline Maven Configuration` to verify that the database connection is successful, and the database tables have been created (see screenshot above).

## Known Limitations

### Maven and JDK installation not supported in `docker.image('xxx').inside{…​}`

Maven and JDK installers do not work with `docker.image('xxx').inside{…​}` as the docker step does not allow the use of Tool Installer, the preinstalled Maven and JDK on the docker image will be auto-discovered and used.

### `withMaven()` not supported in `docker.image('xxx').inside{…​}` with old versions of the Docker engine

`withMaven()` not supported in `docker.image('xxx').inside{…​}` with old versions of the Docker engine such as Docker 1.13.1 on CentOS7.

Any help to fix this bug is more than welcome.

* [Gitea
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitea)
* [InfluxDB
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/influxdb)

## Descriptions

### Persisted XSS vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1373
/
CVE-2019-10325**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages.
This allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Warnings Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings parser names.

### CSRF vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1391
/
CVE-2019-10326**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning counts for future builds.

Warnings Plugin now requires that these requests be sent via POST.

### XML External Entity processing vulnerability in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1409
/
CVE-2019-10327**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-maven`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-maven)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

### Unsafe entry in Script Security list of approved signatures in Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin

**SECURITY-921
/
CVE-2019-10328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-remote-loader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-remote-loader)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom list of pre-approved signatures for Script Security.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe pre-approved entry has been removed.

### InfluxDB Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1403
/
CVE-2019-10329**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`influxdb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/influxdb)**

**Description:**

InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

### Improper handling of untrusted branches in Gitea Plugin

**SECURITY-1046
/
CVE-2019-10330**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitea`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitea)**

**Description:**

Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior.
Attackers without commit access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull request content when those are trusted.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Artifactory Plugin allow capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1015 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in Artifactory Plugin
