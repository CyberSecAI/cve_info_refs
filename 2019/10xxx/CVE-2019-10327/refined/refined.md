Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10327:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not properly configure its XML parser, leaving it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper XML parser configuration
- XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to:
- Extract secrets from the Jenkins master
- Conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks
- Initiate denial-of-service (DoS) attacks

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker needs to control the contents of a temporary directory on the agent where the Maven build executes. They would introduce a malicious XML file containing external entities. This file would be parsed by Jenkins, leading to the exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Job/Configure permissions.
- The attacker needs to be able to control the content of a temporary directory on the agent executing the Maven build.

**Additional details:**
The fix involves configuring the plugin to no longer process XML External Entities in XML documents.
