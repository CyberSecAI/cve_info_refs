- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `/news/*.html` page, allowing for SQL injection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the database, extract sensitive data, modify database content, or execute arbitrary commands on the database server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL by appending a SQL injection payload to the `/news/*.html` page, where * represents any existing page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. They also need knowledge of SQL injection techniques and be able to use tools like `sqlmap`.
