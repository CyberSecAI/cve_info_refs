- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Email Address" field within the "My Account" section.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Self-Cross-Site Scripting (Self-XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The injected malicious script executes within the victim's browser, in the context of their session. This could allow an attacker to potentially perform actions on behalf of the user, or to gather sensitive information visible to the logged in user. Since this is a self-xss, this requires the attacker to trick the user into pasting malicious code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker inputs a malicious payload into the "Email Address" field in the "My Account" section and then submits the form.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user to modify the "My Account" settings. They would also require the user to paste their malicious code into the specified input field.
