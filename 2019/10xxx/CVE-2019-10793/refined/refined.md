  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `set` function in the `dot-object` library allows modification of properties on `Object.prototype` due to a lack of input sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Prototype Pollution"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can modify the `Object.prototype` which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) or other unexpected behavior in applications using the library.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a malicious path with a `__proto__` payload to the `set` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control the input to the `set` function of the `dot-object` library."
