Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10224:

**Description of the Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability involves the disclosure of sensitive information, such as the Directory Manager password, when the `dscreate` and `dsconf` commands in 389-ds-base are executed in verbose mode. This occurs because the password is printed to stderr. An attacker who can view the screen or capture the terminal's standard error output could exploit this flaw to gain confidential information.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the printing of the Directory Manager password to the standard error output when the `dscreate` and `dsconf` commands are run in verbose mode. This information is included in the debug logs.

**Attack Vector:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to observe the output of the `dscreate` or `dsconf` commands when run with the `-v` (verbose) option. This could involve:
    *   Directly viewing the screen where the commands are executed.
    *   Capturing the standard error output of the commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain the Directory Manager password, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control over the directory service.

**Affected Software:**

*   389-ds-base

**Mitigation:**

The vulnerability is fixed by masking sensitive attributes, such as passwords, from the logging output.

**Fix Information:**

*   The fix involves modifying the code to redact sensitive information from the logs.
*   Specifically, the `nsslapd-rootpw` attribute is masked during modification.
*   The fix was included in version 389-ds-base 1.4.1.3.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was also reported on Fedora.
*   The issue was cloned to Github and is available [here](https://github.com/389ds/389-ds-base/issues/3310).
