Package        : 389-ds-base
Version        : 1.4.0.21-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-3883 CVE-2019-10224 CVE-2019-14824 CVE-2021-3514
                 CVE-2021-3652 CVE-2021-4091 CVE-2022-0918 CVE-2022-0996
                 CVE-2022-2850

Multiple security issues were discovered in 389-ds-base: an open source LDAP
server for Linux.

CVE-2019-3883

    SSL/TLS requests do not enforce ioblocktimeout limit, leading to DoS
    vulnerability by hanging all workers with hanging LDAP requests.

CVE-2019-10224

    The vulnerability may disclose sensitive information, such as the Directory
    Manager password, when the dscreate and dsconf commands are executed in
    verbose mode. An attacker who can view the screen or capture the terminal
    standard error output can exploit thisvulnerability to obtain confidential information.

CVE-2019-14824

    The 'deref' plugin of 389-ds-base has a vulnerability that enables it to
    disclose attribute values using the 'search' permission. In certain setups,
    an authenticated attacker can exploit this flaw to access confidential
    attributes, including password hashes.

CVE-2021-3514

    If a sync_repl client is used, an authenticated attacker can trigger a crash
    by exploiting a specially crafted query that leads to a NULL pointer
    dereference.

CVE-2021-3652

    Importing an asterisk as password hashes enables successful authentication
    with any password, allowing attackers to access accounts with disabled
    passwords.

CVE-2021-4091

    A double free was found in the way 389-ds-base handles virtual attributes
    context in persistent searches. An attacker could send a series of search
    requests, forcing the server to behave unexpectedly, and crash.

CVE-2022-0918

    An unauthenticated attacker with network access to the LDAP port can cause a
    denial of service. The denial of service is triggered by a single message
    sent over a TCP connection, no bind or other authentication is required. The
    message triggers a segmentation fault that results in slapd crashing.

CVE-2022-0996

    Expired password was still allowed to access the database. A user whose
    password was expired was still allowed to access the database as if the
    password was not expired.  Once a password is expired, and "grace logins"
    have been used up, the account is basically supposed to be locked out and
    should not be allowed to perform any privileged action.

CVE-2022-2850

    The vulnerability in content synchronization plugin enables an authenticated attacker to trigger a denial of service via a crafted query through a NULL
    pointer dereference.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.0.21-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your 389-ds-base packages.

RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

#### #50251 dscreate and dsconf print DM's password in verbose mode Closed: wontfix 5 years ago by mreynolds. Opened 5 years ago by mhonek.

Closed: wontfix
Reopen Issue

#### Issue Description

When dscreate is executed in verbose mode, it prints Directory Manager's password to stderr. The same happens with dsconf when I change the password.

#### Package Version and Platform

389-ds-base-1.4.0.19-2.

#### Steps to reproduce

1. dscreate -v interactive
2. dsconf -v localhost directory\_manager password\_change

#### Actual results

```
$ dscreate -v interactive
...
DEBUG: cn=config set REPLACE: ('nsslapd-rootpw', 'Directory_Manager_Password')

$ dsconf -v localhost directory_manager password_change
...
Enter new directory manager password :
CONFIRM - Enter new directory manager password :
DEBUG: cn=config set REPLACE: ('nsslapd-rootpw', 'new_password')

```
#### Expected results

Actual value should not be printed in the debug logs. Python logging module supports filters that should be used to redact sensitive information from the logs

So I think a way to fix this could be in DSLdapObject inside the set function, we can say "if field in <sensitive dataset>" then we display **\*** instead - but in DEBUGGING=True maybe we still display it?

I'm thinking of having a class variable `DSLdapObject._sensitive_attributes: List[str]` and using it wherever required (for now in `DSLdapObject.set()`). And yes, `DEBUGGING=True` should override this.

[@mhonek](https://pagure.io/user/mhonek) I think this seems like a good approach. I would have done the same, have a class variable of that signature, and then to use it to filter or replace the content with \*\*\*\* or similar.

One thing I thought I put down but seemingly haven't, was that in the simplest implementation case, we should have a method, e.g. `DSLdapObject.display_attr_value(attr, value, hide_sensitive=True)` that would handle the displaying and would be used where necessary; that in order to have consistent behaviour across our library. Something like...

```
def display_attr_value(self, attr, value, hide_sesitive=True):
    if DEBUGGING or hide_sensitive:
        return value
    else:
        if attr.lower() in self._sensitive_attributes:
            return '********'
        else:
            return value

```

[@mhonek](https://pagure.io/user/mhonek) Another option is to wrap / over-load the str/unicode method on the str we return. But that could be complex ....
