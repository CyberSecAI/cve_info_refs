- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of encrypted communication in SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7 systems. When "Encrypted Communication" is not enabled, an attacker can exploit this weakness.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is the absence of encrypted communication, which allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected device. An attacker can execute arbitrary code, leading to potential data breaches, system manipulation, and denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device. No authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability, nor does it require user interaction.
