SUMMARY

A vulnerability was identiﬁed in SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7, which could allow an unauthenti-
cated attacker with access to the affected devices to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability can be
exploited if the affected systems do not have “Encrypted Communication” enabled.

Siemens provides versions of SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7, that allow to enable a mode called
“Encrypted Communication”, which mitigates the vulnerability.

“Encrypted communication” is enabled by default starting with SIMATIC WinCC V7.5.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC and other components.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10922

An attacker with network access to affected installations, which are conﬁgured without “Encrypted
Communication”, can execute arbitrary code.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access
to the affected installation. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. The
vulnerability impacts conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
