The provided content relates to CVE-2019-10630.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2019-10630 - Plaintext Admin Password

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is not explicitly described but can be inferred that the system stores or transmits administrator passwords in plaintext. The blog post mentions this in the context of exploiting CVE-2019-10632, stating "the ability to move ANY file on the NAS...database files, configuration files or plaintext passwords (**CVE-2019-10630**) to gain elevation". This indicates that sensitive files, potentially containing plaintext credentials, can be accessed through the arbitrary file-share moving vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Plaintext Storage of Credentials**: The system stores the admin password in a manner that allows for it to be read in plaintext when the appropriate configuration or data files are accessed.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls**: Lack of proper access controls on sensitive configuration or data files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Full System Compromise:** An attacker could gain full control of the NAS device by obtaining the administrator's credentials.
*   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to stored data on the NAS, which could include sensitive personal or business information.
*   **Privilege Escalation**: Moving a file containing the plaintext password can give unauthorized users access to admin privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Arbitrary File Move (CVE-2019-10632):** An attacker exploits the file moving vulnerability to move sensitive files containing the admin password to a location where they can access it.
*   **Access to System Files**: Once the file is moved to an accessible location, the attacker can directly read the file to get the plaintext admin password.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User**: The attacker needs to have access to the web interface of the NAS.
*   **Knowledge of File Path:** The attacker needs to know the location or name of the file that contains the plaintext admin password.
*   **Vulnerability exploitation**: The attacker needs to be able to successfully exploit CVE-2019-10632 to move the necessary file.

**Additional Details (from the blog post):**
*   The vulnerability is not directly exploitable as a standalone bug, but is a consequence of the file-share moving vulnerability (CVE-2019-10632).
*   The file containing the plaintext admin password is not directly accessible via directory traversal or similar vulnerabilities, due to proper access control. It becomes accessible through the exploitation of CVE-2019-10632.
*   The blog post indicates that the device stores sensitive information, including potential passwords, in accessible files on the filesystem.
