Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `compile-sass` npm package, specifically in the `setupCleanupOnExit(cssPath)` function within `dist/index.js`. This function executes a `rm -r ${cssPath}` command to remove files without properly sanitizing the `cssPath` input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of sanitization of the `cssPath` allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the `rm` command executed by the `exec()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system where the `compile-sass` package is used. This could lead to a wide range of impacts including, but not limited to, data theft, system compromise, and denial of service.
*   The provided PoC shows how to create a file named "JHU.txt" on the system by injecting the command '& touch JHU.txt'.
*   High impact on confidentiality, low impact on integrity and no impact on availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `cssPath` argument passed to the `setupCleanupOnExit()` function. This argument is not sanitized before being used in the `exec` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to control the `cssPath` argument passed to `setupCleanupOnExit()` function. The attacker needs to be able to run code that uses the vulnerable `compile-sass` module and to influence the parameters of this code.
*   The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in version 1.0.5 of the `compile-sass` package.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by JHU System Security Lab.
*   Snyk assigned the ID SNYK-JS-COMPILESASS-551804 to this vulnerability.
* The CVSS score was evaluated as 8.2 High
*   The fix involves not using the user-provided `cssPath` directly in a shell command, or sanitizing the input to prevent injection
