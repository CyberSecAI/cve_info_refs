# Metadata (e.g. EXIF) should be stripped from images used as project/group images

**[HackerOne report #446238](https://hackerone.com/reports/446238)** by ghjfgjggfdfhfgsdfssdf on 2018-11-17:

**Summary:** When uploading JPEG images as group logos on Gitlab, the EXIF metadata is not removed or changed in any way.

**Description:** When setting up a group on Gitlab, you can upload a logo, and if you upload a JPEG with EXIF metadata on it, it isn't stripped. This can lead to disclosure of location where photo was taken or other personal information by the photo uploader if their group is public, as anyone can download the logo and check the metadata.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Upload a testing image w any EXIF tags filled in (you can test with the attached download.jpg image on this report)
2. Make the group public
3. Visit the group page unauthenticated and download the image
4. Use Windows properties tool or any EXIF viewer, check the metadata. Whatever was there when uploaded should be there when downloaded, including the exact file name (though the file name part isn't an actual reportable problem, it's good practice to just encode/make it a random file name in case the user uploading forgets to remove personal information in the file name)

## PoC

Check out my group: <https://gitlab.com/gthgh>
Try downloading the logo. The metadata for it should show "egginfo" under Copyright.

## Impact

An attacker could download public group logos and find sensitive metadata. Some phones attach metadata with the latitude/longitude of where the photo was taken which could leak important information, and it's just best practice as well to strip all metadata from images when uploaded.

## Attachments

**Warning:** Attachments received through HackerOne, please exercise caution!

# EXIF Geolocation Data Not Stripped From Uploaded Images

**[HackerOne report #463654](https://hackerone.com/reports/463654)** by rgupt on 2018-12-17:

**Summary:**
When a user uploads an image in Gitlab, the uploaded image's EXIF Geolocation Data does not gets stripped. As a result, anyone can get sensitive information of Gitlab's users like their Geolocation, their Device information like Device Name, Version, Software & Software version used etc.

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. Login to Gitlab and upload an image for any of the features like:

* Create a New Issue
* Create a New Comment
* Create a New Snippet etc...

2. Upload an image which has EXIF Geolocation Data in it. Please use the following POC file:
   <https://gitlab.com/rgupta1/testing2/uploads/c11e11ce3f02031fe600dc847293a851/IMG_20181217_122953951.jpg>
3. Once the image is uploaded by Gitlab and hosted on Gitlab server, download the image file and check the File Properties. You can also use a tool like to view user's information:
   <https://www.pic2map.com/>

## POC

I have created a Private Project and uploaded an attachment to reproduce this issue. Please checkout the image in this link:
<https://gitlab.com/rgupta1/testing2/issues/1>

## Impact

This vulnerability is CRITICAL and impacts all the Gitlab's customer base. This vulnerability violates the privacy of a User and shares sensitive information of the user who uploads an image on Gitlab or any of the Gitlab instances.

## Dependency

This fix should be released together with <https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/56922> which addresses EXIF removal for existing uploads. It also depends on <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/omnibus-gitlab/merge_requests/99>.

Downstream link issue: <https://dev.gitlab.org/gitlab/gitlab-workhorse/issues/3>
