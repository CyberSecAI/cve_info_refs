Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, which relate to the lack of EXIF data stripping in GitLab:

**Vulnerability 1:**
* **Root Cause:** GitLab fails to remove EXIF metadata from JPEG images uploaded as group logos.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of sanitization of uploaded images, specifically regarding EXIF metadata.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Disclosure of potentially sensitive information embedded in the EXIF metadata, such as location data (latitude/longitude), camera information, and other personal data of the uploader.
* **Attack Vectors:** Uploading a JPEG image with EXIF metadata as a group logo.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker can be unauthenticated user and can access a public group page to download the logo.

**Vulnerability 2:**

* **Root Cause:** GitLab does not strip EXIF geolocation data from images uploaded through various features (issues, comments, snippets, etc.).
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of sanitization of uploaded images, specifically regarding EXIF geolocation data.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Leakage of sensitive user information such as geolocation data, device information (device name, version, software used).
* **Attack Vectors:** Uploading an image with EXIF geolocation data through any of GitLab's features that allow image uploads.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker can be authenticated and able to access the issue/comment/snippet where the image was uploaded.

**Summary of Both Vulnerabilities:**

Both reports highlight the same fundamental issue: GitLab does not properly sanitize uploaded images by removing EXIF metadata, which can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information. The first report focuses specifically on group logos, while the second report expands the scope to include images uploaded via other features, emphasizing the broader impact. Both reports highlight the potential for location data leakage.

It's also important to note that the second report explicitly mentions that the fix should be released in conjunction with other related issues addressing EXIF removal for existing uploads and backend changes. This indicates the issue is not just limited to new uploads but also applies to past uploads.
