CVE-2019-10964:

- Vulnerability: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
- Root cause: The affected insulin pumps communicate wirelessly using RF, but the communication protocol lacks proper authentication and authorization.
- Affected products: Medtronic MiniMed 508 and Paradigm Series Insulin Pumps
- Impact: An attacker with adjacent access can intercept, modify, or interfere with wireless RF communications. This could lead to reading sensitive data, changing pump settings, or controlling insulin delivery (potentially causing hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis).
- Attack vector: Exploiting the lack of authentication/authorization in the wireless RF communication protocol. Adjacent access is required.
- Required attacker capabilities: An attacker needs adjacent access and a high skill level to exploit the vulnerability by injecting, replaying, modifying, and/or intercepting data.
