{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-10773",
    "description": "The package install functionality in Yarn before 1.21.1 can be abused to generate arbitrary symlinks on the host filesystem by using specially crafted \"bin\" keys. Existing files could be overwritten depending on the current user permission set.",
    "affected_components": [
      "nodejs-yarn"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper validation of paths specified in the 'bin' field of a package's package.json file, allowing for symlinks to be created outside of the intended scope.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary symlink creation",
      "Potential file overwrite"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could create arbitrary symlinks leading to potential overwriting of existing files, potentially impacting system confidentiality, integrity, and availability.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector involves crafting a malicious package with specially crafted \"bin\" keys in the package.json file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to publish a malicious package to a repository where it can be installed using Yarn.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability is fixed in Yarn 1.21.1 by validating the 'bin' entries and ensuring they only reference files within the package and that their names are valid file names. The fix also normalizes the target paths. The issue is similar to vulnerabilities found in npm and pnpm related to binary planting and arbitrary file overwrite."
