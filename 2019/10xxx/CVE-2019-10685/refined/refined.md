{
  "cveId": "CVE-2019-10685",
  "vulnerabilities": [
    {
      "rootCause": "The application reflects user-supplied input without proper sanitization, leading to the execution of injected JavaScript code.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including session hijacking, stealing cookies, defacing the website, and redirecting the victim to malicious websites.",
      "attackVectors": [
        "The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted GET request to `/am/Login,loginForm.sdirect` with a malicious payload in the `TextField` parameter."
      ],
      "requiredCapabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and trick a user into clicking on it. No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
      "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability occurs because the application echoes the user-supplied input from the `TextField` parameter within JavaScript code in an HTML response. This allows the injected JavaScript to execute when the page is loaded."
    }
