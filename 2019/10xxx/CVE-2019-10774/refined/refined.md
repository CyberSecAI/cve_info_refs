{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-10774",
    "root_cause": "User input is concatenated with a command within `addArg()` that will be executed without any check.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "Total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network. The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable at the protocol level one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack. Exploitation can occur without any user interaction."
