Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10360:

**CVE Description:**

The Maven Release Plug-in for Jenkins did not properly escape variables in multiple views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The plugin failed to sanitize user-controlled input, specifically variables used in view displays, before rendering them in the user interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting flaw. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the plugin's views by an attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution in user browser:** When a user accesses a view with the malicious script, the attacker's code is executed within their browser session.
*   **Session hijacking:** An attacker could potentially steal user session cookies.
*   **Credential theft:** Attackers could attempt to steal credentials, although this is less direct for stored XSS than it is for reflected XSS.
*   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the page viewed by other users.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious input via configuration:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts by crafting input that is not escaped by the plugin. Specifically, variables used in multiple views are not escaped, creating an attack vector.
*   **User interaction:** The attack requires a user to access a view where the malicious code is stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Jenkins user account:** An attacker needs to have a Jenkins user account with permissions to configure jobs, specifically related to the Maven Release Plugin, so that they can inject malicious input in the vulnerable fields.
*   **Ability to configure the Maven Release plugin:** The attacker needs the ability to configure the Maven Release Plugin settings to inject the malicious code.
*   **Victim interaction:** A separate user needs to view the compromised page for the malicious code to execute in their browser.
