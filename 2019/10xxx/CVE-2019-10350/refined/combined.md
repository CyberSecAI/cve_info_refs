---

SECURITY-1010 / CVE-2019-10340 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10341 (permission check)
Docker Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1400 / CVE-2019-10342
Docker Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users
configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1419 / CVE-2019-10346
Embeddable Build Status Plugin did not sanitize arguments provided in the
query string, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-775 / CVE-2019-10347
Mashup Portlets Plugin stored SonarQube credentials unencrypted on the
Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access to
the master file system.

SECURITY-1438 / CVE-2019-10348
Gogs Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on the
Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1177 / CVE-2019-10349
Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin does not correctly escape the Display Name
value for jobs in Jenkins, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1441 / CVE-2019-10350
Port Allocator Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml
files on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1437 / CVE-2019-10351
Caliper CI Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Docker Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1010
/
CVE-2019-10340 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10341 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`docker-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin)**

**Description:**

Docker Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer or Item/Configure permission, as appropriate.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in Docker Plugin

**SECURITY-1400
/
CVE-2019-10342**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`docker-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin)**

**Description:**

Docker Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires the appropriate permission, typically Overall/Administer or Item/Configure.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Embeddable Build Status Plugin

**SECURITY-1419
/
CVE-2019-10346**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`embeddable-build-status`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/embeddable-build-status)**

**Description:**

Gogs Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin

**SECURITY-1177
/
CVE-2019-10349**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
