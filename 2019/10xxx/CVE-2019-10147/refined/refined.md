Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-10147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper cgroup isolation for processes spawned using the `rkt enter` command in the rkt container runtime environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Processes started with `rkt enter` are not confined by cgroups during stage 2.
-  This allows the processes to bypass resource limitations enforced by cgroups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Compromised containers can potentially access and consume excessive host resources, leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
-  May lead to privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**
-  An attacker with control over a container can use `rkt enter` to execute processes outside the container's resource limitations.
-  `rkt enter` is used to execute processes directly within the container's environment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over a container running with `rkt`.
- The attacker needs the ability to execute commands within the container.
- The attacker would require the ability to utilize `rkt enter`

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Yuval Avrahami (Twistlock).
- The issue is described as affecting "fedora-all."
- The Red Hat Bugzilla entry for this CVE is for informational purposes as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.
