The provided content relates to CVE-2019-10231.

Based on the provided information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Type juggling in authentication

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from how the application handles type comparisons during the authentication process. Specifically, it seems that the application doesn't perform strict type checking, allowing for type juggling to potentially bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism. This would allow unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through manipulation of data provided during the authentication process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to interact with the authentication process, providing manipulated data. This likely means the attacker is in a position to access the application's login page.
