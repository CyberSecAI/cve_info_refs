Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10409:

**CVE-2019-10409: Missing permission check in Project Inheritance Plugin**

*   **Root Cause:** The Project Inheritance Plugin lacked a proper permission check on the HTTP endpoint responsible for creating projects based on predefined templates.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The HTTP endpoint for project creation did not verify if the user had the necessary privileges (Item/Create).
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The endpoint accepted GET requests, which made it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It should have required POST requests to prevent this.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with the `Overall/Read` permission could create projects using the plugin's template functionality even without the required `Item/Create` permission. This could allow unauthorized users to create potentially malicious or unwanted projects.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker could exploit the missing permission check by crafting a malicious request that triggers the project creation endpoint, allowing them to create projects without appropriate authorization.
    *   An attacker could leverage the CSRF vulnerability by tricking an authenticated user into unknowingly submitting a malicious GET request that creates a project using a template defined in the plugin's configuration.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a Jenkins user with at least the `Overall/Read` permission.
    *   The attacker needs to have knowledge of the vulnerable endpoint in the Project Inheritance Plugin to craft the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix implemented requires the `Item/Create` permission and the use of POST requests for project creation via the HTTP endpoint.
*   The vulnerability was found in the Project Inheritance Plugin.
*   The Project Inheritance Plugin allows the creation of projects based on templates defined in the plugin configuration.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in version 19.08.02 of the Project Inheritance Plugin.
