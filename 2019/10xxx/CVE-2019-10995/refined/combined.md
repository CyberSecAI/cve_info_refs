ABB recommends users apply the BSP update on affected CP600 control panels at their earliest convenience.

* [New version of PB610 Panel Builder 600 v2.8.0.424, which is provided via Automation Builder 2.2 SP2](http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=9AKK107492A4167&LanguageCode=de&LanguageCode=en&LanguageCode=es&LanguageCode=fr&LanguageCode=zh&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch).
* [New version of BSP (board support package) UN30 v2.31](http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=BSPCP600UN30V231&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch).

Please see ABB cybersecurity advisory document number [3ADR010402](https://library.e.abb.com/public/b2edb894b46242fda29eb7644a068161/ABB-Advisory_3ADR010402.pdf) for more information about this vulnerability and two other security issues and their mitigations.

NCCIC recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

•    Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).

•    Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.

•    When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

•    Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.

•    Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.

•    Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

•    Only use software from trusted sources.

NCCIC reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

NCCIC also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/content/recommended-practices) on the ICS-CERT web page. Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS-CERT website](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to NCCIC for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
