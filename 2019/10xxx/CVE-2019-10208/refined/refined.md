{
  "CVE-2019-10208": {
    "Description": "A flaw was discovered in postgresql where arbitrary SQL statements can be executed given a suitable SECURITY DEFINER function. An attacker, with EXECUTE permission on the function, can execute arbitrary SQL as the owner of the function.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an inexact argument type match during function calls within a SECURITY DEFINER function. This allows the attacker to use CREATE DOMAIN to create a type in a pg_temp schema, leading to arbitrary SQL execution.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Inexact argument type matching during function calls within a SECURITY DEFINER function.",
      "Ability to create objects in the pg_temp schema.",
          "Lack of proper validation and sanitization for function arguments.",
          "Insufficient privilege checks in certain operations."
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with `EXECUTE` permission on a vulnerable `SECURITY DEFINER` function can execute arbitrary SQL as the owner of that function, potentially gaining elevated privileges and full access to the database and the underlying system.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to have the `EXECUTE` permission on a specially crafted `SECURITY DEFINER` function which contains an inexact argument type matching. The attacker uses `CREATE DOMAIN` to create a type in the pg_temp schema.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to have `EXECUTE` privileges on a vulnerable `SECURITY DEFINER` function. The attacker also needs to be able to create a foreign server object with selected connection parameters or have access to a dblink function."
