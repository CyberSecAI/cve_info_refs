Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10288:

**CVE-2019-10288**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Jabber Server Plugin stores credentials (likely usernames and passwords or API keys) in plain text within its global configuration file on the Jenkins master.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** Credentials are not encrypted, making them easily accessible.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Unauthorized users who have access to the Jenkins master's file system can obtain the Jabber server credentials.
    *   **Potential for Further Compromise:** Exposed credentials could be used to gain access to the Jabber server and potentially other systems if the credentials are reused.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker needs access to the Jenkins master server's file system. This could be achieved through various means like:
        *   Compromising the server directly.
        *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities in Jenkins or the underlying operating system.
        *   Gaining access through stolen credentials.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must have the ability to browse the Jenkins master server's filesystem. This often requires administrator or root access.

**Summary**

The vulnerability lies in the insecure storage of Jabber server credentials within the plugin's configuration file. This lack of encryption exposes sensitive information to anyone with access to the Jenkins master's filesystem.

**Additional Details:**

*   The specific configuration file is `de.e_nexus.jabber.JabberBuilder.xml`.
*   The advisory indicates a "Low" severity rating for this vulnerability, likely due to the need for local file system access.
*   There is no fix available for the plugin as of the advisory publication.
