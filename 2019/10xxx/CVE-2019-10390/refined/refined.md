Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10390:

**Root Cause:**
The Splunk plugin for Jenkins had a form validation endpoint that compiled user-submitted Groovy scripts without proper sandbox protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unsandboxed Groovy Compilation:** The core issue was the lack of a secure sandbox environment when compiling user-provided Groovy scripts.
- **Form Validation Endpoint:** A specific HTTP endpoint designed for validating user input was vulnerable.
- **Missing Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to sanitize or restrict the allowed Groovy syntax, allowing malicious code injection through AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) transformations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master by leveraging the unsandboxed Groovy compilation. This includes using AST transforming annotations like `@Grab` to fetch and execute external code.
- **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete takeover of the Jenkins master, potentially affecting all connected build agents and the entire CI/CD pipeline.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Endpoint:** The vulnerability was triggered via a specific HTTP endpoint in the Splunk plugin used for validating Groovy scripts.
- **Malicious Groovy Script:** The attacker injects malicious code into a Groovy script.
- **AST Transformations:** The injected code utilizes AST transforming annotations such as @Grab to load and execute code from external sources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Overall/Read Access:** The attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance. This allows them to access and manipulate the form validation endpoint.
- **Ability to Craft Groovy Script:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Groovy script containing the necessary AST transforming annotations and code to be executed on the Jenkins master.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Splunk Plugin versions up to and including 1.7.4.
- The fix is included in Splunk Plugin version 1.8.0, which implements a safe Groovy compiler configuration, preventing unsafe AST transforming annotations.
- The advisory classifies the severity as High
