Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10998:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that physical access to the SD card of the AXC F 2152 PLC allows for manipulation of the data stored on it. This manipulation can lead to an authentication bypass of the device. The design of the device allows for easy replacement of the SD card to facilitate fast hardware replacement in industrial applications, however, this convenience also creates a security risk when physical access to the device and its SD card is not adequately controlled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Physical Security:** The primary weakness is the lack of sufficient physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the PLC's SD card. The system is designed to allow easy SD card swapping for operational reasons, which unintentionally facilitates unauthorized access when the physical security isn't in place.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** Manipulating the data on the SD card can allow an attacker to bypass the device's authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows unlimited access to the PLC.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate data stored on the SD card, potentially leading to the modification of program logic, configuration settings, and other critical data.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  The most critical impact is the ability to bypass the device's authentication, leading to complete control of the PLC.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector is physical access to the PLC device, specifically access to the SD card slot. This access enables an attacker to remove and modify the SD card contents.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Physical Access:** The attacker needs physical access to the PLC device to access the SD card slot.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to manipulate the data on the SD card to bypass the device's authentication. No advanced technical skills appear to be needed beyond this.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document suggests mitigation strategies such as physical access restrictions (locked cabinets) and monitoring SD card exchanges, as well as disabling SD card usage in the device via web-based management.
*   The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue with a CVSS base score of 6.8.
*   The advisory provides a temporary fix by following the instructions about the SD card usage in the user manual and a permanent fix via firmware update.
