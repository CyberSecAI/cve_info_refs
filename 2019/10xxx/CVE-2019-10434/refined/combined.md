SECURITY-1579 / CVE-2019-10431
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
default parameter expressions in constructors.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1590 / CVE-2019-10432
HTML Publisher Plugin did not escape the project or build display name
shown in the frame HTML page. This resulted in a cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the project or
build display name, typically users with Job/Configure or Build/Update
permission.

SECURITY-1423 / CVE-2019-10433
Dingding[钉钉] Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in job config.xml
files on the Jenkins master. This token can be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1515 / CVE-2019-10434
LDAP Email Plugin stores an LDAP bind password in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1524 / CVE-2019-10435
SourceGear Vault Plugin stores an SCM password in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# LDAP Email

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Plain text password shown in configuration form](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-10-01/#SECURITY-1515)**This plugin is up for adoption!** We are looking for new maintainers. Visit our [Adopt a Plugin](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/) initiative for more information.

## LDAP Email plugin

This plugin resolves user email addresses from an LDAP directory.

It is not needed if Jenkins uses LDAP as its authentication source and
user records have a standard "mail" attribute. In this case Jenkins will
already find user email addresses.

Configure the plugin in the `LDAP Email Lookup` section in the main
Jenkins settings page (Manage / Configure System).

Here's an example configuration file:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<com.mtvi.plateng.hudson.ldap.Configuration>
    <server>ldap://testserver:389</server>
    <baseDN>ou=People,dc=test,dc=com</baseDN>
    <bindDN>cn=Jenkins,ou=Internal,dc=test,dc=com</bindDN>
    <bindPassword>password</bindPassword>
    <emailAttribute>mail</emailAttribute>
    <searchAttribute>uid</searchAttribute>
</com.mtvi.plateng.hudson.ldap.Configuration>

```

The `bindDN` and `bindPassword` elements are only required if your LDAP
server does not support anonymous binding.

By default the plugin will form a distinguished name (DN) with this
pattern:

```
<searchAttribute>=<userName>,<baseDN>

```

However, there are environments where you need to perform an LDAP
search. To do this, check the "Perform Search" checkbox in the config
settings, which adds a performSearch element to the configuration file:

```
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<com.mtvi.plateng.hudson.ldap.Configuration>
    <server>ldap://testserver:389</server>
    <baseDN>dc=test,dc=com</baseDN>
    <bindDN>cn=Jenkins,ou=Internal,dc=test,dc=com</bindDN>
    <bindPassword>password</bindPassword>
    <emailAttribute>mail</emailAttribute>
    <searchAttribute>uid</searchAttribute>
        <performSearch>true</performSearch>
</com.mtvi.plateng.hudson.ldap.Configuration>

```

This will perform a subtree-scoped search within the baseDN with the
filter

```
<searchAttribute>=<userName>

```
