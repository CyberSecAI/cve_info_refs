Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10343:

**CVE-2019-10343**

*   **Root Cause:** The Configuration as Code Plugin logs changes it applies to the Jenkins system log. Secrets like passwords should be masked (replaced with asterisks) in the log to prevent accidental disclosure. However, the plugin failed to reliably identify and mask sensitive values. Specifically, it did not handle cases where plugins used the `Secret` type to store credentials encrypted on disk but didn't expose the `Secret` type in their Java API.
*   **Weakness:**  Insufficient secret masking in log messages. The Configuration as Code Plugin's mechanism for detecting secrets was not robust enough and missed some instances of sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Accidental disclosure of secrets (passwords, credentials) in the Jenkins system log. This could potentially allow unauthorized access to systems or resources protected by those secrets.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins system logs can view the unmasked secrets.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need to have at least Overall/Read access to the Jenkins system log.

**Technical Details:**
* Between Configuration as Code Plugin 0.8-alpha and 1.0, log messages contained values if the values were specified using properties in the YAML file.
* Since Configuration as Code Plugin 1.1, log messages in Configuration as Code Plugin instead mask values of type `Secret`, which is used in Jenkins to store the values encrypted on disk.
* This did not work in many instances, as plugins could use the Secret type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the Secret type appear in their Java API.

**Mitigation:** The vulnerability is addressed by improving the secret detection mechanism in the Configuration as Code plugin. The plugin now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.

Additionally, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.Attribute` to a level that does not include `INFO` messages as a workaround.
