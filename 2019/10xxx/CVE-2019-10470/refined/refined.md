Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10470:

**CVE-2019-10470: Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in kubernetes-ci Plugin**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin (kubernetes-ci) provides a list of applicable credential IDs for users configuring the plugin. This functionality lacks proper permission checks.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin doesn't verify if the user has the necessary permissions to access the credential IDs.
*  **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can obtain a list of valid credential IDs. These IDs can then be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (like CVE-2019-10468 and CVE-2019-10469) to capture the actual credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with Overall/Read permission in Jenkins by interacting with the credential ID listing functionality in the `kubernetes-ci` plugin.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker must have Overall/Read permission within the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in the `kubernetes-ci` plugin allows users with read access to enumerate valid credential IDs. While this vulnerability on its own doesn't directly reveal credentials, the revealed IDs are used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities in the plugin to capture credentials stored in Jenkins.
