Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10351:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Caliper CI plugin for Jenkins stores credentials in plaintext within the job's `config.xml` files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials (likely usernames and passwords or API keys) without any encryption or obfuscation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with sufficient access can obtain these credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to systems or resources protected by these credentials.
- **Lateral Movement:** If the disclosed credentials provide access to other systems within the infrastructure, attackers might use them to pivot and further compromise the environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker who has direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files and retrieve the credentials.
- **Extended Read Permission:**  Users with "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins can also view the `config.xml` files and potentially extract the stored credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local System Access:** Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system is a method for exploitation.
- **Jenkins User with Extended Read Access:** A Jenkins user possessing the "Extended Read" permission can also exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states that there was no fix available at the time of publication.
- The vulnerability was identified by David Fiser from Trend Micro Team Nebula.
