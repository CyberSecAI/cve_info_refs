    "root_cause": "A NULL pointer dereference in the `ovl_posix_acl_create` function within the overlayfs filesystem code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The `ovl_create` function can return a positive number, leading to a null pointer dereference of `path` in `may_open`."

    "impact": "A local attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the kernel.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access is required to exploit this vulnerability.",
