Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10898:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The GSUP dissector in Wireshark could enter an infinite loop. This occurs due to a lack of proper validation of the Information Element length within the GSUP protocol.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Infinite loop in the GSUP dissector.
- Insufficient input validation

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Excessive CPU consumption, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition
- Application crash

**Attack vectors:**
- Injecting a malformed GSUP packet onto the network (on the wire)
- Convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file containing a malicious GSUP packet

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to inject packets onto a network being monitored by Wireshark, or to create a crafted packet capture file.
- No authentication or special privileges are required

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability was discovered by the OSS-Fuzz project.
- The vulnerability is present in Wireshark version 3.0.0 and is fixed in version 3.0.1.
- The fix implemented in `epan/dissectors/packet-gsm_gsup.c` involves rejecting an invalid Information Element length.
