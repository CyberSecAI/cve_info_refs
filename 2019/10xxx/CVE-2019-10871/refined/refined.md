Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10871:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read in the `PSOutputDev::checkPageSlice` function within the Poppler library. This occurs when processing specific PDF files, due to an incorrect calculation of the image buffer size.  The code attempts to read 4 bytes per pixel when an RGB image is provided instead of a CMYK image.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-based buffer over-read:**  The `checkPageSlice` function reads beyond the allocated memory buffer when handling certain images, leading to out-of-bounds access.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Reading out-of-bounds can lead to memory corruption and unpredictable behavior. 
*   **Application Crash:**  The vulnerability can cause the application to crash, as evident by the AddressSanitizer output which shows a crash due to memory access violation.
*   **Potential Information Leak:** Depending on the memory layout, an attacker might be able to read sensitive data from adjacent memory regions though this is not explicitly mentioned.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious PDF file:** An attacker can craft a malicious PDF file that triggers the vulnerability when processed by the Poppler library.
*  **Image Processing**: An attacker can craft a malformed image within a PDF that, when processed, triggers an over-read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide a malformed or specially crafted PDF file to an application using the vulnerable poppler library.

**Additional information:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered in Poppler version 0.74.0, and a patch was provided by the upstream project.
*   Red Hat acknowledged the vulnerability and classified it as having a Moderate security impact, addressed in security advisories for various Red Hat products.
*   The Debian Security Team also acknowledged the issue, initially fixed it, then reverted the fix due to a regression, before releasing another version with a complete fix.
*   The vulnerability is present in the handling of RGB data, where it's being treated as CMYK data.
*  The vulnerable code is in `PSOutputDev.cc` and related to the `checkPageSlice` function.
*  The vulnerability can be reproduced with a specific crafted PDF and `pdftops -level1sep`.
