**CVE-2019-10455**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Rundeck Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Missing permission check.
    *   CSRF vulnerability (due to the form validation method not requiring POST requests)

    *   Attacker needs to induce a user to initiate a connection test to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   Attacker needs to have access to a Jenkins instance.
    *   Attacker needs Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
