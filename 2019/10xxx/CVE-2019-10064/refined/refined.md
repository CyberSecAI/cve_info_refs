{
  "CVE-2019-10064": {
    "Root cause": "The Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) mode in hostapd uses predictable PRNGs due to the lack of proper seeding of the random number generator.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-331: Insufficient Entropy"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to defeat flood prevention techniques in EAP mode, potentially leading to a denial of service. Remote network access may also be possible in some configurations.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the EAP mode of hostapd, specifically in the anti-clogging token generation.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the EAP authentication process. Remote access is required, and no local access is needed."
