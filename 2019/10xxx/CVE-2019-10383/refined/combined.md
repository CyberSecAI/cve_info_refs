Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following
releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Jenkins weekly 2.192
* Jenkins LTS 2.176.3
* IBM Application Security on Cloud 1.2.5
* Splunk Plugin 1.8.0

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-08-28/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1453 / CVE-2019-10383
Jenkins did not properly escape the update site URL in some status
messages shown in the update center, resulting in a stored cross-site
scripting vulnerability that is exploitable by administrators and affects
other administrators.

SECURITY-1491 / CVE-2019-10384
Jenkins allowed the creation of CSRF tokens without a corresponding web
session ID. This is the result of an incomplete fix for SECURITY-626 in
the 2019-07-17 security advisory. This allowed attackers able to obtain a
CSRF token without associated session ID to implement CSRF attacks with
the following constraints:

* The token had to be created for the anonymous user (and could only be
  used for actions the anonymous user can perform)
* The victim’s IP address needed to remain unchanged (unless the proxy
  compatibility option was enabled)
* The victim must not have a valid web session at the time of the attack

SECURITY-1294 / CVE-2019-10390
Splunk Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-
submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to
sandbox protection. This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to
execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master by applying AST transforming
annotations such as @Grab to source code elements.

SECURITY-1512 / CVE-2019-10391
IBM Application Security on Cloud Plugin stores service passwords in job
configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in
exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-08-28

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* Jenkins (core)
* [Deprecated: IBM AppScan
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ibm-application-security)
* [Splunk
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/splunk-devops)

## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in update center

**SECURITY-1453
/
CVE-2019-10383**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not properly escape the update site URL in some status messages shown in the update center, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability that is exploitable by administrators and affects other administrators.

Jenkins now escapes the update site URL in status messages shown in the update center.

### CSRF protection tokens for anonymous users did not expire in some circumstances

**SECURITY-1491
/
CVE-2019-10384**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)

**Description:**

Jenkins allowed the creation of CSRF tokens without a corresponding web session ID.
This is the result of an incomplete fix for SECURITY-626 in [the 2019-07-17 security advisory](/security/advisory/2019-07-17/#SECURITY-626).
This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token without associated session ID to implement CSRF attacks with the following constraints:

* The token had to be created for the anonymous user (and could only be used for actions the anonymous user can perform).
* The victim’s IP address needed to remain unchanged (unless the proxy compatibility option was enabled).
* The victim must not have a valid web session at the time of the attack.

CSRF token generation now creates a web session if none exists yet, so that the lack of a web session ID cannot be exploited.

|  | This fix may impact scripts that obtain a crumb from the crumb issuer API. They may need to be updated to retain the session ID for subsequent requests. For further information, see the [LTS upgrade guide](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.176/#SECURITY-626). |
| --- | --- |

As a workaround, administrators can remove any permissions granted to the anonymous user so that no privileged actions can be taken.
Alternatively, the [Strict Crumb Issuer](https://plugins.jenkins.io/strict-crumb-issuer) Plugin can be used instead of the built-in default crumb issuer to prevent this issue, because the vulnerability is not present in the plugin.

### Sandbox Bypass in Splunk Plugin

**SECURITY-1294
/
CVE-2019-10390**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`splunk-devops`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/splunk-devops)**

**Description:**

Splunk Plugin has a form validation HTTP endpoint used to validate a user-submitted Groovy script through compilation, which was not subject to sandbox protection.
This allowed attackers with Overall/Read access to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller by applying AST transforming annotations such as `@Grab` to source code elements.

The affected HTTP endpoint now applies a safe Groovy compiler configuration preventing the use of unsafe AST transforming annotations.

### Deprecated: IBM AppScan Plugin showed plain text password in job configuration form fields

**SECURITY-1512
/
CVE-2019-10391**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ibm-application-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ibm-application-security)**

**Description:**

Deprecated: IBM AppScan Plugin stores service passwords in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Deprecated: IBM AppScan Plugin no longer transmits the password form field in plain text.

## Severity

* SECURITY-1294:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
* SECURITY-1453:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1491:
  [High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)
* SECURITY-1512:
  [low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Versions

  up to and including
  2.176.2
* **Deprecated: IBM AppScan
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  1.2.4
* **Splunk
  Plugin**
  up to and including

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

# Splunk

How to install

* [Documentation](/splunk-devops/)
* [Releases](/splunk-devops/releases/)
* [Issues](/splunk-devops/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/splunk-devops/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/splunk-devops/healthscore/)

Splunk plugin for Jenkins provides deep insights into your Jenkins
master and node infrastructure, job and build details such as console
logs, status, artifacts, and an incredibly efficient way to analyze test
results.

The plugin is used together with a [Splunk App for
Jenkins](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3332) that
provides out-of-the-box dashboards and search capabilities to enable
organizations to run a high performing Jenkins cluster and bring
operational intelligence into the software development life cycle.

## Splunk Plugin for Jenkins

### 1. Configure Splunk Server

* Go to https://<jenkins-url>/configure
* Enter Hostname, Port, and Token

  + For Splunk cloud user, the host name is something like
    http-inputs-xx.splunkcloud.com or
    http-inputs-xx.cloud.splunk.com, port is 443
  + For Splunk enterprise user, the host name is the indexer host
    name, and port is 8088 by default
* Check "Raw Events Supported" if you are using Splunk version
  6.3.1511 or later
* SSL is enabled by default in Splunk, it will protect the data
  transferred on network.
* Click "Test Connection" to verify the setup
* Check "Enable" and Save

  ![basic config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/splunk-devops-plugin/master/doc/images/splunk_for_jenkins_config_basic.png)

### 2. Configure Metadata

Specify index, host, sourcetype for the various events. Metadata can be
configured to collect as little or as much Jenkins information as you
need and sent to Splunk for analysis.

* index is a data repository in Splunk, you can set a different data
  retention policy and access privileges for each index in Splunk. You
  need create the index in Splunk manually, the plugin will not create
  any index.
* sourcetype is used by Splunk to determine how incoming data is
  formatted, see also [Why sourcetype
  matters](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.4.3/Data/Whysourcetypesmatter)
* host is used to identify which Jenkins master is the source of the
  data

There are 7 types of events which can be customized

| Event type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| *Build Report* | Junit or other Reports sent by calling "send(message)" DSL script |
| *Build Event* | Sent when job are started and completed |
| *Queue Information* | Basic queue information and Jenkins health metrics, sent when queue get updated and every 45 seconds by default. You can add "-Dcom.splunk.splunkjenkins.queueMonitorSeconds=N" to Jenkins start parameters to adjust the timing |
| *Console Log* | Build console log, e.g. job/abc/123/console, node log and Jenkins master log (jenkins.log) |
| *Log File* | Artifact contents, send by calling "archive(includes)" DSL script |
| *Slave Information* | The slave(agent) health metrics, sent every 8 minutes by default. You can add "-Dcom.splunk.splunkjenkins.slaveMonitorMinutes=N" to Jenkins start parameters to adjust the timing |
| *Jenkins Config* | The contents of Jenkins configuration items, e.g. config.xml, sent when the config file get updated. |

you can customize the index, sourcetype in the "Custom Metadata" section.

![metadata](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/splunk-devops-plugin/master/doc/images/splunkins_metadata.png)

#### 2.1. Metadata configuration for [Splunk App for Jenkins](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3332)

* For Splunk version 6.5 or later, it is recommended to use the
  plugin's default config
* For Splunk 6.3.x or 6.4.x, please adjust the default sourcetype to
  `json:jenkins:old` (please remove it if Splunk get upgraded to latest
  version, otherwise data will be extracted twice)

![json:jenkins:old](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/splunk-devops-plugin/master/doc/images/json_jenkins_sourcetype_old.png)

### 3. Customize The Job Data Sent to Splunk

In the **Advanced** configuration section, you can customize the post
data using groovy DSL.

While the default settings should suffice for most Jenkins users, the
Advanced configuration section allows you to use groovy DSL to customize
the data sent to Splunk.

The groovy script can use the variable ***splunkins***, which provides
access to the following objects and methods:

* `send(Object message)` will send the information to splunk
* `getBuildEvent()` will return metadata about the build, such as
  build result, build URL, user who triggered the build
* `getJunitReport(int pageSize)` will return a list of test results,
  which contains total, passes, failures, skips, time and testcase of
  type List<hudson.tasks.junit.CaseResult>
* `getJunitReport(int pageSize, List<String> ignoredTestResultActions)` will
  return a list of test results except test formats specified in
  ignoredTestResultActions
* `sendCoverageReport(pageSize)` send coverage, each event contains
  max pageSize metrics
* `getJunitReport()` is an alias of
  `getJunitReport(Integer.MAX_VALUE)`
* `archive(String includes, String excludes, boolean uploadFromSlave, String fileSizeLimit)`
  send log file to splunk
* `archive(String includes)` is an alias of
  `archive(includes, null, false, "")`
* `getAction(Class type)` is an alias of `build.getAction(type)`
* `getActionByClassName(String className)` same as
  `getAction(Class type)` but no need to import the class before use
* `hasPublisherName(String className)` check whether the publisher is
  configured for the build (applied to AbstractBuild only)
* Here is the default settings for post job data processing (since
  v.1.5.0)

```
//send job metadata and junit reports with page size set to 50 (each event contains max 50 test cases)
splunkins.sendTestReport(50)
//send coverage, each event contains max 50 class metrics
splunkins.sendCoverageReport(50)
//send all logs from workspace to splunk, with each file size limits to 10MB
splunkins.archive("**/*.log", null, false, "10MB")

```
#### 4. Customize log files at job level (optional)

Jenkins builds can produce many artifacts which can contain useful build
information. The plugin can be configured globally (step #3) to collect
all artifacts using the archive command. You can also specify what
artifacts to send to Splunk at the job level by adding Splunk's
post-build action 'Send data to Splunk'

* Add a "post-build action" called "Send data to Splunk"
* Enter an ant-style pattern matching string for your junit xml
  collection

![post-job-config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkinsci/splunk-devops-plugin/master/doc/images/splunk_for_jenkins_post_job.png)

#### 5. Features Controlled with System Properties (optional)

System properties are defined by passing -Dproperty=value to the java
command line to start Jenkins. Make sure to pass all of these arguments
before the -jar argument, otherwise they will be ignored.
Example: `java -Dsplunkins.buffer=4096 -jar jenkins.war`

| Property | Default Value | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| com.splunk.splunkjenkins.JdkSplunkLogHandler.level | INFO | log message levels lower than this will not be send to splunk |
| splunkins.buffer | 4096 | console log buffer size |
| splunkins.allowConsoleLogPattern | (empty) | regular expression for 'interesting' build. if it is set, only send to splunk for the job whose build url matches the pattern |
| splunkins.debugLogBatchSize | 128 | batch size for sending verbose level (FINE,FINER,FINEST) log record |
| splunkins.enableRemoteTaskListenerDecorator | true | whether to capture remote TaskListener |
| splunkins.ignoreConfigChangePattern | (?:queue|nodeMonitors|UpdateCenter|global-build-stats).xml|/(?:fingerprint|builds|config-history)/.\*?xml | regular expression for ignoring config file changes |
| splunkins.verifySSL | false | enable ssl certificate verification for splunk endpoint |
| splunkins.junitStdioLimit | 2097152 | trim long junit standard output/error, set it to 0 for unlimited |
| splunkins.decodePipelineConsole | true | decode pipeline job console note to get parallel label, link href |
| splunkins.auditPostRequest | true | audit trail for script invoking, credentials updating |

## Splunk Dashboards for Jenkins

You can download and install the Splunk App for Jenkins from
<https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3332>

Once installed, the Splunk App will use the data being sent by the
Splunk plugin for Jenkins and show various dashboards and search
capabilities. Here are some of the key features

**Overview** - Visualize multiple masters and associated slaves in a
single page. View build status trends and be able to drill down and get
details information about any build.

**Build Analysis** - Easily find any Jenkins build using a variety of
easy to use filters. View build summary or drill down to see build
status trends, build time and queue time analysis, tests pass/fail
trends, test runtime distribution, and console logs couple with Splunk's
powerful search interface.

**Test Analysis** - If you are a test engineer and spend countless hours
looking at test results in Jenkins, you will love this feature. Test
Results shows all the failing tests with stack traces, flags regression
failures, groups test failures by errors, captures Jenkin's environment
variables, and provides nifty filters to find tests with long run times,
particular errors, testsuites, etc.

**Jenkins Health** - Splunk Jenkins Apps captures Jenkins internal JVM
information as well as keys metrics like queue size, executors and
nodes stats, Jenkins master logs, and Jenkins node stats. All this
information is captured in real-time, allowing you to quickly discover
hard to find issues and fix them before they become a bottleneck for
development teams. No more ssh-ing into Jenkins systems to find issues.

**Jenkins Nodes** - Analyze all activity on a particular node. View
builds executed on a node, view real-time node logs, build activity
across all nodes, and check connection history to find out unstable
Jenkins nodes. This feature is extremely helpful in identifying
problematic components in a Jenkins cluster and optimizing your team's
throughput.

**Audit Trail** - Audit trail feature allows you to see who has logged
into your Jenkins system and done any activity like
starting/aborting/changing jobs. You can also see what configs have been
changed by some user and can view the config xml directly in Splunk.
This feature is particularly useful for organization with security and
compliance use cases.

## FAQ

### How can I send historical data prior to the time plugin get installed

Access <jenkins\_url>/script, and execute the groovy code (update the
time range if needed).

```
def dataParser=new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MMM-dd HH:mm")
def startTime=0
def endTime=dataParser.parse("2016-OCT-26 13:24").getTime()
def archiver=new com.splunk.splunkjenkins.utils.BuildInfoArchiver()
archiver.run(startTime, endTime)

```
### I got "Server is busy, maybe caused by blocked queue", what can I do

Please try below options

a) Adjust splunk queue size to a larger value, such as 5MB.
Edit SPLUNK\_HOME/etc/system/local/server.conf and add

```
[queue]
maxSize = 5MB

```

b) Adjust console text/log file buffer size, such as 10KB, Add below
line to Jenkins startup script

```
-Dsplunkins.buffer=10240

```
### I am using upstream/downstream jobs, how can I consolidate the test results to root trigger job?

You can use "Customize Event Processing Script"

```
/**
 * Transform job metadata before sending to splunk
 * This script is configured in Jenkins->Configure System->Splunk for Jenkins Configuration->Advanced
 *  ->Customize Event Processing Command
 */

import groovy.json.JsonSlurperClassic

            return [upstreamCause.upstreamUrl, upstreamCause.upstreamBuild, upstreamCause.upstreamProject]
        }
    }
    return [build.parent.url, build.number, build.parent.fullName]
}

    def junitResults = splunkins.getJunitReport(50, ["hudson.tasks.test.AggregatedTestResultAction"])
    if (!junitResults) {
        return
    }

    ]

            Map pagedEvent = event + ["testsuite": junitResult, "page_num": idx + 1]
            splunkins.send(pagedEvent)

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |
