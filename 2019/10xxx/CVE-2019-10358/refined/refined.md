Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10358:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Maven Integration Plugin failed to apply build log decorators defined in the Build Environment configuration to module builds.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue is the lack of proper application of log decorators to module builds. This means that any masking or transformation of sensitive information configured in the Jenkins environment is not applied to the logs generated by individual Maven modules within a build.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Sensitive information present in the module build logs could be exposed. This is because build log decorators, which are meant to mask sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys), are not being applied to the module logs. This could lead to accidental disclosure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data by accessing the module build logs. This could be done through the Jenkins UI if the attacker has access to the logs, or potentially via other means if the logs are exposed elsewhere.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to have at least minimal access to Jenkins to view build logs. An attacker with the ability to view job build logs can potentially view the unmasked sensitive content from module builds. The specific level of access would depend on the security configuration of the Jenkins instance.

In summary, the vulnerability is due to a missing feature in the Maven Integration plugin which results in sensitive information within module build logs not being masked as intended, potentially exposing the information to users with the ability to view logs.
