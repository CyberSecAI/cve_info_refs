## Jenkins plugin for building Maven 2/3 jobs

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/maven-plugin@master/docs/images/hn.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/hn.png)

**Maven jobs and Java versions compatibility** : Because java serialized classes are exchanged between Jenkins Controller and Maven Jobs it is required that the JVM used to launch Maven is superior or equal to the version of Java for which Jenkins Controller is built for.

* Jenkins >= 1.520 requires Java 6 thus Maven jobs must be launched with Java >= 6.
* Jenkins >= 1.612 requires Java 7 thus Maven jobs must be launched with Java >= 7.
* Jenkins >= 2.54 requires Java 8 thus Maven jobs must be launched with Java >= 8.
* Jenkins >= 2.357 requires Java 11 thus Maven jobs must be launched with Java >= 11.

See also [JENKINS-18403](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-18403), [JENKINS-28294](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-28294)

**If Jenkins detects that you are trying to use a JDK older than the controller prerequisite, it automatically reconfigures your build to use the JDK on which your agent is running.** It displays in your build logs a message like :

```
ERROR: ================================================================================
ERROR: Invalid project setup: hudson/maven/AbstractMavenProcessFactory$ConfigureOriginalJDK : Unsupported major.minor version 51.0
ERROR: [JENKINS-18403][JENKINS-28294] JDK 'j6' not supported to run Maven projects.
ERROR: Maven projects have to be launched with a Java version greater or equal to the minimum version required by the controller.
ERROR: Use the Maven JDK Toolchains (plugin) to build your maven project with an older JDK.
ERROR: Retrying with agent Java and setting compile/test properties to point to /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.6.0.jdk/Contents/Home/.
ERROR: ================================================================================

```

**But due to the remoting upgrade in Jenkins 2.27+ this workaround doesn't work anymore if your agent or Maven job is using Java < 7 - [JENKINS-40990](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-40990) (Because remoting is compiled for Java 7)**

Known issues are listed [in Jira](https://issues.jenkins.io/issues/?jql=resolution%20is%20EMPTY%20and%20component%3D16033)

Historically this plugin was released alongside Jenkins core releases. 2.0 releases up to 2.204.1 saw this plugin released separately, but still bundled with Jenkins, although not always in the newest version. See [Stop bundling Maven plugin and Subversion plugin with Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/upgrade-guide/2.204/#stop-bundling-maven-plugin-and-subversion-plugin-with-jenkins).

## Version history

See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-plugin/releases) for recent releases and [the legacy changelog](https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-plugin/blob/maven-plugin-3.19/CHANGELOG.md) for older releases.

## Risks

The Jenkins project recommends that users transition from the Maven job type to use Pipeline jobs or freestyle jobs. Stephen Connolly describes many of the reasons in his 2013 blog post, ["Jenkins' Maven job type considered evil"](http://javaadventure.blogspot.com/2013/11/jenkins-maven-job-type-considered-evil.html). A revised version of that blog post is included here.

There are multiple ways to build a Maven project with Jenkins:

* Use a free-style project with a Maven build step
* Use a Maven-style project
* Use a Pipeline project with a shell, batch, or powershell build step that calls Maven

The first way runs the build as Maven intended. The second way adds a whole lot of hooks and can even modify the build in ways that Maven did not intend.

The first way requires that you configure stuff yourself. The second way tries to "guess" what you want and auto-configure it.

The first way is initially less user friendly, i.e. you have more UI to click through to get the full set of reports. The second way is initially more user friendly... but when things go wrong... well sorry out of luck.

If something goes wrong with the first way, worst case you add a shell build step above the Maven build step that just runs SET, trigger a build, login to the build agent, switch to the user the build is running as, apply the environment your SET build step output and then run the Maven command that the build's console log captured. That will give you an exact reproduction of the Maven build and you can debug why your build is not working. When something goes wrong with the second way, well good luck. By all means try to do the same as you would for a freestyle project, but at the end of the day, there is no way you can replicate the injected hooks that Jenkins puts into your Maven build. You can get an approximate reproduction, and hey, that may just be enough to let you figure out what is wrong and fix your build... but there are cases where you cannot.

It is very attractive because is easy to configure (so users use it) and gives nice per-module reports. When it blows up, and it will blow up, it blows up big.

## Features of Maven job type

The Jenkins project recommends Pipeline jobs and freestyle jobs for Maven projects. See the earlier section to understand the risks associated with using the Maven job type instead of Pipeline or freestyle jobs.

This plugin provides a more advanced integration with additional features like:

* Automatic configuration of reporting plugins (Junit, Findbugs, ...)
* Automatic triggering across jobs based on SNAPSHOTs published/consumed
* Incremental build - only build changed modules
* Build modules in parallel on multiple executors/nodes
* Post build deployment of binaries only if the project succeeded and all tests passed
* ...

## Environment variables

This plugin exposes variables found from the project's POM (as of version 2.1):

* **POM\_DISPLAYNAME** - taken from `<name>` in POM
* **POM\_VERSION** - taken from `<version>` in POM
* **POM\_GROUPID** - taken from `<groupId>` in POM
* **POM\_ARTIFACTID** - taken from `<artifactId>` in POM
* **POM\_PACKAGING** - taken from `<packaging>` in POM

## Building a project

Jenkins provides a job type dedicated to Maven 2/3. This job type integrates Jenkins deeply with Maven 2/3 and provides the following benefits compared to the more generic Pipeline and free-style software projects.

Jenkins parses Maven POMs to obtain much of the information needed to do its work. As a result, the amount of configuration is drastically reduced. Jenkins listens to Maven execution and figures out what should be done when on its own. For example, it will automatically record the JUnit report when Maven runs the test phase. Or if you run the javadoc goal, Jenkins will automatically record javadoc. Jenkins automatically creates project dependencies between projects which declare SNAPSHOT dependencies between each other. Thus mostly you just need to configure SCM information and what goals you'd like to run, and Jenkins will figure out everything else.

## Automatic build chaining from module dependencies

Jenkins reads dependencies of your project from your POM and if they are also built on Jenkins, triggers are configured so that a new build in one of those dependencies will automatically start a new build of your project. Jenkins understands many types of dependencies in the POM, including:

* parent POM
* `<dependencies>` section of your project
* `<plugins>` section of your project
* `<extensions>` section of your project
* `<reporting>` section of your project

This process takes versions into account, so you can have multiple versions/branches of your project on the same Jenkins and it will correctly determine dependencies. Note that dependency version ranges are not supported, see [JENKINS-2787](https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-2787) for the reason.

This feature can be disabled on demand - see configuration option `Build whenever a SNAPSHOT dependency is built`.

## Maven surefire test results

The Maven Integration plugin understands the POM and knows about specific Maven testing plugins, such as the [Maven Surefire Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/) and the [Tycho Surefire Plugin](https://www.eclipse.org/tycho/sitedocs/tycho-surefire-plugin/plugin-info.html). The definitive list of supported test plugins can be found in the [TestMojo source code](https://github.com/jenkinsci/maven-plugin/blob/master/src/main/java/hudson/maven/reporters/TestMojo.java).

For such known test plugins the Maven Integration plugin is able to collect test results from their default or POM-configured reports directory. Test results from Maven test-capable plugins unknown to the Maven Integration plugin can be collected if their execution goal is 'test', 'test-run', 'integration-test' and they have a 'reportsDirectory' configuration property containing the location of their test results. Other than that results from unknown test plugins (such as org.codehaus.mojo:exec-maven-plugin) will not be collected, even if they are returned in the configured test results location (default `target/surefire-reports`).

### Collecting test results from arbitrary test plugins

As of org.jenkins-ci.main:maven-plugin:2.13, there is a mechanism to inform the Maven Integration plugin of the location of test results produced by an unknown Maven test plug-in. If the POM declares a property with a name matching the pattern 'jenkins..reportsDirectory', where is the unknown test plug-in's execution identifier, the Maven Integration plugin will resolve the value of this property against the project base directory and collect any test results that it finds in the resulting directory.

### Example

In order to have Jenkins retrieve the test results produced by an unknown plugin with a plugin execution ID 'e2eTests' which generates JUnit-compatible XML reports in the directory `target/protractor-reports` in the project workspace, add the following property to your project POM:

```
<properties>
    <jenkins.e2eTests.reportsDirectory>target/protractor-reports</jenkins.e2eTests.reportsDirectory>
</properties>
```

SECURITY-1465 (1) / CVE-2019-10355
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented by
casting crafted objects to other types. This allowed attackers able to
specify sandboxed scripts to invoke constructors that weren’t whitelisted.

Additionally, this could be used to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins
master.

SECURITY-1465 (2) / CVE-2019-10356
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
crafted subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions. This
allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1422 / CVE-2019-10357
Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin provides form validation to
determine whether the revision (e.g. commit, tag, or branch name) specified
for a global library exists in the repository. This form validation method
lacked a permission check, allowing attackers with Overall/Read access to
determine whether an attacker-specified revision exists in an SCM repository
configured for use in an existing shared library.

SECURITY-713 / CVE-2019-10358
Maven Integration Plugin did not apply build log decorators from the Build
Environment configuration to module builds. This could prevent sensitive
content in module build logs from being masked.

SECURITY-1098 / CVE-2019-10359
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to initiate the release process use POST. This resulted in a
cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to perform
releases.

SECURITY-1184 / CVE-2019-10360
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not properly escape variables in multiple
views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-1435 / CVE-2019-10361
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global
configuration file org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.m2release.M2ReleaseBuildWrapper.
xml on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1279 / CVE-2019-10343
Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins
system log. Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with
asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.

Between Configuration as Code Plugin 0.8-alpha and 1.0, log messages
contained values if the values were specified using properties in the YAML
file (SECURITY-929).
Since Configuration as Code Plugin 1.1, log messages in Configuration as
Code Plugin instead mask values of type Secret, which is used in Jenkins to
store the values encrypted on disk. This did not work in many instances, as
plugins could use the Secret type to store credentials encrypted on disk
while not having the Secret type appear in their Java API.

SECURITY-1290 / CVE-2019-10344
Configuration as Code Plugin provides a generated schema and reference
documentation for the configuration options supported on the current Jenkins
instance. These URLs did not perform additional permission checks, resulting
in their content being available to users with Overall/Read access. This
included detailed information about installed plugins that may not be
available otherwise.

SECURITY-1303 / CVE-2019-10345
Configuration as Code Plugin provides a custom configurator for the Jenkins
proxy configuration.

This feature did not mask the password for logging or encrypt it in the
export.

SECURITY-1446 / CVE-2019-10362
Configuration as Code Plugin allows exporting the live Jenkins
configuration, as well as importing and applying a configuration provided in
the same format. One of the features of the import is that it allows
specifying variable references (e.g. ${VARIABLE_NAME}) in the configuration
YAML file. These will be replaced by the value of the corresponding
environment variable (or other source of secrets) during import (
interpolation). If such a value should not be interpolated, the escape
character ^ can be used before (e.g. ^${VARIABLE_NAME}).

Exporting did not add ^ escape characters to exported strings, such as
various entity descriptions. This allowed attackers with permission to
configure certain entities, such as credentials or agents, to specify
crafted descriptions containing variable references. These would be replaced
by the corresponding environment variable’s value during a subsequent import.

SECURITY-1458 / CVE-2019-10363
Configuration as Code Plugin allows to export the current Jenkins
configuration as a YAML file. Secrets such as passwords should be exported
in their encrypted form to prevent accidental disclosure.

Configuration as Code Plugin did not reliably detect which values in the
exported YAML file need to be considered sensitive (e.g. credentials and
other secrets), as plugins could use the Secret type to store credentials
encrypted on disk while not having the Secret type appear in their Java API.
This resulted in credentials being exported in plain text in some cases.

SECURITY-673 / CVE-2019-10364
Amazon EC2 Plugin printed a log message that contained the beginning of the
private key to the Jenkins system log.

SECURITY-1345 / CVE-2019-10365
Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin created a temporary file named .kube…config
containing a temporary access token in the project workspace. This allowed
the file to be accessed via workspace browsers, or accidentally archived,
disclosing the token.

SECURITY-1429 / CVE-2019-10366
Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml
files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass through type casts in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1465 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10355**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented by casting crafted objects to other types.
This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to invoke constructors that weren’t approved.

Additionally, this could be used to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

Casting collections to other types as an alternative syntax for constructor invocation is now only allowed when the collection type is defined in `java.util`, and prohibited otherwise.
Casting files and enums to arrays is now intercepted by the sandbox and treated as the invocation of an equivalent method.

### Sandbox bypass through method pointer expressions in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1465 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10356**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through crafted subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions.
This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

Method pointer subexpressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Missing permission check in Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin

**SECURITY-1422
/
CVE-2019-10357**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-cps-global-lib`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps-global-lib)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin provides form validation to determine whether the revision (e.g. commit, tag, or branch name) specified for a global library exists in the repository.
This form validation method lacked a permission check, allowing attackers with Overall/Read access to determine whether an attacker-specified revision exists in an SCM repository configured for use in an existing shared library.

Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin now performs the appropriate permission check.

### Maven Integration Plugin did not mask sensitive values in module build logs

**SECURITY-713
/
CVE-2019-10358**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`maven-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin)**

**Description:**

Maven Integration Plugin did not apply build log decorators from the Build Environment configuration to module builds.
This could prevent sensitive content in module build logs from being masked.

Maven Integration Plugin now applies build log decorators from the Build Environment configuration to module builds.

### CSRF vulnerability in Maven Release Plug-in Plugin

**SECURITY-1098
/
CVE-2019-10359**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to initiate the release process use POST.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to perform releases.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin now requires that these requests be sent via POST.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Maven Release Plug-in Plugin

**SECURITY-1184
/
CVE-2019-10360**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not properly escape variables in multiple views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Variables on affected views are now escaped.

### Maven Release Plug-in Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1435
/
CVE-2019-10361**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.m2release.M2ReleaseBuildWrapper.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Configuration as Code Plugin failed to mask secrets in system log messages

**SECURITY-1279
/
CVE-2019-10343**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.

Between Configuration as Code Plugin 0.8-alpha and 1.0, log messages contained values if the values were specified using properties in the YAML file ([SECURITY-929](/security/advisory/2018-06-25/#SECURITY-929)).

Since Configuration as Code Plugin 1.1, log messages in Configuration as Code Plugin instead mask values of type `Secret`, which is used in Jenkins to store the values encrypted on disk.
This did not work in many instances, as plugins could use the [`Secret`](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/byShortName/Secret "Javadoc for Secret") type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the `Secret` type appear in their Java API.

Configuration as Code Plugin now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.

As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.Attribute` to a level that does not include `INFO` messages.
See [the logging documentation](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) for details.

### Configuration as Code Plugin allowed users without Overall/Administer permission to access documentation

**SECURITY-1290
/
CVE-2019-10344**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin provides a generated schema and reference documentation for the configuration options supported on the current Jenkins instance.
These URLs did not perform additional permission checks, resulting in their content being available to users with Overall/Read access.
This included detailed information about installed plugins that may not be available otherwise.

Access to these URLs is now restricted to users with Overall/Administer permission.

### Configuration as Code Plugin did not mask proxy credentials

**SECURITY-1303
/
CVE-2019-10345**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin provides a custom configurator for the Jenkins proxy configuration.

This feature did not mask the password for logging or encrypt it in the export.

Configuration as Code Plugin 1.20 and newer mask the Jenkins proxy password when logged and only store it encrypted in the export.

### Configuration as Code Plugin evaluated variable references when importing a previously exported configuration

**SECURITY-1446
/
CVE-2019-10362**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin allows exporting the live Jenkins configuration, as well as importing and applying a configuration provided in the same format.
One of the features of the import is that it allows specifying variable references (e.g. `${VARIABLE_NAME}`) in the configuration YAML file.
These will be replaced by the value of the corresponding environment variable (or [other source of secrets](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/#handling-secrets)) during import (interpolation).
If such a value should not be interpolated, the escape character `^` can be used before (e.g. `^${VARIABLE_NAME}`).

Exporting did not add `^` escape characters to exported strings, such as various entity descriptions.
This allowed attackers with permission to configure certain entities, such as credentials or agents, to specify crafted descriptions containing variable references.
These would be replaced by the corresponding environment variable’s value during a subsequent import.

The export now adds `^` escape characters to exported strings as needed to prevent them from being interpolated during import.
Previously exported configurations may require manual cleanup by Jenkins admins before being imported.

### Configuration as Code Plugin exported secret values in plain text

**SECURITY-1458
/
CVE-2019-10363**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin allows to export the current Jenkins configuration as a YAML file.
Secrets such as passwords should be exported in their encrypted form to prevent accidental disclosure.

Configuration as Code Plugin did not reliably detect which values in the exported YAML file need to be considered sensitive (e.g. credentials and other secrets), as plugins could use the [`Secret`](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/byShortName/Secret "Javadoc for Secret") type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the `Secret` type appear in their Java API.
This resulted in credentials being exported in plain text in some cases.

Configuration as Code Plugin now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of exporting encrypted secrets.

### Amazon EC2 Plugin leaked beginning of private key in system log

**SECURITY-673
/
CVE-2019-10364**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin printed a log message that contained the beginning of the private key to the Jenkins system log.

The log message no longer includes the beginning of the private key.

### Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin stored temporary secret in a user accessible location

**SECURITY-1345
/
CVE-2019-10365**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-kubernetes-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-kubernetes-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin created a temporary file named `.kubeâ¦config` containing a temporary access token in the project workspace.
This allowed the file to be accessed via workspace browsers, or accidentally archived, disclosing the token.

This temporary file is now created outside the regular project workspace.

### Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1429
/
CVE-2019-10366**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`skytap`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/skytap)**

**Description:**

Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Skytap Cloud CI Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.
