Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10762

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the `columnQuote` function of the `catfan/medoo` package. This function is intended to quote column names for SQL queries.
- The original implementation used a regular expression `'/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+(\.?[a-zA-Z0-9]+)?$/i'` that only allowed alphanumeric characters and a single dot. This was too restrictive, as valid column names may contain underscores and other characters.
- Because of this restriction, user-supplied input used as column names can bypass this filter and inject SQL code if it contains characters outside of the defined regex, leading to a SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** By providing crafted column names, an attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `columnQuote` function did not properly validate the column name input, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** An attacker can potentially access all data within the database.
- **Complete Loss of Integrity:** An attacker can modify or delete data within the database.
- **Complete Loss of Availability:** An attacker can make the database unavailable or cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-supplied input that is used as a column name within a SQL query constructed using the vulnerable package.
- This vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any prior privileges or access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to supply input to the application that will be used as a column name.
- The attacker must have network access to the system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed by updating the regular expression within the `columnQuote` function to `'/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+(\.?[a-zA-Z0-9_]+)?$/i'`, allowing underscores in column names.
- The vulnerable package versions are below 1.7.5.
- Snyk assigned a CVSS score of 9.8 (critical) to this vulnerability.
