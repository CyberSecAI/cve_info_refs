Security Advisory

CVE-2019-10636
CVE-2019-10637

Marvell was made aware of potential vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-10636 and CVE-2019-10637)
with regard to the Secure Boot feature in certain Marvell SSD controllers, which was presented
at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy taking place May 20-22, 2019.

The vulnerabilities require physical access to the SSD device incorporating the controller to
perform hardware tampering and are only relevant to SSD designs that make use of the Secure
Boot feature. Marvellâ€™s next generation of SSD controllers are not impacted and deploy
enhanced security features.

While there is low probability of exploitation on the affected devices, Marvell places the highest
priority on addressing security concerns. We have communicated to our direct customers about
the potential vulnerabilities and how to best mitigate them.

Marvell encourages customers to contact their Marvell representative for additional support.
