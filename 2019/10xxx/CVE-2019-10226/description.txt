HTML Injection has been discovered in the v0.19.0 version of the Fat Free CRM product via an authenticated request to the /comments URI. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report because some HTML formatting (such as with an H1 element) is allowed, but there is a XSS protection mechanism.
