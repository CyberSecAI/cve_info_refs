Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10391:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

* The IBM Application Security on Cloud Plugin stored service passwords in job configurations.
* While the password was encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Transmission:**  The primary weakness is the transmission of the encrypted password in plaintext within the configuration form. This exposes the password during transit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Exposure of Passwords:** Exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive service passwords.
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Access:** Exposed passwords could be used to gain unauthorized access to the connected services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Browser Extensions:** Malicious browser extensions could intercept the plaintext password during transmission.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:**  If an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the context where the configuration form is displayed, they might be able to capture the plaintext password.
*   **Other Similar Situations:** Any situation where the plaintext password in the request can be intercepted, such as through a compromised network or man-in-the-middle attacks, could result in its exposure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No specific privilege required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker without specific access to the system.
*   **Man-in-the-middle access/ability to inject code:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the communication or be able to inject code into the users' session to expose the password.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the deprecated IBM AppScan plugin.
*   The fix involves not transmitting the password form field in plaintext anymore.
*   The CVSS score is low as the vulnerability requires user interaction to capture the password and the impact is limited to the exposure of credentials.
