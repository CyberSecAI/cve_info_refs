The provided content relates to CVE-2019-10469.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The kubernetes-ci Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check.
- Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to missing POST request requirement for form validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs, leading to the capture of credentials stored in Jenkins.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack through crafted HTTP requests.
- An attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
- The attacker also needs to know valid credential IDs through other means.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- Ability to craft and send HTTP requests.
- Knowledge of valid credential IDs present in the system.
