Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10759:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `safer-eval` package, specifically in how it handles constructor properties during evaluation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A payload using constructor properties can bypass the sandbox and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Insecure use of `eval`:** The `safer-eval` package, intended to be a safer alternative to `eval`, was vulnerable to a sandbox escape.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** Attackers can access all resources within the impacted component.
*   **Complete Loss of Integrity:** Attackers can modify any files protected by the impacted component.
*   **Complete Loss of Availability:** Attackers can fully deny access to resources in the impacted component.
