Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10388:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Relution Enterprise Appstore Publisher Plugin has a missing permission check in a form validation method.
- The form validation method does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Permission Check:** Users with Overall/Read access can trigger the form validation method, which is designed to test a connection.
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method does not require POST requests making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** An attacker can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL, using attacker-specified credentials and HTTP proxy configuration. This allows the attacker to make requests to internal services or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to further attacks.
- An attacker could potentially use this to scan internal network or exfiltrate data via HTTP requests to external servers controlled by the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** Attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable form validation endpoint of the Relution Enterprise Appstore Publisher Plugin.
- **User Interaction:** Requires a user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to be logged in, and tricked into sending a forged request (CSRF).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Jenkins instance.
- **Jenkins User Account:** The attacker needs to either control an existing user account with Overall/Read access, or trick such a user into initiating the forged request.
- **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker must craft an appropriate HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-10388 details a vulnerability in the Relution Enterprise Appstore Publisher plugin, allowing an attacker to cause a Jenkins instance to make a connection to an arbitrary URL by exploiting a missing permission check and a CSRF vulnerability. This allows for Server-Side Request Forgery.
