Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10440:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The NeoLoad Plugin stored credentials in plain text within its global configuration file (`org.jenkinsci.plugins.neoload.integration.NeoGlobalConfig.xml`) and in job configuration files (`config.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** Credentials (likely usernames and passwords or API keys) were stored without encryption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller file system or users with Extended Read permissions could view the stored credentials.
- **Potential Unauthorized Access:** Exposed credentials could be used to access other systems or resources associated with the NeoLoad plugin, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system allows an attacker to read the configuration files.
- **Extended Read Permission:** Users with the "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins can view the content of job configuration files, including those storing credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Jenkins Controller's File System:**  The attacker needs access to the server hosting the Jenkins instance to directly read the configuration files.
- **Jenkins User with Extended Read Permission:** The attacker must have a Jenkins user account with the "Extended Read" permission to view job configuration files via the web interface.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory states that the NeoLoad Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David Fiser of Trend Micro.
*   The CVSS score is rated as medium, with a score of 3.3, AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
