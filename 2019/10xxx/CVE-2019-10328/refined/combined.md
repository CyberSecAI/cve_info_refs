| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1719782#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-06-12 14:35:01 UTC  ``` Token Macro Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allowed attackers able to control the contents of files processed with the ${XML} macro to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks. Token Macro Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Descriptions

### Persisted XSS vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1373
/
CVE-2019-10325**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages.
This allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Warnings Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings parser names.

### CSRF vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1391
/
CVE-2019-10326**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning counts for future builds.

Warnings Plugin now requires that these requests be sent via POST.

### XML External Entity processing vulnerability in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1409
/
CVE-2019-10327**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-maven`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-maven)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

### Unsafe entry in Script Security list of approved signatures in Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin

**SECURITY-921
/
CVE-2019-10328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-remote-loader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-remote-loader)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom list of pre-approved signatures for Script Security.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe pre-approved entry has been removed.

### InfluxDB Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1403
/
CVE-2019-10329**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`influxdb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/influxdb)**

**Description:**

InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

### Improper handling of untrusted branches in Gitea Plugin

**SECURITY-1046
/
CVE-2019-10330**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitea`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitea)**

**Description:**

Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior.
Attackers without commit access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull request content when those are trusted.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Artifactory Plugin allow capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1015 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1015 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10323**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### CSRF vulnerability in Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1347
/
CVE-2019-10324**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following
releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Gitea Plugin 1.1.2
* InfluxDB Plugin 1.22
* Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin 3.7.1
* Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin 1.5
* Warnings Next Generation Plugin 5.1.0

Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following
plugins:

* Artifactory Plugin

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-05-31/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1373 / CVE-2019-10325
Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings
parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included
HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings
parser names.

SECURITY-1391 / CVE-2019-10326
Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross-
site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning
counts for future builds.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent
via POST.

SECURITY-1409 / CVE-2019-10327
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a
way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary
directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have
Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities
for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request
forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External
Entities in XML documents.

SECURITY-921 / CVE-2019-10328
Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as
Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary
methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.

SECURITY-1403 / CVE-2019-10329
InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

SECURITY-1046 / CVE-2019-10330
Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to
the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not
be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit
access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to
Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the
configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull
request content when those are trusted.

SECURITY-1015 (1) / CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (permission check)
Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1015 (2) / CVE-2019-10323
Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1347 / CVE-2019-10324
Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to
trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1716794#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-06-04 06:30:24 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
