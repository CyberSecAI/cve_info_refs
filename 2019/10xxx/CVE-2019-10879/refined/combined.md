## Description

![@0n3m4ns4rmy](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/41856372?u=753d15cd396c68dfb08d0a6bdb347226b9602c38&v=4&size=48)[0n3m4ns4rmy](https://github.com/0n3m4ns4rmy)opened [on Mar 22, 2019](https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds/issues/2070#issue-424285006)

Hello Teeworlds dev team,

There is an integer overflow bug in CDataFileReader::Open() which can lead to a buffer overflow and possibly RCE. The integer overflow(s) occurs when calculating the Size and AllocSize.

```
unsigned Size = 0;
Size += Header.m_NumItemTypes*sizeof(CDatafileItemType);
Size += (Header.m_NumItems+Header.m_NumRawData)*sizeof(int);
if(Header.m_Version == 4)
	Size += Header.m_NumRawData*sizeof(int); // v4 has uncompressed data sizes aswell
Size += Header.m_ItemSize;

unsigned AllocSize = Size;
AllocSize += sizeof(CDatafile); // add space for info structure
AllocSize += Header.m_NumRawData*sizeof(void*); // add space for data pointers
```

As you can see there is no check to see if Size or AllocSize overflow. The integer overflow of AllocSize can lead to AllocSize being smaller than Size. AllocSize then gets used to allocate memory for the CDataFile object and Size gets used to read data to this object leading to a buffer overflow.

```
CDatafile *pTmpDataFile = (CDatafile*)mem_alloc(AllocSize, 1);
pTmpDataFile->m_Header = Header;
pTmpDataFile->m_DataStartOffset = sizeof(CDatafileHeader) + Size;
pTmpDataFile->m_ppDataPtrs = (char**)(pTmpDataFile+1);
pTmpDataFile->m_pData = (char *)(pTmpDataFile+1)+Header.m_NumRawData*sizeof(char *);
pTmpDataFile->m_File = File;
pTmpDataFile->m_Crc = Crc;

// clear the data pointers
mem_zero(pTmpDataFile->m_ppDataPtrs, Header.m_NumRawData*sizeof(void*));

// read types, offsets, sizes and item data
unsigned ReadSize = io_read(File, pTmpDataFile->m_pData, Size);
```

Regards,

Mans van Someren

openSUSE Security Update: Security update for teeworlds
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
Announcement ID: openSUSE-SU-2019:1999-1
Rating: moderate
References: #1112910 #1131729
Cross-References: CVE-2018-18541 CVE-2019-10877 CVE-2019-10878
CVE-2019-10879
Affected Products:
openSUSE Backports SLE-15-SP1
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
An update that fixes four vulnerabilities is now available.
Description:
This update for teeworlds fixes the following issues:
- CVE-2019-10879: An integer overflow in CDataFileReader::Open() could
have lead to a buffer overflow and possibly remote code execution,
because size-related multiplications were mishandled. (boo#1131729)
- CVE-2019-10878: A failed bounds check in CDataFileReader::GetData() and
CDataFileReader::ReplaceData() and related functions could have lead to
an arbitrary free and out-of-bounds pointer write, possibly resulting in
remote code execution.
- CVE-2019-10877: An integer overflow in CMap::Load() could have lead to a
buffer overflow, because multiplication of width and height were
mishandled.
- CVE-2018-18541: Connection packets could have been forged. There was no
challenge-response involved in the connection build up. A remote
attacker could have sent connection packets from a spoofed IP address
and occupy all server slots, or even use them for a reflection attack
using map download packets. (boo#1112910)
- Update to version 0.7.3.1
\* Colorful gametype and level icons in the browser instead of grayscale.
\* Add an option to use raw mouse inputs, revert to (0.6) relative mode
by default.
\* Demo list marker indicator.
\* Restore ingame Player and Tee menus, add a warning that a reconnect is
needed.
\* Emotes can now be cancelled by releasing the mouse in the middle of
the circle.
\* Improve add friend text.
\* Add a confirmation for removing a filter
\* Add a "click a player to follow" hint
\* Also hint players which key they should press to set themselves ready.
\* fixed using correct array measurements when placing egg doodads
\* fixed demo recorder downloaded maps using the sha256 hash
\* show correct game release version in the start menu and console
\* Fix platform-specific client libraries for Linux
\* advanced scoreboard with game statistics
\* joystick support (experimental!)
\* copy paste (one-way)
\* bot cosmetics (a visual difference between players and NPCs)
\* chat commands (type / in chat)
\* players can change skin without leaving the server (again)
\* live automapper and complete rules for 0.7 tilesets
\* audio toggling HUD
\* an Easter surprise...
\* new gametypes: "last man standing" (LMS) and "last team standing"
(LTS). survive by your own or as a team with limited weaponry
\* 64 players support. official gametypes are still restricted to 16
players maximum but allow more spectators
\* new skin system. build your own skins based on a variety of provided
parts
\* enhanced security. all communications require a handshake and use a
token to counter spoofing and reflection attacks
\* new maps: ctf8, dm3, lms1. Click to discover them!
\* animated background menu map: jungle, heavens (day/night themes,
customisable in the map editor)
\* new design for the menus: added start menus, reworked server browser,
settings
\* customisable gametype icons (browser). make your own!
\* chat overhaul, whispers (private messages)
\* composed binds (ctrl+, shift+, alt+)
\* scoreboard remodelled, now shows kills/deaths
\* demo markers
\* master server list cache (in case the masters are unreachable)
\* input separated from rendering (optimisation)
\* upgrade to SDL2. support for multiple monitors, non-english keyboards,
and more
\* broadcasts overhaul, optional colours support
\* ready system, for competitive settings
\* server difficulty setting (casual, competitive, normal), shown in the
browser
\* spectator mode improvements: follow flags, click on players
\* bot flags for modified servers: indicate NPCs, can be filtered out in
the server browser
\* sharper graphics all around (no more tileset\_borderfix and dilate)
\* refreshed the HUD, ninja cooldown, new mouse cursor
\* mapres update (higher resolution, fixes...)
