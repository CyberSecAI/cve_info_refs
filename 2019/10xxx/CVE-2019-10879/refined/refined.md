  "CVE-2019-10879": {
    "description": "In Teeworlds 0.7.2, there is an integer overflow in CDataFileReader::Open() in engine/shared/datafile.cpp that can lead to a buffer overflow and possibly remote code execution, because size-related multiplications are mishandled.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Integer overflow when calculating the Size and AllocSize variables in the `CDataFileReader::Open()` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Buffer overflow"
      ],
      "impact": "A buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network: potentially by sending malicious game data"
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a specially crafted datafile that causes the integer overflow"
    },
     "affected_products": [
      "teeworlds <= 0.7.2"
     ],
    "additional_information": [
       "The vulnerability occurs because the code does not check if the `Size` or `AllocSize` variables overflow before allocating memory. Specifically, the integer overflow of `AllocSize` can lead to it being smaller than `Size`.  `AllocSize` is used to allocate memory, and `Size` is used to read data into that memory, resulting in a buffer overflow if `Size` is larger than `AllocSize`",
       "The vulnerability is located in the `engine/shared/datafile.cpp` file."
