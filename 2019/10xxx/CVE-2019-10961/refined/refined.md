Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10961

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the processing of MCR files by Advantech WebAccess HMI Designer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787): The application writes data past the end of an allocated buffer due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process by exploiting the out-of-bounds write.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires user interaction: the target must open a specially crafted MCR file. The file can be delivered via a malicious web page or other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious MCR file.
- No special privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. The CVSS vector string ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)) indicates the attack vector is local, but the text indicates the vector is related to opening a malicious file, so is more remote. It also indicates user interaction is required.
