- **Root cause of vulnerability**:  XSS vulnerability in the 404 Not found page.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the 404 Not found page, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code in the context of a user's browser. This could result in session hijacking, credential theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker injects a malicious script that is executed when a user visits a non-existent page on the openITCOCKPIT application, triggering the 404 Not Found page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to craft a URL that results in a 404 error within the application in order to exploit the vulnerability, meaning they likely need to know the application's URL structure.
