Root cause of vulnerability:
- Stack-based buffer overflow in the `doHandshakefromServer` function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- The Netskope client service, running with `NT\SYSTEM` privilege, accepts network connections from localhost.
- Vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow when handling connections in the `doHandshakefromServer` function.

Impact of exploitation:
- Memory corruption
- Denial of service (crash of the service)
- Potentially cause additional impact on the system

Attack vectors:
- An authenticated user can interact with the Netskope Client service through a local network socket and trigger the vulnerability.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Local access to the system.
- Ability to authenticate to the system.
- Ability to interact with the Netskope client service through a local network socket.
