## Introduction

[![Jenkins and Git](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin@master/images/jenkins-and-git.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/master/images/jenkins-and-git.png)

The git client plugin provides git application programming interfaces (APIs) for Jenkins plugins. It can fetch, checkout, branch, list, merge, and tag repositories. Refer to the [API documentation](https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/plugin/git-client/) for specific API details.

The [GitClient interface](https://javadoc.jenkins-ci.org/plugin/git-client/org/jenkinsci/plugins/gitclient/GitClient.html) provides the primary entry points for git access. It supports username / password credentials for git repository access with HTTP and HTTPS protocols (for example, `https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin` or `https://git.example.com/your-repo.git` ). It supports private key credentials for git repository access with SSH protocol (for example, `git@github.com:jenkinsci/git-client-plugin.git` or `ssh://git@github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin.git` ). Credential support is provided by the [Jenkins credentials plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials).

## Implementations

The git client plugin default implementation requires that [command line git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed on the controller and on every agent that will use git. Command line git implementations working with large files should also install [git LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/). The command line git implementation is the canonical implementation of the git interfaces provided by the git client plugin.

Command line git is **enabled by default** when the git client plugin is installed.

### JGit

The git client plugin also includes two optional implementations ("jgit" and ["jgitapache"](#plugin-content-jgit-with-apache-http-client)) that use [Eclipse JGit](https://www.eclipse.org/jgit/), a pure Java implementation of git. The JGit implementation in the git client plugin provides most of the functionality of the command line git implementation. When the JGit implementation is incomplete, the gap is noted in console logs.

JGit is **disabled by default** when the git client plugin is installed.

### Enabling JGit

Click the "**Add Git**" button in the "**Tools**" section under "**Manage Jenkins**" to add JGit or JGit with Apache HTTP Client as a git implementation.

[![Enable JGit or JGit with Apache HTTP Client](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin@master/images/enable-jgit.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/master/images/enable-jgit.png)

### JGit timeout

The command line git implementation in the git client plugin provides a timeout setting for many operations like fetch and checkout. Operations that take more than the specified time are canceled. When the timeout is exceeded, the command line git process fails and the git client plugin API operation fails.

The JGit implementation in the git client plugin uses a different concept of timeout. The JGit timeout is a network level transport timeout rather than a timeout of a higher level JGit operation. If the JGit network transport does not receive a response within the defined timeout, the JGit API call fails. The [JGit javadoc](https://javadoc.io/doc/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit/latest/org.eclipse.jgit/org/eclipse/jgit/transport/Transport.html#setTimeout(int)) describes the JGit API.

The JGit timeout implementation prevents JGit operations from hanging indefinitely when a remote server stops responding. It does not stop a JGit operation if it has executed for more than a specified time. The JGit timeout counter is reset each time a response is received from the remote server during the JGit API call. The command line git timeout counter is set at the start of the command line git call and is not reset during the call.

### JGit with Apache HTTP Client

The original JGit implementation inside the git client plugin had issues with active directory authentication. A workaround was implemented to provide JGit but use Apache HTTP client for authentication. The issue in JGit has now been resolved and delivered in git client plugin releases. JGit with Apache HTTP Client continues to delivered to assure compatibility.

### Installing MinGit for Windows Automatically

Jenkins can install [MinGit for Windows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/wiki/MinGit) automatically. MinGit for Windows is an intentionally minimal, non-interactive distribution of Git for Windows, with third-party applications as its intended audience. Jenkins is well suited to use MinGit on Windows agents.

[![Configure MinGit for Windows to install automatically](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin@master/images/mingit-for-windows-as-a-tool.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/master/images/mingit-for-windows-as-a-tool.png)

* Configure a global git tool from "Manage Jenkins" >> "Tools" with `git` as the `Path to Git executable`
* Set the label `windows` to limit the tool installer to agents with the `windows` label
* Set the `Download URL for binary archive` as the URL of your **locally downloaded copy** of the [MinGit zip file](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/)
* Specify `mingw64\bin\git.exe` as the `Subdirectory of extracted archive`.

MinGit will be installed on each agent in `tools\git\mingw64`. The path to the git executable will be `tools\git\mingw64\bin\git.exe`.

## Windows Credentials Manager

Git for Windows is able to integrate with the Windows Credentials Manager for secure storage of credentials. Windows Credentials Manager works very well for interactive users on the Windows desktop. Windows Credentials Manager does not work as well for batch processing in the git client plugin. It is best to disable Windows Credentials Manager when installing Git on Jenkins agents running Windows.

## SSH Host Key verification

Git Client plugin provides various options to verify the SSH keys presented by Git repository host servers. By default, Git Client plugin uses the "Known hosts file" strategy to verify all host keys using the known\_hosts file.

Host key verification strategies include:

Accept first connection

Remembers the first host key encountered for each git server and requires that the same host key must be used for later access. This is usually the most convenient setting for administrators while still providing ssh host key verification

Known hosts file

Uses the existing `known_hosts` file on the controller and on the agent. This assumes the administrator has already configured this file on the controller and on all agents

Manually provided keys

Provides a form field where the administrator inserts the host keys for the git repository servers. This works well when a small set of repository servers meet the needs of most users

No verification

Disables all verification of ssh host keys. **Not recommended** because it provides no protection from "man-in-the-middle" attacks

Configure the host key verification strategy from "Manage Jenkins" >> "Security" >> "Git Host Key Verification Configuration".

[![Configure Ssh host key verification](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin@master/images/ssh-host-key-verification.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/master/images/ssh-host-key-verification.png)

| Note | OpenSSH releases prior to [OpenSSH 7.6 (released Oct 2017)](https://www.openssh.com/txt/release-7.6) do not support the ssh command line argument used to accept first connection. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, CentOS 7, Oracle Linux 7, Scientific Linux 7, Amazon Linux 2, Debian 9, and Ubuntu 16.04 all deliver OpenSSH releases older than OpenSSH 7.6. The "Git Host Key Verification Configuration" for those systems cannot use the "Accept first connection" strategy with command line git.   Those operating systems are no longer supported by the Jenkins project. More details are available in the [end of life operating systems blog post](https://www.jenkins.io/blog/2023/05/30/operating-system-end-of-life/).   Users of those operating systems have the following options:   * Upgrade to a supported operating system * Use the "Manually provided keys" host key verification strategy and provide host keys for their git hosts * Use the "Known hosts file" host key verification strategy and provide a known\_hosts file on the agents with values for the required hosts * Enable JGit and use JGit instead of command line git on agents and controllers with those older OpenSSH versions * Switch the repository URL’s in job definitions from ssh protocol to https protocol and provide a username / password credential for the clone instead of a private key credential * Use the "No verification" host key verification strategy (not recommended) |
| --- | --- |

### Configuration as Code Sample

The [configuration as code plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/) can define the SSH host key verification strategy.

The "Accept first connection" host key verification strategy can be configured like this:

```
security:
  gitHostKeyVerificationConfiguration:
    sshHostKeyVerificationStrategy: "acceptFirstConnectionStrategy"
```

The "Known hosts file" host key verification strategy can be configured like this:

```
security:
  gitHostKeyVerificationConfiguration:
    sshHostKeyVerificationStrategy: "knownHostsFileVerificationStrategy"
```

The "Manually provided keys" host key verification strategy might be configured like this:

```
security:
  gitHostKeyVerificationConfiguration:
    sshHostKeyVerificationStrategy:
      manuallyProvidedKeyVerificationStrategy:
        approvedHostKeys: |-
          bitbucket.org ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIIazEu89wgQZ4bqs3d63QSMzYVa0MuJ2e2gKTKqu+UUO
          github.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIOMqqnkVzrm0SdG6UOoqKLsabgH5C9okWi0dh2l9GKJl
          gitlab.com ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIAfuCHKVTjquxvt6CM6tdG4SLp1Btn/nOeHHE5UOzRdf
```

The "No verification" strategy (not recommended) can be configured like this:

```
security:
  gitHostKeyVerificationConfiguration:
    sshHostKeyVerificationStrategy: "noHostKeyVerificationStrategy"
```

Report issues and enhancements with the [Jenkins issue tracker](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/redirect/#17423). Please use the ["How to Report an Issue"](https://www.jenkins.io/participate/report-issue/) guidelines when reporting issues.

## Contributing to the Plugin

Refer to [contributing to the plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-client-plugin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.adoc#contributing-to-the-git-client-plugin) for contribution guidelines.

## Plugin Properties

Some plugin settings are controlled by Java system properties. The properties are often used to override a standard behavior or to revert to previous behavior. Refer to [Jenkins Features Controlled with System Properties](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/managing/system-properties/) for more details on system properties and how to set them.

checkRemoteURL

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.checkRemoteURL` is set to `false` it disables the safety checking of repository URLs.

Default is `true` so that repository URL’s are rejected if they start with `-` or contain space characters.

forceFetch

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.forceFetch` is set to `false` it allows command line git versions 2.20 and later to not update tags which have already been fetched into the workspace.

Command line git 2.20 and later have changed behavior when fetching remote tags that already exist in the repository. Command line git before 2.20 silently updates an existing tag if the remote tag points to a different SHA1 than the local tag. Command line git 2.20 and later do not update an existing tag if the remote tag points to a different SHA1 than the local tag unless the `--force` option is passed to `git fetch`.

Default is `true` so that newer command line git versions behave the same as older versions.

promptForAuthentication

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.promptForAuthentication` is set to `true` it allows command line git versions 2.3 and later to prompt the user for authentication. Command line git prompting for authentication should be rare, since Jenkins credentials should be managed through the credentials plugin.

Credential prompting could happen on multiple platforms, but is more common on Windows computers because many Windows agents run from the desktop environment. Agents running on the desktop are much less common in Unix environments.

Default is `false` so that command line git does not prompt for interactive authentication.

useCLI

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.useCLI` is set to `false`, it will use JGit as the default implementation instead of command line git.

Default is `true` so that command line git is chosen as the default implementation.

user.name.file.encoding

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.user.name.file.encoding` is set to a non-empty value (like `IBM-1047`) and the agent is running on IBM zOS, the username credentials file is written using that character set. The character sets of other credential files are not changed. The character sets on other operating systems are not changed.

Default is empty so that zOS file encoding behaves as it did previously.

user.passphrase.file.encoding

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.user.passphrase.file.encoding` is set to a non-empty value (like `IBM-1047`) and the agent is running on IBM zOS, the ssh passphrase file is written using that character set. The character sets of other credential files are not changed. The character sets on other operating systems are not changed.

Default is empty so that zOS file encoding behaves as it did previously.

user.password.file.encoding

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.user.password.file.encoding` is set to a non-empty value (like `IBM-1047`) and the agent is running on IBM zOS, the password file is written using that character set. The character sets of other credential files are not changed. The character sets on other operating systems are not changed.

Default is empty so that zOS file encoding behaves as it did previously.

useSETSID

When `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gitclient.CliGitAPIImpl.useSETSID` is set to `true` and the `setsid` command is available, the git client process on non-Windows computers will be started with the `setsid` command so that they are detached from any controlling terminal. Most agents are run without a controlling terminal and the `useSETSID` setting is not needed. Enable `useSETSID` only in those rare cases where the agent is running with a controlling terminal. If it is not used in those cases, the agent may block on some authenticated git operations.

This setting can be helpful with [Jenkins swarm agents](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm/) and inbound agents started from a terminal emulator.

Default is `false` so that `setsid` is not used.

SECURITY-1534 / CVE-2019-10392
Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation
of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the
specified URL. This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the
Jenkins master as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

SECURITY-1538 / CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
any of the following:

- Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
- Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of
  assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
- Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement
  expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
- Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not
  involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1476 / CVE-2019-10395
Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables
shown on its views. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment
variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

SECURITY-1489 / CVE-2019-10396
Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest
Builds View. This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability
exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on
that view.

SECURITY-1509 / CVE-2019-10397
Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job
configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1545 / CVE-2019-10398
Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins
master. This password could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

## Descriptions

### System command execution vulnerability in Git client Plugin

**SECURITY-1534
/
CVE-2019-10392**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`git-client`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git-client)**

**Description:**

Git client Plugin accepts user-specified values as argument to an invocation of `git ls-remote` to validate the existence of a Git repository at the specified URL.
This was implemented in a way that allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to execute an arbitrary system command on the Jenkins controller as the OS user that the Jenkins process is running as.

Git client Plugin now rejects repository URLs that do not appear to be valid URLs.
Additionally, for versions of Git that support it, the repository URL argument is separated from option arguments using the `--` separator to prevent interpretation as an option.

As of publication of this advisory, no update for users of prerelease versions of 3.x such as 3.0.0-rc is available.
Users of Git client Plugin 3.0.0-rc are advised to downgrade to 2.8.5 (and downgrade [Git Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/git) from 4.0.0-rc to the latest 3.x release to resolve dependency problems).

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1538
/
CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10394, CVE-2019-10399, CVE-2019-10400**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through any of the following:

* Crafted method names in method call expressions (CVE-2019-10393)
* Crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of assignment expressions (CVE-2019-10394)
* Crafted property names in property expressions in increment and decrement expressions (CVE-2019-10399)
* Crafted subexpressions in increment and decrement expressions not involving actual assignment (CVE-2019-10400)

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Build Environment Plugin

**SECURITY-1476
/
CVE-2019-10395**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`build-environment`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-environment)**

**Description:**

Build Environment Plugin did not escape values of environment variables shown on its views.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the values of build environment variables, typically users with Job/Configure or Job/Build permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

Build Environment Plugin now escapes all variables displayed in its views.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Dashboard View Plugin

**SECURITY-1489
/
CVE-2019-10396**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dashboard-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dashboard-view)**

**Description:**

Dashboard View Plugin did not escape the build description on the Latest Builds View.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the description of builds shown on that view.

Dashboard View Plugin now applies the configured markup formatter to the build description, rendering it as it appears elsewhere in Jenkins.

### Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin showed plain text password in job configuration form fields

**SECURITY-1509
/
CVE-2019-10397**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`aqua-serverless`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-serverless)**

**Description:**

Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin stores service passwords in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin no longer transmits the password form field in plain text.

### Beaker builder Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1545
/
CVE-2019-10398**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`beaker-builder`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/beaker-builder)**

**Description:**

Beaker builder Plugin stored the Beaker password unencrypted on the Jenkins controller.
This password could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Beaker builder Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted.

## User’s guide

(adapted from information on [Template plugin in CloudBees Plugins guide](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/admin-resources/latest/plugins/template#template-sect-script-approval))

Various Jenkins plugins require that users define custom scripts, most commonly in the Groovy language, to customize Jenkins’s behavior. If everyone who writes these scripts is a Jenkins administrator—specifically if they have the Overall/RunScripts permission, used for example by the Script Console link—then they can write whatever scripts they like. These scripts may directly refer to internal Jenkins objects using the same API offered to plugins. Such users must be completely trusted, as they can do anything to Jenkins (even changing its security settings or running shell commands on the server).

However, if some script authors are “regular users” with only more limited permissions, such as Job/Configure, it is inappropriate to let them run arbitrary scripts. To support such a division of roles, the Script Security library plugin can be integrated into various feature plugins. It supports two related systems: script approval, and Groovy sandboxing.

### Script Approval

The first, and simpler, security system is to allow any kind of script to be run, but only with an administrator’s approval. There is a globally maintained list of approved scripts which are judged to not perform any malicious actions.

When a user saves some kind of configuration (for example, a job), there will be appropriate warnings indicating that approval is required. Administrators may approve those scripts using the Script Approval configuration page or following the approval link in the configuration. In previous versions of Script Security Plugin, scripts saved by administrators where automatically approved when saving them, but this functionality was disabled to prevent a variety of social engineering-based attacks. (“Saving” usually means from the web UI, but could also mean uploading a new XML configuration via REST or CLI.) or merely by creating a new item copying an existing one.

When a user saves a template configuration, a check is done whether any contained scripts have been edited from an approved text. (More precisely, whether the requested content has ever been approved before.) If it has not been approved, a request for approval of this script is added to a queue. (A warning is also displayed in the configuration screen UI when the current text of a script is not currently approved.)

An administrator may now go to *Manage Jenkins » In-process Script Approval* where a list of scripts pending approval will be shown. Assuming nothing dangerous-looking is being requested, just click Approve to let the script be run henceforth.

If you try to run an unapproved script, it will simply fail, typically with a message explaining that it is pending approval. You may retry once the script has been approved. The details of this behavior may vary according to the feature plugin integrating this library.

### Groovy Sandboxing

Waiting for an administrator to approve every change to a script, no matter how seemingly trivial, could be unacceptable in a team spread across timezones or during tight deadlines. As an alternative option, the Script Security system lets Groovy scripts be run without approval so long as they limit themselves to operations considered inherently safe. This limited execution environment is called a sandbox. (Currently no sandbox implementations are available for other languages, so all such scripts must be approved if configured by non-administrators.)

To switch to this mode, simply check the box Use Groovy Sandbox below the Groovy script’s entry field. Sandboxed scripts can be run immediately by anyone. (Even administrators, though the script is subject to the same restrictions regardless of who wrote it.) When the script is run, every method call, object construction, and field access is checked against a whitelist of approved operations. If an unapproved operation is attempted, the script is killed and the corresponding Jenkins feature cannot be used yet.

The Script Security plugin ships with a small default whitelist, and integrating plugins may add operations to that list (typically methods specific to that plugin).

But you are not limited to the default whitelist: every time a script fails before running an operation that is not yet whitelisted, that operation is automatically added to another approval queue. An administrator can go to the same page described above for approval of entire scripts, and see a list of pending operation approvals. If Approve is clicked next to the signature of an operation, it is immediately added to the whitelist and available for sandboxed scripts.

Most signatures be of the form `method class.Name methodName arg1Type arg2Type…`, indicating a Java method call with a specific “receiver” class (this), method name, and list of argument (or parameter) types. (The most general signature of an attempted method call will be offered for approval, even when the actual object it was to be called on was of a more specific type overriding that method.) You may also see `staticMethod` for static (class) methods, `new` for constructors, and `field` for field accesses (get or set).

Administrators in security-sensitive environments should carefully consider which operations to whitelist. Operations which change state of persisted objects (such as Jenkins jobs) should generally be denied. Most `getSomething` methods are harmless.

In case of highly secured environments, where only sandbox scripts are allowed, the option "Force the use of the sandbox globally in the system" allows forcing the use of the sandbox globally in the system and will block the creation of new items in the "In-process Script Approval" screen.

### ACL-aware methods

Be aware however that even some “getter” methods are designed to check specific permissions (using an ACL: access control list), whereas scripts are often run by a system pseudo-user to whom all permissions are granted. So for example `method hudson.model.AbstractItem getParent` (which obtains the folder or Jenkins root containing a job) is in and of itself harmless, but the possible follow-up call `method hudson.model.ItemGroup getItems` (which lists jobs by name within a folder) checks Job/Read. This second call would be dangerous to whitelist unconditionally, since it would mean that a user who is granted Job/Create in a folder would be able to read at least some information from any jobs in that folder, even those which are supposed to be hidden according to a project-based authorization strategy; it would suffice to create a job in the folder which includes a Groovy script like this (details would vary according to the integrating plugin):

`println("I sniffed ${thisjob.getParent().getItems()}!");`

When run, the script output would display at least the names of supposedly secret projects. An administrator may instead click Approve assuming permission check for `getItems`; this will permit the call when run as an actual user (if the integrating plugin ever does so), while forbidding it when run as the system user (which is more typical). In this case, `getItems` is actually implemented to return only those jobs which the current user has access to, so if run in the former case (as a specific user), the description will show just those jobs they could see anyway. This more advanced button is shown only for method calls (and constructors), and should be used only where you know that Jenkins is doing a permission check.

## Developer’s guide

[Complete example integration](https://github.com/jenkinsci/groovy-postbuild-plugin/pull/11/files)

### The easy way

For a typical Groovy integration, in which you offer the user the option of using either script approval or the sandbox, change your describable’s String-valued script field into a SecureGroovyScript field. In your constructor, before storing the value, call `configuringWithKeyItem` (if there could only be one such script per top-level item) or configuringWithNonKeyItem (if there might be several). The configuration form should use `<f:property field="…"/>` to pick up the script and sandbox configuration. When you want to run the script, just call evaluate.

(For compatibility with old data, pick a different field name and deprecate the original. Then you can define a readResolve method which sets the new field to a SecureGroovyScript with the sandbox off, calls `configuring(ApprovalContext.create())` on it to notify the system that an unapproved script has been loaded, and unsets the old field.)

### The hard way

To be used if you need more control than SecureGroovyScript offers:

Introduce a boolean sandbox field into your configuration.

When unset, you need to call `ScriptApproval.configuring` in the `@DataBoundConstructor`. Use `ApprovalContext.withCurrentUser`, and also `withItemAsKey` where applicable (when there is just one script per job); otherwise at least withItem where applicable, and/or `withKey` when you can uniquely identify this usage from the context (`StaplerRequest.findAncestorObject` is helpful here). This lets the system know a (possibly) new script has been configured by a particular person. You will also need a `readResolve` that calls configuring to notify the system when a configurable with script has been loaded from disk (and thus the configurer is unknown). Call `ScriptApproval.using` when the script is run, and catch `UnapprovedUsageException` if necessary. The descriptor should use form validation on the script field and call `ScriptApproval.checking` (generally your descriptor should already be doing at least a syntax check on this field).

When the sandbox field is set, you need merely set up the Groovy shell with `GroovySandbox.createSecureCompilerConfiguration` and then call `GroovySandbox.run`; be prepared to catch `RejectedAccessException` and call `ScriptApproval.accessRejected`.

### Preapproved methods for the sandbox

To preapprove some particular method calls, simply annotate them with @Whitelisted if in your plugin; otherwise you can register (with `@Extension`) a ProxyWhitelist delegating to StaticWhitelist.from and loading a text file listing whitelisted methods.

### Classpath for evaluating scripts

When constructing a GroovyShell to evaluate a script, or calling `ecureGroovyScript.evaluate`, you must pass a `ClassLoader` which represents the effective classpath for the script. You could use the loader of Jenkins core, or your plugin, or `Jenkins.getInstance().getPluginManager().uberClassLoader`.

Whatever you choose, do not allow an unprivileged user to add arbitrary classpath entries by making a `URLClassLoader`! This would make it trivial to bypass all security when using the sandbox. (A user need merely make this or another job archive a JAR containing some class with a static method marked `@Whitelisted` and doing whatever they like, then call the method from their script.) No attack has yet been demonstrated when using whole-script approval—a `URLClassLoader` with normal parent-first delegation would not permit trivial masking of innocent-looking APIs by compromised versions—but it is likely that some clever use of `META-INF/services/org.codehaus.groovy.transform.ASTTransformation` or similar could cause an otherwise safe script to behave in an unexpected and unauthorized manner. [JENKINS-22834](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22834) suggests a safe standard alternative.

### Unit tests

When writing tests for plug-ins that use the Script Security Plugin you may encounter some errors in your tests.

If your tests call, direct or indirectly, the `ScriptApproval.get()` method, then your unit tests must use JenkinsRule so that `Jenkins.getInstance()` does not return null. It is likely that tests that were working now start to fail if you are not using the sandbox. It occurs because they are being enqueued for approval. In case you need to execute scripts regardless of approvals, `ScriptApproval.get().preapprove(script, GroovyLanguage.get())` will ensure that all configured scripts are approved. Alternately, you can have your tests run scripts using the sandbox. In this case you may need to whitelist methods used by your tests -- either generally for real users, or using a `@TestExtension` to have a whitelist just for tests.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |
