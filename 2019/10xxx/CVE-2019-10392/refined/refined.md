Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10392:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Git client Plugin accepted user-specified values as arguments to the `git ls-remote` command without proper sanitization. This allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary system commands by crafting a malicious URL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The plugin failed to properly sanitize user-provided input when constructing the `git ls-remote` command, allowing the execution of arbitrary system commands. Specifically, it did not prevent the use of parameters that are interpreted as options by git when these were part of the provided URL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker with "Job/Configure" permission could execute arbitrary system commands on the Jenkins controller (master) as the OS user that the Jenkins process was running under. This can lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins instance.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Git URL:** The attack vector is a crafted Git repository URL, which could be set within the job configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Job/Configure Permission:** An attacker needed the "Job/Configure" permission within Jenkins to modify the job configuration and insert the malicious Git URL.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involved rejecting repository URLs that don't appear to be valid URLs, and separating the repository URL argument from option arguments using the `--` separator (where supported by the version of Git).
- The vulnerability was present in Git client Plugin versions 2.8.4 and earlier.
- It was addressed in version 2.8.5.
