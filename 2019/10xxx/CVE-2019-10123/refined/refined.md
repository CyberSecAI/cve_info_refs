{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "SQL injection vulnerability in the login process of the AIS ESEL-Server, which is a backend component used by the AIS logistics software.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "SQL injection"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote code execution on the server hosting the AIS logistics software. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the target system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious SQL queries during the login process of the AIS mobile application's backend. The server typically listens on port 5099 without TLS. Although port 5100 is sometimes used with TLS, port 5099 is usually always open.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server (typically listening on port 5099). No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection."
