| [Description](#c0)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 12:06:59 UTC  ```  Incoming details. ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 12:09:54 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-10149 Exim 4.87 to 4.91 ================================  We received a report of a possible remote exploit.  Currently there is no evidenice of an active use of this exploit.  A patch exists already, is being tested, and backported to all versions we released since (and including) 4.87.  The severity depends on your configuration.  It depends on how close to the standard configuration your Exim runtime configuration is. The closer the better.  Exim 4.92 is not vulnerable.  Next steps:  * t0:    Distros will get access to our non-public security Git repo          (access is granted based on the SSH keys that are known to us)  * t0+7d: Coordinated Release Date: Distros should push the patched          version to their repos. The Exim maintainers will publish          the fixed source to the official and public Git repo.  t0    is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC t0+7d is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC   Timeline --------  * 2019-05-27 Report from Qualys to exim-security list * 2019-05-27 Patch provided by Jeremy Harris * 2019-05-29 CVE-2019-10149 assigned from Qualys via RedHat * 2019-06-03 This announcement ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Hanno Böck   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 13:57:08 UTC  ``` To clarify this: Details of the vulnerability are not public yet (will be in ~1week), but it seems the latest version 4.92 is unaffected (which seems to be by coincidence, because this version is older than the discovery of the vuln).  We already have 4.92 in the tree, so stabilizing that gives us an option to protect users without knowing the details of the vuln.  @maintainers: Can we go on with stabilizing? ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  Fabian Groffen   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 13:59:45 UTC  ``` yes, 4.92 runs for a while on my servers, it's ready to go stable IMO. ```  [Comment 4](#c4)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 15:57:42 UTC  ``` Like discussed with maintainer, Gentoo will move to >=mail-mta/exim-4.92.  @ Arches,  please test and mark stable: =mail-mta/exim-4.92 ```  [Comment 5](#c5)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 17:19:48 UTC  ``` x86 stable ```  [Comment 6](#c6)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2019-06-04 18:56:29 UTC  ``` ppc64 stable ```  [Comment 7](#c7)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2019-06-05 06:51:03 UTC  ``` amd64 stable ```  [Comment 8](#c8)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2019-06-05 07:15:24 UTC  ``` ppc stable ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-06-05 17:27:53 UTC  ``` From Qualys Security Advisory:  ======================================================================== Summary ========================================================================  During a code review of the latest changes in the Exim mail server (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim>), we discovered an RCE vulnerability in versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). In this particular case, RCE means Remote *Command* Execution, not Remote Code Execution: an attacker can execute arbitrary commands with execv(), as root; no memory corruption or ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) is involved.  This vulnerability is exploitable instantly by a local attacker (and by a remote attacker in certain non-default configurations). To remotely exploit this vulnerability in the default configuration, an attacker must keep a connection to the vulnerable server open for 7 days (by transmitting one byte every few minutes). However, because of the extreme complexity of Exim's code, we cannot guarantee that this exploitation method is unique; faster methods may exist.  Exim is vulnerable by default since version 4.87 (released on April 6, 2016), when #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT became #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT; and older versions may also be vulnerable if EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT was enabled manually. Surprisingly, this vulnerability was fixed in version 4.92 (released on February 10, 2019):  <https://github.com/Exim/exim/commit/7ea1237c783e380d7bdb86c90b13d8203c7ecf26> <https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310>  but was not identified as a security vulnerability, and most operating systems are therefore affected. For example, we exploit an up-to-date Debian distribution (9.9) in this advisory. ```  [Comment 10](#c10)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-06-05 17:36:53 UTC  ``` New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 11](#c11)  Rolf Eike Beer   archtester  2019-06-05 17:56:41 UTC  ``` sparc stable ```  [Comment 12](#c12)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2019-06-06 06:55:36 UTC  ``` ia64 stable ```  [Comment 13](#c13)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2019-06-06 17:33:01 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 201906-01 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201906-01> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-06-06 17:33:34 UTC  ``` Re-opening for remaining arches. ```  [Comment 15](#c15)  Rolf Eike Beer   archtester  2019-06-06 20:39:17 UTC  ``` hppa stable ```  [Comment 16](#c16)  Agostino Sarubbo   gentoo-dev  2019-06-08 18:21:27 UTC  ``` alpha stable ```  [Comment 17](#c17)  Markus Meier   gentoo-dev  2019-06-13 04:28:36 UTC  ``` arm stable, all arches done. ```  [Comment 18](#c18)  zain david    2019-07-31 01:30:25 UTC  ``` very great post. <http://www.winmilliongame.com> <http://www.gtagame100.com> <http://www.subway-game.com> <http://www.zumagame100.com> ```  [Comment 19](#c19)  Aaron Bauman (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2019-08-02 00:41:34 UTC  ``` @maintainer(s), please clean. ```  [Comment 20](#c20)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2019-08-02 06:44:32 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=e4104b9c4bd8cbaba4712e6a8d4e6c8d120ba5c0>  commit e4104b9c4bd8cbaba4712e6a8d4e6c8d120ba5c0 Author:     Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2019-08-02 06:42:47 +0000 Commit:     Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2019-08-02 06:42:47 +0000      mail-mta/exim: cleanup vulnerable CVE-2019-10149          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/687336>     Package-Manager: Portage-2.3.66, Repoman-2.3.16     Signed-off-by: Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org>   mail-mta/exim/Manifest                             |   2 -  mail-mta/exim/exim-4.91-r2.ebuild                  | 561 ---------------------  .../exim/files/exim-4.74-localscan_dlopen.patch    | 262 ----------  3 files changed, 825 deletions(-) ```  [Comment 22](#c22)  Michał Górny   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-01-22 13:28:11 UTC  ``` (spam) ```  [Comment 24](#c24)  Michał Górny   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-03-28 06:52:00 UTC  ``` (more spam) ```  [Comment 30](#c30)  alishakihn    2023-04-14 01:03:06 UTC  ``` (In reply to Larry the Git Cow from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=687336#c20)) > The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s): >  > <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/> >  <https://flappy-bird.io> > ?id=e4104b9c4bd8cbaba4712e6a8d4e6c8d120ba5c0 >  > commit e4104b9c4bd8cbaba4712e6a8d4e6c8d120ba5c0 > Author:     Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> > AuthorDate: 2019-08-02 06:42:47 +0000 > Commit:     Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> > CommitDate: 2019-08-02 06:42:47 +0000 >  >     mail-mta/exim: cleanup vulnerable CVE-2019-10149  >      >     Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/687336> >     Package-Manager: Portage-2.3.66, Repoman-2.3.16 >     Signed-off-by: Fabian Groffen <grobian@gentoo.org> >  >  mail-mta/exim/Manifest                             |   2 - >  mail-mta/exim/exim-4.91-r2.ebuild                  | 561 > --------------------- >  .../exim/files/exim-4.74-localscan_dlopen.patch    | 262 ---------- >  3 files changed, 825 deletions(-)  Thank you! ```   [Comment 31](#c31)  xavadaf906    2023-06-19 12:41:48 UTC  Comment hidden (spam)  ``` Try this styish novak jacket 23 The Novak Jacket 23 is a must-have for anyone looking to make a fashion statement.

Now you have updated stats, but you've dropped all of the detail. :-(

CVE-2019-10149 Exim 4.87 to 4.91
================================
We received a report of a possible remote exploit. Currently there is no
evidence of an active use of this exploit.
A patch exists already, is being tested, and backported to all
versions we released since (and including) 4.87.
The severity depends on your configuration. It depends on how close to
the standard configuration your Exim runtime configuration is. The
closer the better.
Exim 4.92 is not vulnerable.
Next steps:
\* t0: Distros will get access to our non-public security Git repo
(access is granted based on the SSH keys that are known to us)
\* t0+7d: Coordinated Release Date: Distros should push the patched
version to their repos. The Exim maintainers will publish
the fixed source to the official and public Git repo.
t0 is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC
t0+7d is expected to be 2019-06-11, 10:00 UTC
UPDATE: Details leaked, CRD is re-scheduled to 2019-06-05 15:15 UTC.

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

We recently audited central parts of the Exim mail server
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim>) and discovered 21 vulnerabilities
(from CVE-2020-28007 to CVE-2020-28026, plus CVE-2021-27216): 11 local
vulnerabilities, and 10 remote vulnerabilities. Unless otherwise noted,
all versions of Exim are affected since at least the beginning of its
Git history, in 2004.

We have not tried to exploit all of these vulnerabilities, but we
successfully exploited 4 LPEs (Local Privilege Escalations) and 3 RCEs
(Remote Code Executions):

- CVE-2020-28007 (LPE, from user "exim" to root);

- CVE-2020-28008 (LPE, from user "exim" to root);

- CVE-2020-28015 (LPE, from any user to root);

- CVE-2020-28012 (LPE, from any user to root, if allow_filter is true);

- CVE-2020-28020 (unauthenticated RCE as "exim", in Exim < 4.92);

- CVE-2020-28018 (unauthenticated RCE as "exim", in 4.90 <= Exim < 4.94,
  if TLS encryption is provided by OpenSSL);

- CVE-2020-28021 (authenticated RCE, as root);

- CVE-2020-28017 is also exploitable (unauthenticated RCE as "exim"),
  but requires more than 25GB of memory in the default configuration.

We will not publish our exploits for now; instead, we encourage other
security researchers to write and publish their own exploits:

- This advisory contains sufficient information to develop reliable
  exploits for these vulnerabilities; in fact, we believe that better
  exploitation methods exist.

- We hope that more security researchers will look into Exim's code and
  report their findings; indeed, we discovered several of these
  vulnerabilities while working on our exploits.

- We will answer (to the best of our abilities) any questions regarding
  these vulnerabilities and exploits on the public "oss-security" list
  (<https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security>).

Last-minute note: as explained in the Timeline, we developed a minimal
set of patches for these vulnerabilities; for reference and comparison,
it is attached to this advisory and is also available at
<https://www.qualys.com/research/security-advisories/>.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28007: Link attack in Exim's log directory
========================================================================

The Exim binary is set-user-ID-root, and Exim operates as root in its
log directory, which belongs to the "exim" user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxr-s--- 2 Debian-exim adm         4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/log/exim4
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user (by
exploiting CVE-2020-28020 or CVE-2020-28018 for example) can exploit
this local vulnerability to obtain full root privileges. Indeed, the
following code opens a log file in append mode, as root (lines 465-469):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  22 static uschar *log_names[] = { US"main", US"reject", US"panic", US"debug" };
 ...
 382 static void
 383 open_log(int *fd, int type, uschar *tag)
 384 {
 ...
 387 uschar buffer[LOG_NAME_SIZE];
 ...
 398 ok = string_format(buffer, sizeof(buffer), CS file_path, log_names[type]);
 ...
 465 *fd = Uopen(buffer,
 466 #ifdef O_CLOEXEC
 467                 O_CLOEXEC |
 468 #endif
 469                 O_APPEND|O_WRONLY, LOG_MODE);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The name of the log file in buffer is derived from file_path, which is
derived from log_file_path, a format string defined at compile time (or
re-defined by the configuration file). On Debian, log_file_path is

"panic", or "debug" at run time (line 398).

An attacker with the privileges of the "exim" user can create a symlink
(or a hardlink) in the log directory, append arbitrary contents to an
arbitrary file (to /etc/passwd, for example), and obtain full root

CVE-2020-28008: Assorted attacks in Exim's spool directory
========================================================================

Exim also operates as root in its spool directory, which belongs to the
"exim" user:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
drwxr-x--- 5 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4
drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/db

drwxr-x--- 2 Debian-exim Debian-exim 4096 Nov  4 06:16 /var/spool/exim4/msglog
------------------------------------------------------------------------

An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user can exploit
this local vulnerability to obtain full root privileges. Various attack
vectors exist:

- The attacker can directly write to a spool header file (in the "input"
  subdirectory) and reuse our exploitation technique for CVE-2020-28015.

- The attacker can create a long-named file in the "db" subdirectory and
  overflow a stack-based buffer (at line 208):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 87 open_db *
 88 dbfn_open(uschar *name, int flags, open_db *dbblock, BOOL lof)
 89 {

199   int namelen = Ustrlen(name);
200
201   *lastname = 0;
202   dd = opendir(CS filename);
203
204   while ((ent = readdir(dd)))
205     if (Ustrncmp(ent->d_name, name, namelen) == 0)

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28014: Arbitrary file creation and clobbering
========================================================================

An attacker who obtained the privileges of the "exim" user can abuse the
-oP override_pid_file_path option to create (or overwrite) an arbitrary
file, as root. The attacker does not, however, control the contents of
this file:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=107(Debian-exim) gid=114(Debian-exim) groups=114(Debian-exim)

/usr/sbin/exim4 -bdf -oX 0 -oP /etc/ld.so.preload &

-rw-r--r-- 1 root Debian-exim 5 Nov  4 20:20 /etc/ld.so.preload
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The attacker can also combine this vulnerability with CVE-2020-28007 or
CVE-2020-28008 to create an arbitrary file with arbitrary contents and
obtain full root privileges.

========================================================================
CVE-2021-27216: Arbitrary file deletion
========================================================================

While working on a patch for CVE-2020-28014, we discovered another
related vulnerability: any local user can delete any arbitrary file as
root (for example, /etc/passwd), by abusing the -oP and -oPX options in
delete_pid_file():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 932 void
 933 delete_pid_file(void)
 934 {
 935 uschar * daemon_pid = string_sprintf("%d\n", (int)getppid());
 ...
 939 if ((f = Ufopen(pid_file_path, "rb")))
 940   {
 941   if (  fgets(CS big_buffer, big_buffer_size, f)
 942         && Ustrcmp(daemon_pid, big_buffer) == 0
 943      )
 944     if (Uunlink(pid_file_path) == 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this vulnerability, a local attacker must win an easy race
condition between the fopen() at line 939 and the unlink() at line 944;
this is left as an exercise for the interested reader.

CVE-2020-28011: Heap buffer overflow in queue_run()

Through the -R deliver_selectstring and -S deliver_selectstring_sender

queue_run() (lines 419 and 423):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 412   p = big_buffer;
 ...
 418   if (deliver_selectstring)
 419     p += sprintf(CS p, " -R%s %s", f.deliver_selectstring_regex? "r" : "",
 420       deliver_selectstring);

CVE-2020-28010: Heap out-of-bounds write in main()
========================================================================

For debugging and logging purposes, Exim copies the current working
directory (initial_cwd) into the heap-based big_buffer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
3665 initial_cwd = os_getcwd(NULL, 0);
....
3945   uschar *p = big_buffer;
3946   Ustrcpy(p, "cwd= (failed)");
....
3952     Ustrncpy(p + 4, initial_cwd, big_buffer_size-5);
3953     p += 4 + Ustrlen(initial_cwd);
....
3956     *p = '\0';
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The strncpy() at line 3952 cannot overflow big_buffer, but (on Linux at
least) initial_cwd can be much longer than big_buffer_size (16KB): line
3953 can increase p past big_buffer's end, and line 3956 (and beyond)
can write out of big_buffer's bounds.

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unprivileged local attacker to obtain full root
privileges.

CVE-2020-28013: Heap buffer overflow in parse_fix_phrase()
========================================================================

If a local attacker executes Exim with a -F '.(' option (for example),
then parse_fix_phrase() calls strncpy() with a -1 size (which overflows
the destination buffer, because strncpy(dest, src, n) "writes additional
null bytes to dest to ensure that a total of n bytes are written").

Indeed, at line 1124 s and ss are both equal to end, at line 1125 ss is
decremented, and at line 1127 ss-s is equal to -1:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1124             {

CVE-2020-28015: New-line injection into spool header file (local)
========================================================================

When Exim receives a mail, it creates two files in the "input"
subdirectory of its spool directory: a "data" file, which contains the
body of the mail, and a "header" file, which contains the headers of the
mail and important metadata (the sender and the recipient addresses, for
example). Such a header file consists of lines of text separated by '\n'
characters.

Unfortunately, an unprivileged local attacker can send a mail to a
recipient whose address contains '\n' characters, and can therefore
inject new lines into the spool header file and change Exim's behavior:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
id
uid=1001(jane) gid=1001(jane) groups=1001(jane)

2020-11-05 09:11:46 1kafzO-0001ho-Tf Format error in spool file 1kafzO-0001ho-Tf-H: size=607
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The effect of this vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-8794 in
OpenSMTPD, but in Exim's case it is not enough to execute arbitrary
commands. To understand how we transformed this vulnerability into an
arbitrary command execution, we must digress briefly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Digression
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the vulnerabilities in this advisory are memory corruptions, and
despite modern protections such as ASLR, NX, and malloc hardening,
memory corruptions in Exim are easy to exploit:

1/ Exim's memory allocator (store.c, which calls malloc() and free()
internally) unintentionally provides attackers with powerful exploit
primitives. In particular, if an attacker can pass a negative size to
the allocator (through an integer overflow or direct control), then:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
119 static void *next_yield[NPOOLS];
120 static int yield_length[NPOOLS] = { -1, -1, -1,  -1, -1, -1 };
...
231 void *
232 store_get_3(int size, BOOL tainted, const char *func, int linenumber)
233 {
...
248 if (size > yield_length[pool])
249   {
...
294   }
...
299 store_last_get[pool] = next_yield[pool];
...
316 next_yield[pool] = (void *)(CS next_yield[pool] + size);
317 yield_length[pool] -= size;
318 return store_last_get[pool];
319 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1a/ At line 248, store_get() believes that the current block of memory
is large enough (because size is negative), and goes to line 299. As a
result, store_get()'s caller can overflow the current block of memory (a
"forward-overflow").

1b/ At line 317, the free size of the current block of memory
(yield_length) is mistakenly increased (because size is negative), and
at line 316, the next pointer returned by store_get() (next_yield) is
mistakenly decreased (because size is negative). As a result, the next
memory allocation can overwrite the beginning of Exim's heap: a relative
write-what-where, which naturally bypasses ASLR (a "backward-jump", or
"back-jump").

2/ The beginning of the heap contains Exim's configuration, which
includes various strings that are passed to expand_string() at run time.
Consequently, an attacker who can "back-jump" can overwrite these
strings with "${run{...}}" and execute arbitrary commands (thus
bypassing NX).

The first recorded use of expand_string() in an Exim exploit is
CVE-2010-4344 (and CVE-2010-4345), an important part of Internet
folklore:

<https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/12/10/1>

Note: Exim 4.94 (the latest version) introduces "tainted" memory (i.e.,
untrusted, possibly attacker-controlled data) and refuses to process it
in expand_string(). This mechanism protects Exim against unintentional
expansion of tainted data (CVE-2014-2957 and CVE-2019-10149), but NOT
against memory corruption: an attacker can simply overwrite untainted
memory with tainted data, and still execute arbitrary commands in
expand_string(). For example, we exploited CVE-2020-28015,
CVE-2020-28012, and CVE-2020-28021 in Exim 4.94.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CVE-2020-28015 allows us to inject new lines into a spool header file.
To transform this vulnerability into an arbitrary command execution (as
root, since deliver_drop_privilege is false by default), we exploit the
following code in spool_read_header():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 341 int n;
 ...
 910 while ((n = fgetc(fp)) != EOF)
 911   {
 ...
 914   int i;
 915
 916   if (!isdigit(n)) goto SPOOL_FORMAT_ERROR;
 917   if(ungetc(n, fp) == EOF  ||  fscanf(fp, "%d%c ", &n, flag) == EOF)
 918     goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
 ...
 927     h->text = store_get(n+1, TRUE);     /* tainted */
 ...
 935     for (i = 0; i < n; i++)
 936       {
 937       int c = fgetc(fp);
 ...
 940       h->text[i] = c;
 941       }
 942     h->text[i] = 0;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 917, we start a fake header with a negative length n;

- at line 927, we back-jump to the beginning of the heap (Digression
  1b), because n is negative;

- at line 935, we avoid the forward-overflow (Digression 1a), because n
  is negative;

- then, our next fake header is allocated to the beginning of the heap
  and overwrites Exim's configuration strings (with "${run{command}}");

- last, our arbitrary command is executed when deliver_message()
  processes our fake (injected) recipient and expands the overwritten
  configuration strings (Digression 2).

We can also transform CVE-2020-28015 into an information disclosure, by
exploiting the following code in spool_read_header():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 756 for (recipients_count = 0; recipients_count < rcount; recipients_count++)
 757   {
 ...
 765   if (Ufgets(big_buffer, big_buffer_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
 766   nn = Ustrlen(big_buffer);
 767   if (nn < 2) goto SPOOL_FORMAT_ERROR;
 ...
 772   p = big_buffer + nn - 1;
 773   *p-- = 0;
 ...
 809   while (isdigit(*p)) p--;
 ...
 840   else if (*p == '#')
 841     {
 842     int flags;
 ...
 848     (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d", &flags);
 849
 850     if ((flags & 0x01) != 0)      /* one_time data exists */
 851       {
 852       int len;
 853       while (isdigit(*(--p)) || *p == ',' || *p == '-');
 854       (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d,%d", &len, &pno);
 855       *p = 0;
 856       if (len > 0)
 857         {
 858         p -= len;
 859         errors_to = string_copy_taint(p, TRUE);
 860         }
 861       }
 862
 863     *(--p) = 0;   /* Terminate address */
------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example, if we send a mail to the recipient
'"X@...alhost\njane@...alhost 8192,-1#1\n\n1024* "' (where jane is our
username, and localhost is one of Exim's local_domains), then:

- at line 848, we set flags to 1;

- at line 854, we set len to 8KB;

- at line 858, we decrease p (by 8KB) toward the beginning of the heap;

- at line 859, we read the errors_to string out of big_buffer's bounds;

- finally, we receive our mail, which includes the out-of-bounds
  errors_to string in its "From" and "Return-path:" headers (in this
  example, errors_to contains a fragment of /etc/passwd):

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28012: Missing close-on-exec flag for privileged pipe
========================================================================

Exim supports a special kind of .forward file called "exim filter" (if
allow_filter is true, the default on Debian). To handle such a filter,
the privileged Exim process creates an unprivileged process and a pipe
for communication. The filter process can fork() and execute arbitrary
commands with expand_string(); this is not a security issue in itself,
because the filter process is unprivileged. Unfortunately, the writable
end of the communication pipe is not closed-on-exec and an unprivileged
local attacker can therefore send arbitrary data to the privileged Exim
process (which is running as root).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We exploit this vulnerability through the following code in
rda_interpret(), which reads our arbitrary data in the privileged Exim
process:

791 fd = pfd[pipe_read];
792 if (read(fd, filtertype, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int) ||
793     read(fd, &yield, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int) ||

958     status, readerror,
959     (*error == NULL)? US"" : US": error=",
960     (*error == NULL)? US"" : *error);
961   log_write(0, LOG_MAIN|LOG_PANIC, "%s", *error);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

where:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
467 static BOOL
468 rda_read_string(int fd, uschar **sp)
469 {
470 int len;
471
472 if (read(fd, &len, sizeof(int)) != sizeof(int)) return FALSE;
...
479   if (read(fd, *sp = store_get(len, FALSE), len) != len) return FALSE;
480 return TRUE;
481 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 794, we allocate an arbitrary string (of arbitrary length),
  error;

- at line 804 (and line 479), we back-jump to the beginning of the heap
  (Digression 1b) and avoid the forward-overflow (Digression 1a) because
  our len is negative;

- at line 956, we overwrite the beginning of the heap with a string that
  we control (error); we tried to overwrite Exim's configuration strings
  (Digression 2) but failed to execute arbitrary commands; instead, we
  overwrite file_path, a copy of log_file_path (mentioned in
  CVE-2020-28007);

- at line 961, we append an arbitrary string that we control (error) to
  a file whose name we control (file_path): we add an arbitrary user to
  /etc/passwd and obtain full root privileges.

This first version of our exploit succeeds on Debian oldstable's
exim4_4.89-2+deb9u7 (it fails on Debian stable's exim4_4.92-8+deb10u4
because of a gstring_reset_unused() in string_sprintf(); we have not
tried to work around this problem), but it fails on Debian testing's
exim4_4.94-8: the pool of memory that we back-jump at line 804 is
untainted, but the string at line 956 is tainted and written to a
different pool of memory (because our primary recipient, and hence
rname, are tainted).

To work around this problem, our "exim filter" generates a secondary
recipient that is naturally untainted (line 479). When this secondary
recipient is processed, the string at line 956 is untainted and thus
overwrites the beginning of the heap (because it is allocated in the
untainted pool of memory that we back-jumped at line 804): this second
version of our exploit also succeeds on Debian testing.

Finally, we use one noteworthy trick in our exploit: in theory, the
string that overwrites file_path at line 956 cannot be longer than 256
bytes (LOG_NAME_SIZE); this significantly slows our brute-force of the
correct back-jump distance. In practice, we can overwrite file_path with
a much longer string (up to 8KB, LOG_BUFFER_SIZE) because file_path is a
format string, and "%0Lu" (or "%.0D") is a NOP in Exim's string_format()
function: it consumes no argument and produces no output, thus avoiding
the overflow of buffer[LOG_NAME_SIZE] in open_log().

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28009: Integer overflow in get_stdinput()
========================================================================

The following loop reads lines from stdin as long as the last character
of the lines is '\\' (line 1273). Each line that is read is appended to
a "growable string", the gstring g (at line 1266):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1229 gstring * g = NULL;
....
1233 for (i = 0;; i++)
1234   {
1235   uschar buffer[1024];
....
1252     if (Ufgets(buffer, sizeof(buffer), stdin) == NULL) break;
1253     p = buffer;
....
1258   ss = p + (int)Ustrlen(p);
....
1266   g = string_catn(g, p, ss - p);
....
1273   if (ss == p || g->s[g->ptr-1] != '\\')
1274     break;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Eventually, the integer g->size of the growable string overflows, and
becomes negative (in gstring_grow(), which is called by string_catn()).
Consequently, in store_newblock() (which is called by gstring_grow()),
newsize is negative:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
506 void *
507 store_newblock_3(void * block, int newsize, int len,
508   const char * filename, int linenumber)
509 {
510 BOOL release_ok = store_last_get[store_pool] == block;
511 uschar * newtext = store_get(newsize);
512
513 memcpy(newtext, block, len);
514 if (release_ok) store_release_3(block, filename, linenumber);
515 return (void *)newtext;
516 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- the store_get() at line 511 back-jumps the current block of memory
  (Digression 1b);

- the memcpy() at line 513 forward-overflows the current block of memory
  (Digression 1a).

If exploitable, this vulnerability would allow an unprivileged local
attacker to obtain full root privileges. We have not tried to exploit
this vulnerability, because it took more than 5 days to overflow the
integer g->size. Indeed, the loop in get_stdinput() has an O(n^2) time
complexity: for each line that is read, store_newblock() allocates a new
block of memory (at line 511) and recopies the entire contents of the
growable string (at line 513).

CVE-2020-28017: Integer overflow in receive_add_recipient()
========================================================================

By default, Exim does not limit the number of recipients (the number of
valid RCPT TO commands) for a mail. But after 52428800 (50M) recipients,
the multiplication at line 492 overflows, and the size that is passed to
store_get() becomes negative (2*50M * 40B = -96MB):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 484 void
 485 receive_add_recipient(uschar *recipient, int pno)
 486 {
 487 if (recipients_count >= recipients_list_max)
 488   {
 489   recipient_item *oldlist = recipients_list;
 490   int oldmax = recipients_list_max;
 491   recipients_list_max = recipients_list_max ? 2*recipients_list_max : 50;
 492   recipients_list = store_get(recipients_list_max * sizeof(recipient_item));
 493   if (oldlist != NULL)
 494     memcpy(recipients_list, oldlist, oldmax * sizeof(recipient_item));
 495   }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 492, store_get() back-jumps the current block of memory
  (Digression 1b), by -96MB;

- at line 494, memcpy() forward-overflows the current block of memory
  (Digression 1a), by nearly 2GB (50M * 40B = 2000MB).

Initially, we thought that CVE-2020-28017 would be the perfect
vulnerability:

- it affects all versions of Exim (since at least the beginning of its
  Git history in 2004);

- it is certainly exploitable (an unauthenticated RCE as the "exim"
  user): the forward-overflow can be absorbed to avoid a crash, and the
  back-jump can be directed onto Exim's configuration (Digression 2);

- a back-of-the-envelope calculation suggested that an exploit would
  require "only" 6GB of memory: 2*2GB for all the recipients_lists, and
  2GB of recipient addresses to absorb the forward-overflow.

Eventually, however, we abandoned the exploitation of CVE-2020-28017:

- On Exim 4.89 (Debian oldstable), the ACLs (Access Control Lists) for
  the RCPT TO command consume approximately 512 bytes per recipient: an
  exploit would require more than 50M * 512B = 25GB of memory. Instead,
  we decided to exploit another vulnerability, CVE-2020-28020, which
  requires only 3GB of memory.

- On Exim 4.92 (Debian stable), the ACLs for RCPT TO consume at least
  4KB per recipient. Indeed, this version's string_sprintf() allocates a
  whole new 32KB memory block, but uses only one page (4KB): an exploit
  would require more than 50M * 4KB = 200GB of memory.

- On Exim 4.94 (Debian testing), the problem with string_sprintf() was
  solved, and an exploit would therefore require "only" 25GB of memory.
  However, the "tainted" checks create another problem: each RCPT TO
  allocates T blocks of tainted memory, and makes U is_tainted() checks
  on untainted memory, but each check traverses the complete linked list
  of tainted memory blocks. For n recipients, this has an O(n^2) time
  complexity (roughly U*T*(n^2)/2): it would take months to reach 50M
  recipients.

CVE-2020-28017 is also exploitable locally (through -bS and
smtp_setup_batch_msg(), which does not have ACLs), and would allow an
unprivileged local attacker to obtain the privileges of the "exim" user.
But better vulnerabilities exist: CVE-2020-28015 and CVE-2020-28012 are
locally exploitable and yield full root privileges.

CVE-2020-28020: Integer overflow in receive_msg()
========================================================================

During our work on Exim, we stumbled across the following commit:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit 56ac062a3ff94fc4e1bbfc2293119c079a4e980b
Date:   Thu Jan 10 21:15:11 2019 +0000
...
+JH/41 Fix the loop reading a message header line to check for integer overflow,
+      and more-often against header_maxsize.  Previously a crafted message could
+      induce a crash of the recive process; now the message is cleanly rejected.
...
+    if (header_size >= INT_MAX/2)
+      goto OVERSIZE;
     header_size *= 2;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This vulnerability is exploitable in all Exim versions before 4.92 and
allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands
as the "exim" user. Because this commit was not identified as a security
patch, it was not backported to LTS (Long Term Support) distributions.
For example, Debian oldstable's package (exim4_4.89-2+deb9u7) contains
all known security patches, but is vulnerable to CVE-2020-28020 and
hence remotely exploitable.

By default, Exim limits the size of a mail header to 1MB
(header_maxsize). Unfortunately, an attacker can bypass this limit by
sending only continuation lines (i.e., '\n' followed by ' ' or '\t'),
thereby overflowing the integer header_size at line 1782:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1778   if (ptr >= header_size - 4)
1779     {
1780     int oldsize = header_size;
1781     /* header_size += 256; */
1782     header_size *= 2;
1783     if (!store_extend(next->text, oldsize, header_size))
1784       {
1785       BOOL release_ok = store_last_get[store_pool] == next->text;
1786       uschar *newtext = store_get(header_size);
1787       memcpy(newtext, next->text, ptr);
1788       if (release_ok) store_release(next->text);
1789       next->text = newtext;
1790       }
1791     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ironically, this vulnerability was the most difficult to exploit:

- when the integer header_size overflows, it becomes negative (INT_MIN),
  but we cannot exploit the resulting back-jump at line 1786 (Digression
  1b), because the free size of the current memory block also becomes
  negative (because 0 - INT_MIN = INT_MIN, the "Leblancian Paradox"),
  which prevents us from writing to this back-jumped memory block;

- to overflow the integer header_size, we must send 1GB to Exim:
  consequently, our exploit must succeed after only a few tries (in
  particular, we cannot brute-force ASLR).

Note: we can actually overflow header_size with 1GB / 2 = 512MB; if we
send a first line that ends with "\r\n", then Exim transforms every bare
'\n' that we send into "\n " (a continuation line):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1814   if (ch == '\n')
1815     {
1816     if (first_line_ended_crlf == TRUE_UNSET) first_line_ended_crlf = FALSE;
1817       else if (first_line_ended_crlf) receive_ungetc(' ');

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To exploit this vulnerability (on Debian oldstable, for example):

1/ We send three separate mails (in the same SMTP session) to achieve
the following memory layout:

                              mmap memory
-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----
 ... |n|l|    mblock3    |n|l|    mblock2    |n|l|    mblock1    | ...
-----|-------------------|-------------------|+------------------|-----
                                              |
                              heap memory     |
                    -------------------------|v-------------|-----
                     ... |N|L|N|L|N|L|N|L|N|L|n|l|  hblock  | ...
                    -------------------------|--------------|-----
                         <- fake storeblock ->

where n and l are the next and length members of a storeblock structure
(a linked list of allocated memory blocks):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 71 typedef struct storeblock {
 72   struct storeblock *next;
 73   size_t length;
 74 } storeblock;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- we first allocate a 1GB mmap block (mblock1) by sending a mail that
  contains a 256MB header of bare '\n' characters; the next member of
  mblock1's storeblock structure initially points to a heap block
  (hblock, which immediately follows data that we control);

- we allocate a second 1GB mmap block (mblock2) by sending a mail that
  also contains a 256MB header of bare '\n' characters;

- we allocate a third 1GB mmap block (mblock3) by sending a mail that
  contains a 512MB header; this overflows the integer header_size, and
  forward-overflows mblock3 (Digression 1a), into mblock2 and mblock1:
  we overwrite mblock2's next pointer with NULL (to avoid a crash in
  store_release() at line 1788) and we partially overwrite mblock1's
  next pointer (with a single null byte).

2/ After this overflow, store_reset() traverses the linked list of
allocated memory blocks and follows mblock1's overwritten next pointer,
to our own "fake storeblock" structure: a NULL next pointer N (to avoid
a crash in store_reset()), and a large length L that covers the entire
address space (for example, 0x7050505070505050). As a result, Exim's
allocator believes that the entire heap is one large, free block of
POOL_MAIN memory (Exim's main type of memory allocations).

This powerful exploit primitive gives us write access to the entire
heap, through POOL_MAIN allocations. But the heap also contains other
types of allocations: we exploit this primitive to overwrite POOL_MAIN
allocations with raw malloc()s (for information disclosure) and to
overwrite POOL_PERM allocations with POOL_MAIN allocations (for
arbitrary code execution).

3/ Information disclosure:

- First, we send an EHLO command that allocates a large string in raw
  malloc() memory.

- Second, we send an invalid RCPT TO command that allocates a small
  string in POOL_MAIN memory (an error message); this small POOL_MAIN
  string overwrites the beginning of the large malloc() string.

- Next, we send an invalid EHLO command that free()s the large malloc()
  string; this free() overwrites the beginning of the small POOL_MAIN
  string with a pointer to the libc (a member of libc's malloc_chunk
  structure).

- Last, we send an invalid DATA command that responds with an error
  message: the small, overwritten POOL_MAIN string, and hence the libc
  pointer. This information leak is essentially the technique that we
  used for CVE-2015-0235 (GHOST).

4/ Arbitrary code execution:

- First, we start a new mail (MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA commands);
  this calls dkim_exim_verify_init() and allocates a pdkim_ctx structure
  in POOL_PERM memory (DKIM is enabled by default since Exim 4.70):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
249 typedef struct pdkim_ctx {
...
263   int(*dns_txt_callback)(char *, char *);
...
274 } pdkim_ctx;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Second, we send a mail header that is allocated to POOL_MAIN memory,
  and overwrite the pdkim_ctx structure: we overwrite dns_txt_callback
  with a pointer to libc's system() function (we derive this pointer
  from the information-leaked libc pointer).

- Next, we send a "DKIM-Signature:" header (we particularly care about
  its "selector" field).

- Last, we end our mail; this calls dkim_exim_verify_finish(), which
  calls the overwritten dns_txt_callback with a first argument that we
  control (through the selector field of our "DKIM-Signature:" header):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1328 dns_txt_name = string_sprintf("%s._domainkey.%s.", sig->selector, sig->domain);
....
1333 if (  ctx->dns_txt_callback(CS dns_txt_name, CS dns_txt_reply) != PDKIM_OK
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  In other words, we execute system() with an arbitrary command.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28023: Out-of-bounds read in smtp_setup_msg()
========================================================================

In smtp_setup_msg(), which reads the SMTP commands sent by a client to
the Exim server:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1455 int     smtp_ch_index          = 0;
....
1459 uschar  smtp_connection_had[SMTP_HBUFF_SIZE];
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 126 #define HAD(n) \
 127     smtp_connection_had[smtp_ch_index++] = n; \
 128     if (smtp_ch_index >= SMTP_HBUFF_SIZE) smtp_ch_index = 0
....
5283     case DATA_CMD:
5284       HAD(SCH_DATA);
....
5305           smtp_printf("503 Valid RCPT command must precede %s\r\n", FALSE,
5306             smtp_names[smtp_connection_had[smtp_ch_index-1]]);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- line 5284 (line 128 in HAD()) can reset smtp_ch_index to 0 (an index
  into the circular buffer smtp_connection_had[]);

- line 5306 therefore reads smtp_connection_had[-1] out-of-bounds (an
  unsigned char index into the array smtp_names[]);

- depending on the value of this unsigned char index, line 5306 may also
  read smtp_names[smtp_connection_had[-1]] out-of-bounds (a pointer to a
  string);

- and line 5305 sends this string to the SMTP client and may therefore
  disclose sensitive information to an unauthenticated remote attacker.

On Debian, this out-of-bounds read is not exploitable, because
smtp_connection_had[-1] is always 0 and line 5305 sends smtp_names[0]
("NONE") to the client. However, the memory layout of the Exim binary
may be more favorable to attackers on other operating systems.

commit 18481de384caecff421f23f715be916403f5d0ee

------------------------------------------------------------------------

and was independently discovered by Exim's developers in July 2020:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
commit afaf5a50b05810d75c1f7ae9d1cd83697815a997

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28021: New-line injection into spool header file (remote)
========================================================================

An authenticated SMTP client can add an AUTH= parameter to its MAIL FROM
command. This AUTH= parameter is decoded by auth_xtextdecode():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
4697           case ENV_MAIL_OPT_AUTH:
....
4703               if (auth_xtextdecode(value, &authenticated_sender) < 0)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

and the resulting authenticated_sender is written to the spool header
file without encoding or escaping:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
212 if (authenticated_sender)
213   fprintf(fp, "-auth_sender %s\n", authenticated_sender);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, authenticated_sender can contain arbitrary characters,
because auth_xtextdecode() translates hexadecimal +XY sequences into
equivalent characters (for example, +0A into '\n'): an authenticated
remote attacker can inject new lines into the spool header file and
execute arbitrary commands, as root.

This vulnerability is particularly problematic for Internet service
providers and mail providers that deploy Exim and offer mail accounts
but not shell accounts. It is also problematic when combined with an
authentication bypass such as CVE-2020-12783, discovered by Orange Tsai
in May 2020 (<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2571>).

Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our exploit for CVE-2020-28021 is essentially the same as our exploit
for CVE-2020-28015. The main difference is that Exim's ACLs limit the
length of our header lines to 998 characters. However, this limit can be
easily bypassed, by splitting long header lines into 990-character lines
separated by "\n " (i.e., continuation lines).

We can also transform CVE-2020-28021 into an information disclosure:

- First, we inject an arbitrary recipient line into the spool header
  file: an arbitrary recipient address (for example, attacker@...e.com)
  and an errors_to string that is read out-of-bounds (the same technique
  as for CVE-2020-28015).

- Next, we wait for Exim to connect to our own mail server, fake.com's
  MX (we use <https://github.com/iphelix/dnschef> to set up a quick and
  easy DNS server).

- Last, we retrieve the out-of-bounds errors_to string from Exim's MAIL
  FROM command (which, in this example, contains a fragment of
  /etc/passwd):

CVE-2020-28022: Heap out-of-bounds read and write in extract_option()
========================================================================

The name=value parameters such as AUTH= are extracted from MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands by extract_option():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1994 static BOOL
1995 extract_option(uschar **name, uschar **value)
1996 {
1997 uschar *n;
1998 uschar *v = smtp_cmd_data + Ustrlen(smtp_cmd_data) - 1;
....
2001 while (v > smtp_cmd_data && *v != '=' && !isspace(*v))
2002   {
....
2005   if (*v == '"') do v--; while (*v != '"' && v > smtp_cmd_data+1);
2006   v--;
2007   }
2008
2009 n = v;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, this function can decrease v (value) and hence n (name)
out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds (into the preceding smtp_cmd_buffer):

- at line 2001, v can point to smtp_cmd_data + 1;

- at line 2005, v-- decrements v to smtp_cmd_data;

- at line 2006, v-- decrements v to smtp_cmd_data - 1.

Subsequently, the code in extract_option() and smtp_setup_msg() reads
from and writes to v and n out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds.

If exploitable, this vulnerability would allow an unauthenticated remote
attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the "exim" user. So far we
were unable to exploit this vulnerability: although we are able to
decrease v and n out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds, we were unable to
decrease v or n out of the preceding smtp_cmd_buffer's bounds.
Surprisingly, however, we do use this vulnerability in our
proof-of-concept for CVE-2020-28026.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28026: Line truncation and injection in spool_read_header()
========================================================================

spool_read_header() calls fgets() to read the lines from a spool header
file into the 16KB big_buffer. The first section of spool_read_header()
enlarges big_buffer dynamically if fgets() truncates a line (if a line
is longer than 16KB):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 460   if (Ufgets(big_buffer, big_buffer_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
 ...
 462   while (  (len = Ustrlen(big_buffer)) == big_buffer_size-1
 463         && big_buffer[len-1] != '\n'
 ...
 468     buf = store_get_perm(big_buffer_size *= 2, FALSE);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the second section of spool_read_header() does not
enlarge big_buffer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 756 for (recipients_count = 0; recipients_count < rcount; recipients_count++)
 ...
 765   if (Ufgets(big_buffer, big_buffer_size, fp) == NULL) goto SPOOL_READ_ERROR;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If DSN (Delivery Status Notification) is enabled (it is disabled by
default), an attacker can send a RCPT TO command with a long ORCPT=
parameter that is written to the spool header file by
spool_write_header():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
292 for (int i = 0; i < recipients_count; i++)
293   {
294   recipient_item *r = recipients_list + i;
...
302     uschar * errors_to = r->errors_to ? r->errors_to : US"";
...
305     uschar * orcpt = r->orcpt ? r->orcpt : US"";
306
307     fprintf(fp, "%s %s %d,%d %s %d,%d#3\n", r->address, orcpt, Ustrlen(orcpt),
308       r->dsn_flags, errors_to, Ustrlen(errors_to), r->pno);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This long ORCPT= parameter truncates the recipient line (when read by
fgets() in spool_read_header()) and injects the remainder of the line as
a separate line, thereby emulating the '\n' injection of CVE-2020-28015
and CVE-2020-28021 (albeit in a weaker form).

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as root (if DSN is enabled).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proof of concept
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Intuitively, it seems impossible to generate a recipient line longer
  than 16KB (big_buffer_size), because the Exim server reads our RCPT TO
  command into a 16KB buffer (smtp_cmd_buffer) that must also contain
  (besides our long ORCPT= parameter) "RCPT TO:", "NOTIFY=DELAY", and
  the recipient address.

- We can, however, use the special recipient "postmaster", which is
  automatically qualified (by appending Exim's primary hostname) before
  it is written to the spool header file. This allows us to enlarge the
  recipient line, but is not sufficient to control the end of the
  truncated line (unless Exim's primary hostname is longer than 24
  bytes, which is very unlikely).

- But we can do better: we can use CVE-2020-28022 to read our ORCPT=
  parameter out of smtp_cmd_data's bounds (from the end of the preceding
  smtp_cmd_buffer). This allows us to further enlarge the recipient line
  (by 10 bytes, because "postmaster" is now included in our ORCPT=), but
  is not sufficient to reliably control the end of the truncated line
  (unless Exim's primary hostname is longer than 14 bytes, which is
  still very unlikely).

- But we can do much better: we do not need postmaster's automatic
  qualification anymore, because the recipient is now included in our
  ORCPT= parameter -- the longer the recipient, the better. On Debian,
  the user "systemd-timesync" exists by default, and "localhost" is one
  of Exim's local_domains: the recipient "systemd-timesync@...alhost" is
  long enough to reliably control the end of the truncated recipient
  line, and allows us to read and write out of big_buffer's bounds
  (lines 859 and 863, and beyond):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 840   else if (*p == '#')
 ...
 848     (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d", &flags);
 849
 850     if ((flags & 0x01) != 0)      /* one_time data exists */
 851       {
 852       int len;
 853       while (isdigit(*(--p)) || *p == ',' || *p == '-');
 854       (void)sscanf(CS p+1, "%d,%d", &len, &pno);
 855       *p = 0;
 856       if (len > 0)
 857         {
 858         p -= len;
 859         errors_to = string_copy_taint(p, TRUE);
 860         }
 861       }
 862
 863     *(--p) = 0;   /* Terminate address */

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28019: Failure to reset function pointer after BDAT error
========================================================================

To read SMTP commands and data from a client, Exim calls the function
pointer receive_getc, which points to either smtp_getc() (a cleartext
connection) or tls_getc() (an encrypted connection). If the client uses
the BDAT command (instead of DATA) to send a mail, then Exim saves the
current value of receive_getc to the function pointer lwr_receive_getc
and sets receive_getc to the wrapper function bdat_getc():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5242     case BDAT_CMD:
....
5271       lwr_receive_getc = receive_getc;
....
5275       receive_getc = bdat_getc;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exim normally resets receive_getc to its original value
(lwr_receive_getc) when the client ends its mail. Unfortunately, Exim
fails to reset receive_getc in some cases; for example, if the mail is
larger than message_size_limit (50MB by default). Consequently, Exim
re-enters smtp_setup_msg() while receive_getc still points to
bdat_getc(), and:

- smtp_read_command() calls receive_getc and hence bdat_getc(), which
  also calls smtp_read_command(), which is not a re-entrant function and
  may have unintended consequences;

- if the client issues another BDAT command, then receive_getc and
  lwr_receive_getc both point to bdat_getc(), which calls itself
  recursively and leads to stack exhaustion; for example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(
sleep 10;
echo 'EHLO test';
sleep 3;
echo 'MAIL FROM:<>';
sleep 3;
echo 'RCPT TO:postmaster';
sleep 3;
echo "BDAT $((52428800+100))";
perl -e 'print "A" x (52428800+1)';
sleep 3;
echo 'MAIL FROM:<>';
sleep 3;
echo 'RCPT TO:postmaster';
sleep 3;
echo 'BDAT 8388608'
) | nc -n -v 192.168.56.101 25

------------------------------------------------------------------------

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28024: Heap buffer underflow in smtp_ungetc()
========================================================================

Exim calls smtp_refill() to read input characters from an SMTP client
into the 8KB smtp_inbuffer, and calls smtp_getc() to read individual
characters from smtp_inbuffer:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 501 static BOOL
 502 smtp_refill(unsigned lim)
 503 {
 ...
 512 rc = read(fileno(smtp_in), smtp_inbuffer, MIN(IN_BUFFER_SIZE-1, lim));
 ...
 515 if (rc <= 0)
 516   {
 ...
 536   return FALSE;
 537   }
 ...
 541 smtp_inend = smtp_inbuffer + rc;
 542 smtp_inptr = smtp_inbuffer;
 543 return TRUE;
 544 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 559 int
 560 smtp_getc(unsigned lim)
 561 {
 562 if (smtp_inptr >= smtp_inend)
 563   if (!smtp_refill(lim))
 564     return EOF;
 565 return *smtp_inptr++;
 566 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exim implements an smtp_ungetc() function to push characters back into
smtp_inbuffer (characters that were read from smtp_inbuffer by
smtp_getc()):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 795 int
 796 smtp_ungetc(int ch)
 797 {
 798 *--smtp_inptr = ch;
 799 return ch;
 800 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, Exim also calls smtp_ungetc() to push back "characters"
that were not actually read from smtp_inbuffer: EOF (-1), and if BDAT is
used, EOD and ERR (-2 and -3). For example, in receive_msg():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
1945   if (ch == '\r')
1946     {
1947     ch = (receive_getc)(GETC_BUFFER_UNLIMITED);
1948     if (ch == '\n')
1949       {
....
1952       }
....
1957     ch = (receive_ungetc)(ch);
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 1947, receive_getc (smtp_getc()) can return EOF;

- at line 1957, this EOF is passed to receive_ungetc (smtp_ungetc());

- at line 798 (in smtp_ungetc()), if smtp_inptr is exactly equal to
  smtp_inbuffer, then it is decremented to smtp_inbuffer - 1, and EOF is
  written out of smtp_inbuffer's bounds.

To return EOF in receive_msg() while smtp_inptr is equal to
smtp_inbuffer, we must initiate a TLS-encrypted connection:

- either through TLS-on-connect (usually on port 465), which does not
  use smtp_inptr nor smtp_inbuffer;

- or through STARTTLS, which resets smtp_inptr to smtp_inbuffer in the
  following code (if X_PIPE_CONNECT is enabled, the default since Exim
  4.94):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
5484       if (receive_smtp_buffered())
5485         {
5486         DEBUG(D_any)
5487           debug_printf("Non-empty input buffer after STARTTLS; naive attack?\n");
5488         if (tls_in.active.sock < 0)
5489           smtp_inend = smtp_inptr = smtp_inbuffer;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In both cases:

- first, we initiate a TLS-encrypted connection, which sets receive_getc
  and receive_ungetc to tls_getc() and tls_ungetc() (while smtp_inptr is
  equal to smtp_inbuffer);

- second, we start a mail (MAIL FROM, RCPT TO, and DATA commands) and
  enter receive_msg();

- third, we send a bare '\r' character and reach line 1945;

- next, we terminate the TLS connection, which resets receive_getc and
  receive_ungetc to smtp_getc() and smtp_ungetc() (while smtp_inptr is
  still equal to smtp_inbuffer);

- last, we close the underlying TCP connection, which returns EOF at
  line 1947 and writes EOF out of smtp_inbuffer's bounds at line 1957
  (line 798 in smtp_ungetc()).

We have not tried to exploit this vulnerability; if exploitable, it
would allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary
commands as the "exim" user (if TLS and either TLS-on-connect or
X_PIPE_CONNECT are enabled).

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28018: Use-after-free in tls-openssl.c
========================================================================

If Exim is built with OpenSSL, and if STARTTLS is enabled, and if
PIPELINING is enabled (the default), and if X_PIPE_CONNECT is disabled
(the default before Exim 4.94), then tls_write() in tls-openssl.c is
vulnerable to a use-after-free.

If PIPELINING is used, Exim buffers the SMTP responses to MAIL FROM and
RCPT TO commands (in tls-openssl.c):

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2909 int
2910 tls_write(void * ct_ctx, const uschar *buff, size_t len, BOOL more)
2911 {
....
2915 static gstring * server_corked = NULL;
2916 gstring ** corkedp = ct_ctx
2917   ? &((exim_openssl_client_tls_ctx *)ct_ctx)->corked : &server_corked;
2918 gstring * corked = *corkedp;
....
2933 if (!ct_ctx && (more || corked))
2934   {
....
2940   corked = string_catn(corked, buff, len);
....
2946   if (more)
2947     {
2948     *corkedp = corked;
2949     return len;
2950     }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 2910, ct_ctx is NULL, buff contains the SMTP response, and
  more is true;

- at line 2940, a struct gstring (a "growable string", mentioned in
  CVE-2020-28009) and its string buffer are allocated in POOL_MAIN
  memory:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 29 typedef struct gstring {
 30   int   size;           /* Current capacity of string memory */
 31   int   ptr;            /* Offset at which to append further chars */
 32   uschar * s;           /* The string memory */
 33 } gstring;
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- at line 2948, a pointer to the struct gstring is saved to a local
  static variable, server_corked.

Unfortunately, if smtp_reset() is called (in smtp_setup_msg()), then
store_reset() is called and frees all allocated POOL_MAIN memory, but
server_corked is not reset to NULL: if tls_write() is called again, the
struct gstring and its string buffer are used-after-free.

Side note: another use-after-free, CVE-2017-16943, was discovered by Meh
Chang in November 2017 (<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2199>).

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exploitation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To reliably control this vulnerability, we must prevent Exim from
calling tls_write() between our call to smtp_reset() and the actual
use-after-free:

- first, we send EHLO and STARTTLS (to initiate a TLS connection);

- second, we send EHLO and "MAIL FROM:<>\nNO" (to pipeline the first
  half of a NOOP command, and to buffer the response to our MAIL FROM
  command in tls_write());

- third, we terminate the TLS connection (and fall back to cleartext)
  and send "OP\n" (the second half of our pipelined NOOP command);

- next, we send EHLO (to force a call to smtp_reset()) and STARTTLS (to
  re-initiate a TLS connection);

- last, server_corked is used-after-free (in tls_write()) in response to
  any SMTP command that we send.

This use-after-free of a struct gstring (server_corked) and its string
buffer (server_corked->s) is the most powerful vulnerability in this
advisory:

1/ We overwrite the string buffer (which is sent to us by tls_write())
and transform this use-after-free into an information leak (we leak
pointers to the heap).

2/ We overwrite the struct gstring (with an arbitrary string pointer and
size) and transform the use-after-free into a read-what-where primitive:
we read the heap until we locate Exim's configuration.

3/ We overwrite the struct gstring (with an arbitrary string pointer)
and transform the use-after-free into a write-what-where primitive: we
overwrite Exim's configuration with an arbitrary "${run{command}}" that
is executed by expand_string() as the "exim" user (Digression 2).

We use a few noteworthy tricks in our exploit:

1/ Information leak: To overwrite the string buffer without overwriting
the struct gstring itself, we send several pipelined RCPT TO commands to
re-allocate the string buffer (far away from the struct gstring), and
overwrite it with header_line structures that contain pointers to the
heap.

2/ Read-what-where: We overwrite the struct gstring with arbitrary
binary data through the name=value parameter of a MAIL FROM command:

- we overwrite the s member with a pointer to the memory that we want to
  read (a pointer to the heap);

- we overwrite the ptr member with the number of bytes that we want to
  read;

- we overwrite the size member with the same number as ptr to prevent
  string_catn() from writing to the memory that we want to read (at line
  2940 in tls_write()).

3/ Write-what-where: We overwrite the struct gstring with arbitrary
binary data through the name=value parameter of a MAIL FROM command:

- we overwrite the s member with a pointer to the memory that we want to
  overwrite (a pointer to Exim's configuration);

- we overwrite the ptr member with 0 and the size member with a large
  arbitrary number;

- finally, we send a MAIL FROM command whose response overwrites Exim's
  configuration with our arbitrary "${run{...}}" (which is eventually
  executed by expand_string()).

Note: Debian's Exim packages are built with GnuTLS, not OpenSSL; to
rebuild them with OpenSSL, we followed the detailed instructions at
<https://gist.github.com/ryancdotorg/11025731>.

========================================================================
CVE-2020-28025: Heap out-of-bounds read in pdkim_finish_bodyhash()
========================================================================

By default since Exim 4.70, receive_msg() calls
dkim_exim_verify_finish() to verify DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
signatures, which calls pdkim_feed_finish(), which calls
pdkim_finish_bodyhash():

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 788 static void
 789 pdkim_finish_bodyhash(pdkim_ctx * ctx)
 790 {
 ...
 799 for (pdkim_signature * sig = ctx->sig; sig; sig = sig->next)
 800   {
 ...
 825     if (  sig->bodyhash.data
 826        && memcmp(b->bh.data, sig->bodyhash.data, b->bh.len) == 0)
 827       {
 ...
 829       }
 830     else

 840       }
 841   }
 842 }
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, at line 826, sig->bodyhash.data is attacker-controlled
(through a "DKIM-Signature:" mail header) and memcmp() is called without
checking first that sig->bodyhash.len is equal to b->bh.len: memcmp()
can read sig->bodyhash.data out-of-bounds.

If the acl_smtp_dkim is set (it is unset by default), an unauthenticated
remote attacker may transform this vulnerability into an information
disclosure; we have not fully explored this possibility.

Timeline (abridged)
========================================================================

2020-10-20: We (qsa@...lys) informed Exim (security@...m) that we
audited central parts of the code, discovered multiple vulnerabilities,
and are working on an advisory. Exim immediately acknowledged our mail.

2020-10-28: We sent the first draft of our advisory to Exim. They
immediately acknowledged our mail, and started to work on patches.

2020-10-29: We sent a list of 10 secondary issues to Exim (to the best
of our knowledge, these issues are not CVE-worthy).

2020-10-30: We requested 20 CVEs from Mitre. They were assigned on the
same day, and we immediately transmitted them to Exim.

2020-11-13: Exim gave us read access to their private Git repository. We
started reviewing their first set of patches (which tackled 7 CVEs).

2020-11-17 and 2020-11-18: We sent a two-part patch review to Exim
(several patches were incomplete).

2020-12-02: A second set of patches (which tackled 7 secondary issues)
appeared in Exim's private Git repository. We started reviewing it.

2020-12-09: We sent our second patch review to Exim.

2021-01-28: We mailed Exim and offered to work on the incomplete and
missing patches (the last commit in Exim's private Git repository dated
from 2020-12-02).

2021-02-05: Exim acknowledged our mail. We started to write a minimal
but complete set of patches (on top of exim-4.94+fixes).

2021-02-15: While working on a patch for CVE-2020-28014, we discovered
CVE-2021-27216. We requested a CVE from Mitre, and immediately sent a
heads-up to Exim.

2021-02-24: We completed our minimal set of patches and sent it to Exim.

2021-04-17: Exim proposed 2021-05-04 for the Coordinated Release Date.

2021-04-19: We accepted the proposed Coordinated Release Date.

2021-04-21: Exim publicly announced the impending security release.

2021-04-27: Exim provided packagers and maintainers (including
distros@...nwall) with access to their security Git repository.

2021-04-28: We sent a draft of our advisory and our minimal set of
patches to distros@...nwall.

2021-05-04: Coordinated Release Date (13:30 UTC).

=head1 Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at L<General Exim Information>.

=head2 General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximDevelopment> - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

=head2 Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a  git (L<https://git-scm.com/>)
repository. The master repository is at L<git://git.exim.org/exim.git>
with a web interface giving change and source visibility at
L<https://git.exim.org/exim.git>

There is a secondary repository on github at
L<https://github.com/Exim/exim> managed by the Exim Organisation
- however this may currently fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

=head2 Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at L<https://bugs.exim.org/>
- please do not use github issue tracking.

=head2 Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
- see L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html>

=head2 Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximRelease>.

=head2 General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
L<https://www.exim.org/>.

You can find Download locations L<https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html>,
Mailing list info L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html> and Full
Documentation L<https://www.exim.org/docs.html> on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list L<https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/>
for further information.

## Name

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```

You have two entries for Exim CVE-2019-10149, which is wrong.  Also,
some of the dates are wrong (e.g., the date of Exim's pre-announcement
to oss-security is irrelevant).  Please combine this into one entry and
update the dates.  I guess the range of dates should be from 2019-05-28
(initial notification to distros) to 2019-06-05 (full publication).

Correcting this will probably affect the averages.

Thanks,

Alexander

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

Package        : exim4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-10149

The Qualys Research Labs reported a flaw in Exim, a mail transport
agent. Improper validation of the recipient address in the
deliver_message() function may result in the execution of arbitrary
commands.

For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.89-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.

=head1 Exim Development Repository

This is the Exim (Mail Transport Agent) Development Repository. Please
read the following information if you wish to use or contribute to the
Exim development process - this is to prevent your or our time being
unnecessarily wasted.

If you just want to use, build or get information on Exim then have a
look at the pointers further down this file at L<General Exim Information>.

=head2 General Development Information

The general Exim development process and resources are documented in
the wiki page at L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximDevelopment> - although
the wiki is likely to be moved and rehashed in the near future.

The sections below this duplicate much of the information form the
wiki document.

=head2 Development Repositories

Exim development is kept within a  git (L<https://git-scm.com/>)
repository. The master repository is at L<git://git.exim.org/exim.git>
with a web interface giving change and source visibility at
L<https://git.exim.org/exim.git>

There is a secondary repository on github at
L<https://github.com/Exim/exim> managed by the Exim Organisation
- however this may currently fall out of synchronisation with the
main one.

=head2 Bug Tracking

Currently this is all done using Bugzilla at L<https://bugs.exim.org/>
- please do not use github issue tracking.

=head2 Mailing List

Development issues are normally discussed on the exim-dev mailing list
- see L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html>

=head2 Exim Release Process

Some documentation on the release process can be found at
L<http://wiki.exim.org/EximRelease>.

=head2 General Exim Information

The best place to get general information is on the website at
L<https://www.exim.org/>.

You can find Download locations L<https://www.exim.org/mirrors.html>,
Mailing list info L<https://www.exim.org/maillist.html> and Full
Documentation L<https://www.exim.org/docs.html> on that website.

If you are using a Linux or other freely available Unix like operating
system it is very likely that your system will have Exim packaged for
it already. In this case it is probably prudent to use these packages
unless you have specialised requirements.

In any case you can always ask on the
Exim Users mailing list L<https://lists.exim.org/mailman3/postorius/lists/exim-users.lists.exim.org/>
for further information.

As per the distros list policy:

Below is an abridged version of our advisory (with all the vulnerability
details, but without exploitation details); we will publish the complete
version in 24 hours, or as soon as third-party exploits are published,
whichever happens first.

We believe that it makes no sense to delay this any longer than that:
this vulnerability is trivially exploitable in the local and non-default
cases (attackers will have working exploits before that, public or not);
and in the default case, a remote attack takes a long time to succeed
(to the best of our knowledge).

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

During a code review of the latest changes in the Exim mail server
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim>), we discovered an RCE vulnerability
in versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). In this particular case, RCE means
Remote *Command* Execution, not Remote Code Execution: an attacker can
execute arbitrary commands with execv(), as root; no memory corruption
or ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) is involved.

This vulnerability is exploitable instantly by a local attacker (and by
a remote attacker in certain non-default configurations). To remotely
exploit this vulnerability in the default configuration, an attacker
must keep a connection to the vulnerable server open for 7 days (by
transmitting one byte every few minutes). However, because of the
extreme complexity of Exim's code, we cannot guarantee that this
exploitation method is unique; faster methods may exist.

Exim is vulnerable by default since version 4.87 (released on April 6,
2016), when #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT became #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT; and
older versions may also be vulnerable if EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT was enabled
manually. Surprisingly, this vulnerability was fixed in version 4.92
(released on February 10, 2019):

<https://github.com/Exim/exim/commit/7ea1237c783e380d7bdb86c90b13d8203c7ecf26>
<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310>

but was not identified as a security vulnerability, and most operating
systems are therefore affected. For example, we exploit an up-to-date
Debian distribution (9.9) in this advisory.

========================================================================
Local exploitation
========================================================================

The vulnerable code is located in deliver_message():

6122 #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT
6123       if (process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT)
6124         {
6125         uschar * save_local =  deliver_localpart;
6126         const uschar * save_domain = deliver_domain;
6127
6128         deliver_localpart = expand_string(
6129                       string_sprintf("${local_part:%s}", new->address));
6130         deliver_domain =    expand_string(
6131                       string_sprintf("${domain:%s}", new->address));
6132
6133         (void) event_raise(event_action,
6134                       US"msg:fail:internal", new->message);
6135
6136         deliver_localpart = save_local;
6137         deliver_domain =    save_domain;
6138         }
6139 #endif

Because expand_string() recognizes the "${run{<command> <args>}}"
expansion item, and because new->address is the recipient of the mail
that is being delivered, a local attacker can simply send a mail to
"${run{...}}@...alhost" (where "localhost" is one of Exim's
local_domains) and execute arbitrary commands, as root
(deliver_drop_privilege is false, by default):

[...]

========================================================================
Remote exploitation
========================================================================

Our local-exploitation method does not work remotely, because the
"verify = recipient" ACL (Access-Control List) in Exim's default
configuration requires the local part of the recipient's address (the
part that precedes the @ sign) to be the name of a local user:

[...]

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-default configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We eventually devised an elaborate method for exploiting Exim remotely
in its default configuration, but we first identified various
non-default configurations that are easy to exploit remotely:

- If the "verify = recipient" ACL was removed manually by an
  administrator (maybe to prevent username enumeration via RCPT TO),
  then our local-exploitation method also works remotely.

- If Exim was configured to recognize tags in the local part of the
  recipient's address (via "local_part_suffix = +* : -*" for example),
  then a remote attacker can simply reuse our local-exploitation method
  with an RCPT TO "balrog+${run{...}}@...alhost" (where "balrog" is the
  name of a local user).

- If Exim was configured to relay mail to a remote domain, as a
  secondary MX (Mail eXchange), then a remote attacker can simply reuse
  our local-exploitation method with an RCPT TO "${run{...}}@...zad.dum"
  (where "khazad.dum" is one of Exim's relay_to_domains). Indeed, the
  "verify = recipient" ACL can only check the domain part of a remote
  address (the part that follows the @ sign), not the local part.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Indeed, the   "verify = recipient" ACL can only check the domain part of a remote   address (the part that follows the @ sign), not the local part.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Default configuration ------------------------------------------------------------------------  First, we solve the "verify = recipient" ACL problem with a "bounce" message: if we send a mail that cannot be delivered, Exim automatically sends a delivery-failure message (a "bounce") to the original sender. In other words, the sender of our original mail (our MAIL FROM) becomes the recipient of the bounce (its RCPT TO) and can therefore execute commands with "${run{...}}". Indeed, the "verify = sender" ACL in Exim's default configuration can only check the domain part of our original sender address, not its local part (because it is a remote address).  Next, the bounce must reach the vulnerable code and pass the process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT test, but we cannot reuse our received_headers_max trick because we do not control the bounce's headers. Our solution to this second problem is not optimal: if the bounce itself cannot be delivered after 7 days (the default timeout_frozen_after), then Exim sets process_recipients to RECIP_FAIL_TIMEOUT and executes the vulnerable code.  Last, we must solve a seemingly intractable problem: after 2 days (the default ignore_bounce_errors_after) the bounce is discarded unless it is deferred (by a temporary delivery failure), and after 4 days the default retry rule ("F,2h,15m; G,16h,1h,1.5; F,4d,6h") turns deferred addresses into failed addresses, and hence discards the bounce before the 7 days of timeout_frozen_after. Below is our solution to this third problem, and to the remote-exploitation problem in general (but simpler and faster solutions may exist):  1/ We connect to the vulnerable Exim server and send a mail that cannot be delivered (because we send more than received_headers_max "Received:" headers). The recipient address (RCPT TO) of our mail is "postmaster", and its sender address (MAIL FROM) is "${run{...}}@khazad.dum" (where "khazad.dum" is a domain that is under our control).  2/ Because our mail cannot be delivered, Exim connects to khazad.dum's MX (where we listen for and accept this connection) and starts sending a bounce message to "${run{...}}@khazad.dum".  3/ We keep this connection open for 7 days (the default timeout_frozen_after), by sending a byte to Exim every 4 minutes.

========================================================================
Summary
========================================================================

During a code review of the latest changes in the Exim mail server
(<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exim>), we discovered an RCE vulnerability
in versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). In this particular case, RCE means
Remote *Command* Execution, not Remote Code Execution: an attacker can
execute arbitrary commands with execv(), as root; no memory corruption
or ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) is involved.

This vulnerability is exploitable instantly by a local attacker (and by
a remote attacker in certain non-default configurations). To remotely
exploit this vulnerability in the default configuration, an attacker
must keep a connection to the vulnerable server open for 7 days (by
transmitting one byte every few minutes). However, because of the
extreme complexity of Exim's code, we cannot guarantee that this
exploitation method is unique; faster methods may exist.

Exim is vulnerable by default since version 4.87 (released on April 6,
2016), when #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT became #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT; and
older versions may also be vulnerable if EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT was enabled
manually. Surprisingly, this vulnerability was fixed in version 4.92
(released on February 10, 2019):

<https://github.com/Exim/exim/commit/7ea1237c783e380d7bdb86c90b13d8203c7ecf26>
<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310>

but was not identified as a security vulnerability, and most operating
systems are therefore affected. For example, we exploit an up-to-date
Debian distribution (9.9) in this advisory.

========================================================================
Local exploitation
========================================================================

The vulnerable code is located in deliver_message():

6122 #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT
6123       if (process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT)
6124         {
6125         uschar * save_local =  deliver_localpart;
6126         const uschar * save_domain = deliver_domain;
6127
6128         deliver_localpart = expand_string(
6129                       string_sprintf("${local_part:%s}", new->address));
6130         deliver_domain =    expand_string(
6131                       string_sprintf("${domain:%s}", new->address));
6132
6133         (void) event_raise(event_action,
6134                       US"msg:fail:internal", new->message);
6135
6136         deliver_localpart = save_local;
6137         deliver_domain =    save_domain;
6138         }
6139 #endif

Because expand_string() recognizes the "${run{<command> <args>}}"
expansion item, and because new->address is the recipient of the mail
that is being delivered, a local attacker can simply send a mail to
"${run{...}}@...alhost" (where "localhost" is one of Exim's
local_domains) and execute arbitrary commands, as root
(deliver_drop_privilege is false, by default):

john@...ian:~$ cat /tmp/id

uid=0(root) gid=111(Debian-exim) groups=111(Debian-exim)
uid=0(root) gid=111(Debian-exim) groups=111(Debian-exim)

In this example:

- we send more than received_headers_max (30, by default) "Received:"
  headers to the mail server, to set process_recipients to
  RECIP_FAIL_LOOP and hence execute the vulnerable code;

- we escape invalid characters in the recipient's address with
  backslashes, which are conveniently interpreted by expand_string() (in
  expand_string_internal() and transport_set_up_command()).

========================================================================
Remote exploitation
========================================================================

Our local-exploitation method does not work remotely, because the
"verify = recipient" ACL (Access-Control List) in Exim's default
configuration requires the local part of the recipient's address (the
part that precedes the @ sign) to be the name of a local user:

john@...ian:~$ nc 192.168.56.101 25
220 debian ESMTP Exim 4.89 Thu, 23 May 2019 10:06:37 -0400
HELO localhost
250 debian Hello localhost [192.168.56.101]
MAIL FROM:<>
250 OK
RCPT TO:<${run{\x2Fbin\x2Fsh\t-c\t\x22id\x3E\x3E\x2Ftmp\x2Fid\x22}}@...alhost>
550 Unrouteable address

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-default configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We eventually devised an elaborate method for exploiting Exim remotely
in its default configuration, but we first identified various
non-default configurations that are easy to exploit remotely:

- If the "verify = recipient" ACL was removed manually by an
  administrator (maybe to prevent username enumeration via RCPT TO),
  then our local-exploitation method also works remotely.

- If Exim was configured to recognize tags in the local part of the
  recipient's address (via "local_part_suffix = +* : -*" for example),
  then a remote attacker can simply reuse our local-exploitation method
  with an RCPT TO "balrog+${run{...}}@...alhost" (where "balrog" is the
  name of a local user).

- If Exim was configured to relay mail to a remote domain, as a
  secondary MX (Mail eXchange), then a remote attacker can simply reuse
  our local-exploitation method with an RCPT TO "${run{...}}@...zad.dum"
  (where "khazad.dum" is one of Exim's relay_to_domains). Indeed, the
  "verify = recipient" ACL can only check the domain part of a remote
  address (the part that follows the @ sign), not the local part.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we solve the "verify = recipient" ACL problem with a "bounce"
message: if we send a mail that cannot be delivered, Exim automatically
sends a delivery-failure message (a "bounce") to the original sender. In
other words, the sender of our original mail (our MAIL FROM) becomes the
recipient of the bounce (its RCPT TO) and can therefore execute commands
with "${run{...}}". Indeed, the "verify = sender" ACL in Exim's default
configuration can only check the domain part of our original sender
address, not its local part (because it is a remote address).

Next, the bounce must reach the vulnerable code and pass the
process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT test, but we cannot reuse our
received_headers_max trick because we do not control the bounce's
headers. Our solution to this second problem is not optimal: if the
bounce itself cannot be delivered after 7 days (the default
timeout_frozen_after), then Exim sets process_recipients to
RECIP_FAIL_TIMEOUT and executes the vulnerable code.

Last, we must solve a seemingly intractable problem: after 2 days (the
default ignore_bounce_errors_after) the bounce is discarded unless it is
deferred (by a temporary delivery failure), and after 4 days the default
retry rule ("F,2h,15m; G,16h,1h,1.5; F,4d,6h") turns deferred addresses
into failed addresses, and hence discards the bounce before the 7 days
of timeout_frozen_after. Below is our solution to this third problem,
and to the remote-exploitation problem in general (but simpler and
faster solutions may exist):

1/ We connect to the vulnerable Exim server and send a mail that cannot
be delivered (because we send more than received_headers_max "Received:"
headers). The recipient address (RCPT TO) of our mail is "postmaster",
and its sender address (MAIL FROM) is "${run{...}}@...zad.dum" (where
"khazad.dum" is a domain that is under our control).

2/ Because our mail cannot be delivered, Exim connects to khazad.dum's
MX (where we listen for and accept this connection) and starts sending a
bounce message to "${run{...}}@...zad.dum".

3/ We keep this connection open for 7 days (the default
timeout_frozen_after), by sending a byte to Exim every 4 minutes. This
works because Exim reads the response to its SMTP commands (Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol) into a 4096-byte buffer (DELIVER_BUFFER_SIZE) with a
5-minute timeout (the default command_timeout) that is reset every time
a byte is read.

4/ After 7 days, we complete our lengthy SMTP response with a permanent
delivery failure (for example, "550 Unrouteable address") which freezes
the bounce in post_process_one(). This function should actually discard
the bounce instead of freezing it (which would prevent us from reaching
the vulnerable code) because it is older than 2 days (the default
ignore_bounce_errors_after):

1613   /* If this is a delivery error, or a message for which no replies are
1614   wanted, and the message's age is greater than ignore_bounce_errors_after,
1615   force the af_ignore_error flag. This will cause the address to be discarded
1616   later (with a log entry). */
1617
1618   if (!*sender_address && message_age >= ignore_bounce_errors_after)
1619     setflag(addr, af_ignore_error);

However, in this particular case, message_age is not the bounce's real
age (over 7 days) but its age when it was first loaded from Exim's spool
(when it was just a few seconds or minutes old).

5/ Finally, Exim's next queue run (every 30 minutes by default, on
Debian) loads the frozen bounce from the spool, sets process_recipients
to RECIP_FAIL_TIMEOUT (this time, message_age is the bounce's real age,
over 7 days), and executes the vulnerable code and our commands (our
original sender address, "${run{...}}@...zad.dum", is the bounce's
recipient address, which is interpreted by expand_string()).

Note: to quickly test this remote-exploitation method, the days in
Exim's default timeout_frozen_after and ignore_bounce_errors_after can
be replaced by hours, and the default retry rule by "F,4h,6m".

2016), when #ifdef EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT became #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT; and
older versions may also be vulnerable if EXPERIMENTAL_EVENT was enabled
manually. Surprisingly, this vulnerability was fixed in version 4.92
(released on February 10, 2019):

<https://github.com/Exim/exim/commit/7ea1237c783e380d7bdb86c90b13d8203c7ecf26>
<https://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=2310>

but was not identified as a security vulnerability, and most operating
systems are therefore affected. For example, we exploit an up-to-date
Debian distribution (9.9) in this advisory.

========================================================================
Local exploitation
========================================================================

The vulnerable code is located in deliver_message():

6122 #ifndef DISABLE_EVENT
6123       if (process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT)
6124         {
6125         uschar * save_local =  deliver_localpart;
6126         const uschar * save_domain = deliver_domain;
6127
6128         deliver_localpart = expand_string(
6129                       string_sprintf("${local_part:%s}", new->address));
6130         deliver_domain =    expand_string(
6131                       string_sprintf("${domain:%s}", new->address));
6132
6133         (void) event_raise(event_action,
6134                       US"msg:fail:internal", new->message);
6135
6136         deliver_localpart = save_local;
6137         deliver_domain =    save_domain;
6138         }
6139 #endif

Because expand_string() recognizes the "${run{<command> <args>}}"
expansion item, and because new->address is the recipient of the mail
that is being delivered, a local attacker can simply send a mail to
"${run{...}}@localhost" (where "localhost" is one of Exim's
local_domains) and execute arbitrary commands, as root
(deliver_drop_privilege is false, by default):

uid=0(root) gid=111(Debian-exim) groups=111(Debian-exim)

In this example:

- we send more than received_headers_max (30, by default) "Received:"
  headers to the mail server, to set process_recipients to
  RECIP_FAIL_LOOP and hence execute the vulnerable code;

- we escape invalid characters in the recipient's address with
  backslashes, which are conveniently interpreted by expand_string() (in
  expand_string_internal() and transport_set_up_command()).

========================================================================
Remote exploitation
========================================================================

Our local-exploitation method does not work remotely, because the
"verify = recipient" ACL (Access-Control List) in Exim's default
configuration requires the local part of the recipient's address (the
part that precedes the @ sign) to be the name of a local user:

john@debian:~$ nc 192.168.56.101 25
220 debian ESMTP Exim 4.89 Thu, 23 May 2019 10:06:37 -0400
HELO localhost
250 debian Hello localhost [192.168.56.101]
MAIL FROM:<>
250 OK
RCPT TO:<${run{\x2Fbin\x2Fsh\t-c\t\x22id\x3E\x3E\x2Ftmp\x2Fid\x22}}@localhost>
550 Unrouteable address

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-default configurations
------------------------------------------------------------------------

We eventually devised an elaborate method for exploiting Exim remotely
in its default configuration, but we first identified various
non-default configurations that are easy to exploit remotely:

- If the "verify = recipient" ACL was removed manually by an
  administrator (maybe to prevent username enumeration via RCPT TO),
  then our local-exploitation method also works remotely.

- If Exim was configured to recognize tags in the local part of the
  recipient's address (via "local_part_suffix = +* : -*" for example),
  then a remote attacker can simply reuse our local-exploitation method
  with an RCPT TO "balrog+${run{...}}@localhost" (where "balrog" is the
  name of a local user).

- If Exim was configured to relay mail to a remote domain, as a
  secondary MX (Mail eXchange), then a remote attacker can simply reuse
  our local-exploitation method with an RCPT TO "${run{...}}@khazad.dum"
  (where "khazad.dum" is one of Exim's relay_to_domains). Indeed, the
  "verify = recipient" ACL can only check the domain part of a remote
  address (the part that follows the @ sign), not the local part.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Default configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------

First, we solve the "verify = recipient" ACL problem with a "bounce"
message: if we send a mail that cannot be delivered, Exim automatically
sends a delivery-failure message (a "bounce") to the original sender. In
other words, the sender of our original mail (our MAIL FROM) becomes the
recipient of the bounce (its RCPT TO) and can therefore execute commands
with "${run{...}}". Indeed, the "verify = sender" ACL in Exim's default
configuration can only check the domain part of our original sender
address, not its local part (because it is a remote address).

Next, the bounce must reach the vulnerable code and pass the
process_recipients != RECIP_ACCEPT test, but we cannot reuse our
received_headers_max trick because we do not control the bounce's
headers. Our solution to this second problem is not optimal: if the
bounce itself cannot be delivered after 7 days (the default
timeout_frozen_after), then Exim sets process_recipients to
RECIP_FAIL_TIMEOUT and executes the vulnerable code.

Last, we must solve a seemingly intractable problem: after 2 days (the
default ignore_bounce_errors_after) the bounce is discarded unless it is
deferred (by a temporary delivery failure), and after 4 days the default
retry rule ("F,2h,15m; G,16h,1h,1.5; F,4d,6h") turns deferred addresses
into failed addresses, and hence discards the bounce before the 7 days
of timeout_frozen_after. Below is our solution to this third problem,
and to the remote-exploitation problem in general (but simpler and
faster solutions may exist):

1/ We connect to the vulnerable Exim server and send a mail that cannot
be delivered (because we send more than received_headers_max "Received:"
headers). The recipient address (RCPT TO) of our mail is "postmaster",
and its sender address (MAIL FROM) is "${run{...}}@khazad.dum" (where
"khazad.dum" is a domain that is under our control).

2/ Because our mail cannot be delivered, Exim connects to khazad.dum's
MX (where we listen for and accept this connection) and starts sending a
bounce message to "${run{...}}@khazad.dum".

3/ We keep this connection open for 7 days (the default
timeout_frozen_after), by sending a byte to Exim every 4 minutes. This
works because Exim reads the response to its SMTP commands (Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol) into a 4096-byte buffer (DELIVER_BUFFER_SIZE) with a
5-minute timeout (the default command_timeout) that is reset every time
a byte is read.

4/ After 7 days, we complete our lengthy SMTP response with a permanent
delivery failure (for example, "550 Unrouteable address") which freezes
the bounce in post_process_one(). This function should actually discard
the bounce instead of freezing it (which would prevent us from reaching
the vulnerable code) because it is older than 2 days (the default
ignore_bounce_errors_after):

1613   /* If this is a delivery error, or a message for which no replies are
1614   wanted, and the message's age is greater than ignore_bounce_errors_after,
1615   force the af_ignore_error flag. This will cause the address to be discarded
1616   later (with a log entry). */
1617
1618   if (!*sender_address && message_age >= ignore_bounce_errors_after)
1619     setflag(addr, af_ignore_error);

However, in this particular case, message_age is not the bounce's real
age (over 7 days) but its age when it was first loaded from Exim's spool
(when it was just a few seconds or minutes old).

5/ Finally, Exim's next queue run (every 30 minutes by default, on
Debian) loads the frozen bounce from the spool, sets process_recipients
to RECIP_FAIL_TIMEOUT (this time, message_age is the bounce's real age,
over 7 days), and executes the vulnerable code and our commands (our
original sender address, "${run{...}}@khazad.dum", is the bounce's
recipient address, which is interpreted by expand_string()).

Note: to quickly test this remote-exploitation method, the days in
Exim's default timeout_frozen_after and ignore_bounce_errors_after can
be replaced by hours, and the default retry rule by "F,4h,6m".

Subject: CVE-2019-10149: Exim 4.87 to 4.91: possible remote exploit

CVE-2019-10149 Exim 4.87 to 4.91
================================

We received a report of a possible remote exploit.  Currently there is no
evidenice of an active use of this exploit.

A patch exists already, is being tested, and backported to all
versions we released since (and including) 4.87.

The severity depends on your configuration.  It depends on how close to
the standard configuration your Exim runtime configuration is. The
closer the better.

Exim 4.92 is not vulnerable.

Next steps:

* t0:    Distros will get access to our non-public security Git repo
         (access is granted based on the SSH keys that are known to us)

* t0+7d: Coordinated Release Date: Distros should push the patched
         version to their repos. The Exim maintainers will publish
         the fixed source to the official and public Git repo.

t0    is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC
t0+7d is expected to be 2019-06-04, 10:00 UTC

arbitrary commands.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-mta/exim** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **4.92** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **4.92** |

### Background

Exim is a message transfer agent (MTA) designed to be a a highly
configurable, drop-in replacement for sendmail.

### Description

A vulnerability was discovered in how Exim validates recipient addresses
in the deliver\_message() function.

### Impact

A remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands by sending an email
with a specially crafted recipient address to the affected system.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Exim users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-mta/exim-4.92"

```

Thanks for the feedback, I was a bit unsure how to handle this given two

Indeed, moving this one into one entry and including full disclosure as

Subject: Re: CVE-2019-10149: Exim 4.87 to 4.91: possible
 remote exploit

The fix for CVE-2019-10149 is public now.

    <https://git.exim.org/exim.git>
    Branch exim-4_91+fixes.

Thank you to
    - Qualys for reporting it.
    - Jeremy for fixing it.
    - you for using Exim.

Sorry for confusion about the public release. We were forced to react,
as details leaked.

The patch should apply cleanly to all affected versions (4.87->4.91). We
do not do a security release, as the official Exim version is at 4.92
already and older releases are considered to be outdated and not
supported by the developers anymore.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you need help backporting the
fix.
