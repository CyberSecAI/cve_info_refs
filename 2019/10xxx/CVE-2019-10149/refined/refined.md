  "CVE-2019-10149": {
    "description": "A flaw was found in Exim versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive). Improper validation of recipient address in deliver_message() function in /src/deliver.c may lead to remote command execution.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Improper validation of recipient address in the `deliver_message()` function.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "The `deliver_message()` function does not properly validate the recipient address.",
	"The `expand_string()` function allows execution of arbitrary commands through the `${run{<command> <args>}}` expansion item"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote command execution as root (if `deliver_drop_privilege` is false, which is default) or the 'exim' user.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a specially crafted email with a malicious recipient address.",
        "Local exploitation by sending a mail to a local address with a crafted recipient address.",
        "Remote exploitation via non-default configurations such as removing the 'verify = recipient' ACL, using a tag in the local part, or via relaying email to a remote domain",
	"Remote exploitation by sending a mail with a large number of received headers to trigger a bounce."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can send specially crafted emails. For remote exploitation with default configuration, the attacker needs to maintain a connection to the server for 7 days, or have an authentication bypass to inject newline characters."
   },
     "affected_versions": "Exim versions 4.87 to 4.91 (inclusive).",
     "fixed_versions": "Exim version 4.92 and later.",
    "notes": "The vulnerability was fixed in Exim 4.92, but not initially identified as a security issue.  Exploitation is more direct when local or if configurations differ from defaults.  The vulnerability is in the deliver_message function, and specifically, how it handles the expansion of the recipient address string.  The vulnerability allows the use of the `${run{<command> <args>}}` expansion to run arbitrary commands."
