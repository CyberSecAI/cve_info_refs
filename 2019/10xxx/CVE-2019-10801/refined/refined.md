Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10801

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `enpeem` package is vulnerable to command injection because the `options.dir` argument is passed to the `exec` function without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:**  The lack of sanitization on user-controlled input (`options.dir`) allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system where the vulnerable application is running. This can lead to:
  - Complete system compromise.
  - Data theft or modification.
  - Denial of service.
  - Installation of malware.
- **Confidentiality Breach**: A successful exploit can lead to total loss of confidentiality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker can provide a malicious string as the `dir` property within the options object when calling the `install` or `update` functions of the `enpeem` module. This malicious string will be passed to `child_process.exec` without sanitization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the `options` argument when calling `enpeem`'s `install` or `update` functions. This likely means an attacker needs to be able to control input to an application that uses `enpeem`.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located within the `doNpmCommand` function in the `index.js` file of the `enpeem` repository.
- The `exec` function is used to execute npm commands.
- The `options.dir` parameter, which is used as the `cwd` argument to the `exec` function, is not validated, allowing command injection.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how to inject the command `& echo vulnerable > create.txt &` via the `production` field in options which is passed as argument.
  ```javascript
    var root = require("enpeem");
    var attack_code = "& echo vulnerable > create.txt &";
    var opts = {
    "production": attack_code
    }
    root.update(opts, function(){});
  ```
- The Snyk vulnerability report also categorizes this vulnerability as having a CVSS base score of 5.9 (medium) on their scale, and 9.8 (critical) on the NVD scale.

**Mitigation:**
- There is no fixed version for the `enpeem` package.
- The vulnerability could be fixed by validating and sanitizing the `options.dir` input before passing it to the `exec` function.
- It would also be beneficial to move away from `child_process.exec` for handling npm commands in favour of npm's native API, to avoid all injection vulnerabilities due to OS shell command execution.
