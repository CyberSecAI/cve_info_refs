{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the backup software not properly sanitizing or escaping user-controlled input provided through the 'user' and 'name' parameters when creating/modifying a user account.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OS Command Injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary operating system commands on the server where the Ahsay backup software is installed. This could lead to complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By making a specific API request with the crafted 'user' and 'name' parameters which would result in a command being executed. The request can be sent to 'https://[HOST]:[PORT]/obs/api/add.do'"
       ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the Ahsay server's API. No prior authentication is needed."
