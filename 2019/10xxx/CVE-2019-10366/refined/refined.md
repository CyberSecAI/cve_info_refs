Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10366:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials (likely API keys or passwords used to interact with the Skytap service) in plain text within the job configuration files (`config.xml`).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers with access to the Jenkins controller's file system or those with "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins jobs could view these unencrypted credentials. This could enable them to potentially access and control resources within the associated Skytap account.
* **Potential lateral movement:**  Exposure of these credentials could lead to further attacks on systems or applications managed by the compromised Skytap account, depending on the permissions and resources available.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system could read the `config.xml` files and extract the credentials.
*   **Jenkins UI Access:** An attacker with "Extended Read" permission for jobs within the Jenkins instance could potentially view the unencrypted credentials. This permission level allows users to view job configurations, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins Access:** The attacker requires some level of access to the Jenkins environment. This could be file system access to the Jenkins controller, or access through the Jenkins UI with "Extended Read" permissions for jobs using the vulnerable plugin.
*   **No Special Technical Skills:** The exploitation itself doesn't require sophisticated skills; it is largely a matter of accessing the relevant files or UI elements.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins.
*   The advisory indicates that the fix involves encrypting the stored credentials.
*   The vulnerability was reported by David Fiser of Trend Micro.
*   The ZDI advisory also notes the issue results from storing credentials in plaintext which an attacker can leverage to execute code in the context of the build process.
