﻿- - --= Blaze Information Security / Security Advisory --=
1. Advisory information- - - -------------------
Title: Telegram instant messenger IDN homograph attacksAdvisory reference: BLAZE-02-2019Product: TelegramDisclosure mode: Coordinated disclosure
2. Product description- - - ------------------
Telegram is a messaging app with a focus on speed and security, it’s super-fast, simple and free. You can use Telegramon all your devices at the same time — your messages sync seamlessly across any number of your phones, tablets or computers.
With Telegram, you can send messages, photos, videos and files of any type (doc, zip, mp3, etc), as well as create groupsfor up to 200,000 people or channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences. You can write to your phone contacts andfind people by their usernames. As a result, Telegram is like SMS and email combined — and can take care of all yourpersonal or business messaging needs. In addition to this, we support end-to-end encrypted voice calls.(from Telegram FAQ: https://telegram.org/faq#q-what-is-telegram-what-do-i-do-here)
3. Vulnerability details- - - --------------------
Telegram (tested on all mobile versions and Linux and Windows for desktop) is vulnerable to an IDN homographattack when displaying messages containing URLs.
Homograph attack is a security vulnerability that can deceive users into thinking they are visiting a certainwebsite when in fact they are directed to a different, but homograph, domain name. This type of vulnerability can beused to weaponize social engineering, increasing the chances for a successful attack.
Upon receiving a message with a link, Telegram renders it in a clickable format and the font used to display the messagemakes it impossible to distinguish between the legitimate URL and the malicious URL, for example:
Legitimate URL: http://blazeinfosec.comMalicious URL: http://blаzeinfosec.com - with the 'a' as a Cyrillic character, not Latin
On top of that Telegram renders a preview of the web site, making it even more deceptive for a user.
Upon clicking on the malicious link, a user will be taken to http://xn--blzeinfosec-zij.com/ instead of the realhttp://blazeinfosec.com, despite the fact the link is displayed exactly as the expected web site.
A sample attack scenario against a Telegram user:
- - An activist or person of interest uses Telegram- - The person receives a URL in a Telegram message disguised as a legitimate, Telegram renders a preview- - The user clicks on the link- - The malicious URL serves a one-click browser exploit- - Target gets infected with mobile or desktop malware
Additionally, the mobile and desktop versions of Tor Browser is vulnerable to the same classof attack. Therefore, users of Telegram with Tor Browser are prone to full-blown phishing attacks.
4. Fix and recommendations- - - ----------------------
Blaze Information Security recommends Telegram to "defang" URLs with mixed scripts (e.g., Latin and Cyrillicin the same domain name) or URLs using scripts not installed or enabled in the device should be displayed inthe message as un-clickable.
Alternatively, Telegram could implement the same strategy used by WhatsApp to mark the link as insecure, with aclear warning message to the user, when an IDN homograph domain name is encountered in the message.
The vulnerability seems to have been addressed by Telegram in its Windows version 1.5.12. The status of theother platforms is unknown, as the vendor has not responded to multiple contact attempts.
5. Credits- - - ------

6. Disclosure timeline- - - ------------------

The vendor has nevercontacted the reporter to inform about the fix.25/03/2019: Advisory released
