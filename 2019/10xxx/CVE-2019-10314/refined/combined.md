## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check allowed changing default graph configuration in analysis-core Plugin

**SECURITY-1100
/
CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`analysis-core`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/analysis-core)**

**Description:**

analysis-core Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to display trend graphs for their static analysis results.
analysis-core Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

analysis-core Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

### SiteMonitor Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-930
/
CVE-2019-10317**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sitemonitor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sitemonitor)**

**Description:**

SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that.
Instead, it now has an opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

### XXE vulnerability via UDP broadcast response in Swarm Plugin client

**SECURITY-1252
/
CVE-2019-10309**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`swarm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm)**

**Description:**

Swarm Plugin allows clients to auto-discover Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Swarm Plugin does not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
This allows unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Ansible Tower Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1355 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible-tower`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower)**

**Description:**

Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### Users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Ansible Tower Plugin

**SECURITY-1355 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10312**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible-tower`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower)**

**Description:**

Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1390
/
CVE-2019-10318**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-ad`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-ad)**

**Description:**

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global `config.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

### Twitter Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1143
/
CVE-2019-10313**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`twitter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/twitter)**

**Description:**

Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Koji Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-936
/
CVE-2019-10314**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`koji`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/koji)**

**Description:**

Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability in OAuth callback in GitHub Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-443
/
CVE-2019-10315**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to prevent CSRF.
This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim.
If the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be attached to the attackerâ€™s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

### Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1380
/
CVE-2019-10316**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

# Koji

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[Credentials stored in plain text](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-04-03/#SECURITY-1092)**
* **[SSL/TLS certificate validation globally and unconditionally disabled](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-04-30/#SECURITY-936)**

* [Documentation](/koji/)
* [Releases](/koji/releases/)
* [Issues](/koji/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/koji/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/koji/healthscore/)

This plugin enables integration with
[Koji](https://fedorahosted.org/koji/) build system providing clean-room
environment for production builds. Main focus of Koji is on
reproducibility, auditability and isolation of build executors which are
freshly provisioned each time.

This plugin focuses on Koji/Maven builds, however if there will be
requirements to work with RPM builds, Windows native builds or images in
the future, I can add the support as well and of course I will accept
your contributions.

You can use [Kojak](https://github.com/sbadakhc/kojak) scripts to easily
provision & automatically configure your own Koji instance including
configuration of the Java/maven ecosystem.

A potential usage of Jenkins-Koji plugin can be described as such:

* Run your builds using Jenkins CI, as you do now
* Once build & tests are passing and you are ready to produce a
  production build call Jenkins-Koji build step
* Jenkins-Koji plugin orchestrates the jobs in Koji, you can choose a
  "scratch build" which is a temporary build which is garbage
  collected after a time
* Once Koji is finished, use Jenkins-Koji plugin to automatically
  fetch the artifacts from Koji and for example run a set of smoke
  tests
* Once these advanced tests pass, you are ready for a full build, once
  again execute Koji build, this time a regular build, which will be
  stored permanently in Koji

Installation Requirements

Currently this plugin requires koji CLI installed on the filesystem,
limiting usage to Linux. In time the functionality of koji CLI will be
transfered to core plugin, allowing execution from various OSes.

# Description

Koji plugin is meant for orchestration of Koji instance from Jenkins CI.
The idea is to use Jenkins as a developer tool and build the production
releases via Koji.

The following features are provided by this plug-in:

* Orchestrate a Koji maven build
* Collect the results from Koji
* Find metadata about builds, packages or build targets from Koji
* Simple authentication

# How To Use

1. Download [Kojak](https://github.com/sbadakhc/kojak.git) to set up
   your own Koji environment or use [existing Koji
   instance](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Koji/RunsHere).
2. Install Koji CLI on your system (yum install koji)
3. Configure the Koji CLI to use your SSH key for Koji instance
4. Install the Koji plugin in Jenkins
5. Restart Jenkins
6. Execute Koji-plugin in Jenkins as you desire
7. Monitor build using Koji-web, Koji CLI, etc.

Step no. 3 - configuring global plugin settings:

# Roadmap

* Eliminate usage of Koji CLI to enable support for multiplatform
  Jenkins executors
* Revamp of Jelly UI
* Provide more operations
* Include rule based decisions for Koji builds based on test results /
  successful executions
* Try to provide authentication via SSL or Kerberos if desired by
  community
* Enable basic operations for RPMs

SECURITY-1100 / CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to
display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis
Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of
each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a
permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the
per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and
POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

SECURITY-930 / CVE-2019-10317
SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for
the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that. Instead, it now has an opt-in option
to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

SECURITY-1252 / CVE-2019-10309
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover
Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser
in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows
unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a
maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary
files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1355 (1) / CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)
Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer
permissions.

SECURITY-1355 (2) / CVE-2019-10312
Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be
used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1390 / CVE-2019-10318
Azure AD Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global config.xml
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Azure AD Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

SECURITY-1143 / CVE-2019-10313
Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file
on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-936 / CVE-2019-10314
Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-443 / CVE-2019-10315

prevent CSRF. This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided
during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim. If
the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be
attached to the attackerâ€™s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

SECURITY-1380 / CVE-2019-10316
Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.
