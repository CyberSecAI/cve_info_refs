Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10283:

**CVE-2019-10283**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The mabl Plugin stores credentials in an unencrypted format within the job's `config.xml` file.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The plugin stores credentials without any encryption, making them readable by unauthorized parties.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system or have the "Extended Read" permission can view the plaintext credentials. These credentials could be used to access external systems or services, potentially leading to further compromise, depending on the nature of the credentials.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files and extract the credentials.
    *   **Abuse of "Extended Read" Permission:** Users with the "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins can view the job configurations, including the sensitive credentials.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   An attacker needs to have at least one of the following:
        * Access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
        * Extended Read permission to the Jenkins instance

**Summary of CVE-2019-10283:**

The `mabl` plugin for Jenkins is vulnerable to insecure storage of credentials. The plugin stores sensitive credentials unencrypted in job configuration files (`config.xml`). This allows users with file system access or "Extended Read" permissions to view these credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access of external systems or services.
