Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause of this vulnerability is the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key within the Crimson software. This key is used to encrypt protected files, both in transit and at rest.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321):** The vulnerability lies in the fact that a static, pre-defined key is used for encryption, making the encryption weak and easily breakable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access to Configuration Files:** An attacker can potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive configuration files that are intended to be protected by encryption.
- **View Protected Data:** Successful exploitation could expose sensitive data within the configuration files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** Although the specific method of exploitation isn't detailed, the vulnerability is flagged as remotely exploitable with low skill level, indicating a potential for remote attacks.
- **Malicious Files:** An attacker could obtain the hard-coded key and use it to decrypt configuration files or create modified configurations to upload to devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low skill level:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain the hard-coded cryptographic key, but the attack itself is considered to be of a low skill level, suggesting it is not difficult to execute.
- **Access to network/files:** An attacker would require access to the network or systems where the files are being transmitted or stored.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is required as the vulnerability can be triggered when the user opens a specially crafted, malicious input file.
