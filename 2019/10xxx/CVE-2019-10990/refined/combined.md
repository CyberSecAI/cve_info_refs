## Unprecedented HMI Operator Interface Configuration & Control

![ HMI Operator Interface Configuration & Control](/sites/default/files/crimson-protocols.png)

With Crimson, simple applications can be set up quickly using a step-by-step process to configure communications protocols and define data tags for access. An extensive menu of built-in, point-and-click serial and Ethernet drivers map controller data to PLC registers in seconds. Built-in communications drivers inherently know how to talk to PLCs, PCs or SCADA systems—so no code is required to establish communication.

Red Lion’s Crimson software is a remarkable programming platform.

Delivering a powerful set of drag-and-drop configuration, display, control and data logging tools, Crimson was designed specifically to take full advantage of Red Lion's product architecture.

Red Lion's [CR1000](/products/industrial-automation/hmis-and-panel-meters/hmi-operator-panels/connected-cr1000-and-cr3000), [CR3000](/products/industrial-automation/hmis-and-panel-meters/hmi-operator-panels/connected-cr1000-and-cr3000), [Graphite](/products/industrial-automation/hmis-and-panel-meters/hmi-operator-panels/rugged-graphite-hmis) and [G3 HMIs](/products/industrial-automation/hmis-and-panel-meters/hmi-operator-panels/g3-hmis), [Graphite Core and Edge controllers](/products/industrial-automation/controllers-and-data-acquisition/industrial-controllers-and-rtus/graphite-controllers), [Modular Controller](/products/industrial-automation/controllers-and-data-acquisition/pid-controllers/modular-controllers) and [Data Station Plus](/products/industrial-automation/controllers-and-data-acquisition/data-station-plus) products have access to the widest used protocols in the automation market.

Here are just a few of the exclusive features and capabilities included with Crimson:

* An extensive library of point-and-click device drivers to quickly establish communications between Red Lion products and any device
* Built-in gateway and protocol converter to Ethernet-enable any connected device
* Multi-lingual capability with support for thousands of characters used in formats like Cyrillic or Thai that lets OEMs use a single database for global markets
* Complete library of over 5,000 industrial graphics in over 60 different categories
* Full-featured C-type syntax programming environment to extend capabilities and use advanced math, local variables, pass parameters, calls, return values and more

ICS Advisory
# Red Lion Controls Crimson

Last RevisedSeptember 16, 2019
Alert CodeICSA-19-248-01

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

* **CVSS v3 7.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Red Lion Controls
* **Equipment:** Crimson (Windows configuration software)
* **Vulnerabilities:** Use After Free, Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer, Pointer Issues, Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute code, crash the device, or view protected data.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following versions of Crimson, windows configuration software, are affected:

* Crimson Versions 3.0 and prior
* Crimson Versions 3.1 prior to release 3112.00

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [USE AFTER FREE CWE-416](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/416.html)

Multiple vulnerabilities can be exploited when a valid user opens a specially crafted, malicious input file that can reference memory after it has been freed.

[CVE-2019-10996](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10996) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [IMPROPER RESTRICTION OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF A MEMORY BUFFER CWE-119](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/119.html)

Multiple vulnerabilities can be exploited when a valid user opens a specially crafted, malicious input file that operates outside of the designated memory area.

[CVE-2019-10978](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10978) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 3.3 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.3    [POINTER ISSUES CWE-465](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/465.html)

Multiple vulnerabilities can be exploited when a valid user opens a specially crafted, malicious input file that causes the program to mishandle pointers.

[CVE-2019-10984](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10984) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [USE OF HARD-CODED CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY CWE-321](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/321.html)

Crimson uses a hard-coded password to encrypt protected files in transit and at rest, which may allow an attacker to access configuration files.

[CVE-2019-10990](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-10990) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Critical Manufacturing
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** Worldwide
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** United States

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

Michael DePlante, Anthony Fuller, and Todd Manning of Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Red Lion Controls recommends users migrate to Crimson 3.1 release 3112.00 or later where the model choice allows. Updated software can be found at the following link:

<https://www.redlion.net/red-lion-software/crimson>

The use of a hardcoded key vulnerability (CVE-2019-10990) can be mitigated in two ways:

* The user manual for Crimson 3.1 release 3112.00 now includes a paragraph describing the intended use of the database protection mechanism, noting the software is not designed to provide a cryptographically secure method of database protection.
* In a later release, targeted for September 2019, Red Lion Controls will modify the existing database protection scheme to include an option for a second file access password designed to encrypt the file.

For more information, Red Lion Controls has released a security bulletin that can be found at the following link:

<https://support.redlion.net/hc/en-us/articles/360033077531>

CISA recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Restrict system access to authorized personnel only and follow a least privilege approach.
* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.us-cert.gov/reading_room/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/cas/tips/ST04-014.html) for more information on social engineering attacks.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.gov](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
