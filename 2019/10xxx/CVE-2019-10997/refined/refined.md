- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Protocol fuzzing on the PC WORX Engineer communication port. A man-in-the-middle attack can stop the PLC service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of the communication protocol between the PC WORX Engineer and the AXC F 2152 device. Fuzzing this protocol can lead to a denial-of-service condition.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation leads to the PLC service being stopped, thus halting the execution of the PLC program. The device requires a reboot or manual restart of the PLC service via the Linux shell to recover.
- **Attack vectors:** A network-based man-in-the-middle attack is required, where an attacker intercepts and manipulates communication between the PC WORX Engineer and the AXC F 2152 controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the PC WORX Engineer and the AXC F 2152 controller and must be capable of protocol fuzzing.
