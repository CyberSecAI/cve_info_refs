Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-10308:

**CVE-2019-10308**

*   **Vulnerable Component:** Static Analysis Utilities Plugin (referred to as analysis-core Plugin in some documents).
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin's configuration form and form submission handler lacked a permission check. This allowed unauthorized users to modify the per-job graph configuration defaults.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check.
*   **Impact:** An attacker with `Job/Read` access could alter the default graph configuration for all users within a Jenkins environment.
*   **Attack Vector:** By submitting a crafted form request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs `Job/Read` permissions within the Jenkins instance.
*   **Additional Detail:** The vulnerability was coupled with a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2019-10307) because the form submission handler did not require POST requests.

**Summary:**

The Static Analysis Utilities Plugin had a vulnerability where a user with read access to a job could modify the default graph settings that would apply to all users due to a lack of permission checking. This was further compounded by the absence of POST request enforcement, leading to a CSRF vulnerability. The fix requires `Job/Configure` permission and POST request validation.
