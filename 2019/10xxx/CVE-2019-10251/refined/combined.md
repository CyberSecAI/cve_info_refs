![500+ Million Users Exposed by UC Browser for Android to MITM Attacks](https://www.bleepstatic.com/content/hl-images/2019/03/08/Android_Malware.jpg)

The extremely popular UC Browser and UC Browser Mini Android applications with a total of over 600 million installs expose their users to MiTM attacks by downloading and installing extra modules from their own servers using unprotected channels and bypassing Google Play's servers altogether.

According to a Google support document regarding Google Play "[Privacy, Security, and Deception](https://play.google.com/intl/en/about/privacy-security-deception/malicious-behavior/index.html)", Android apps "distributed via Google Play may not modify, replace, or update itself using any method other than Google Play's update mechanism. Likewise, an app may not download executable code (e.g. dex, JAR, .so files) from a source other than Google Play."

"Anyone who has installed this software may be in danger. Doctor Web has detected its hidden ability to download auxiliary components from the Internet," as detailed in Doctor Web's analysis. "The browser receives commands from the command and control server and downloads new libraries and modules, which add new features and can be used to update the software."

![UC Browser and UC Browse Mini](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/March%202019/UC%20Browser%20and%20UC%20Browse%20Mini.png)

**UC Browser and UC Browser Mini**

## Exposes users to MitM attacks

While the [UC Browser](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.UCMobile.intl&hl=en) and [UC Browser Mini](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.uc.browser.en) haven't yet been seen downloading and installing malicious code on the devices where it has been installed, given that it can download and install extra modules from its servers exposes users to potential risks.

As [Doctor Web's research team explains](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=13176&c=38&lng=en&p=0) in the report, "It’s impossible to be sure that cybercriminals will never get ahold of the browser developer’s servers or use the update feature to infect hundreds of millions of Android devices."

This unofficial update feature present in UC Browser can also be used by would-be attackers to perform man-in-the-middle attacks (MitM) attacks, potentially leading to remote code execution on compromised devices, because the app communicates with its servers using an unencrypted channel over HTTP.

> Commands to download new plug-ins are sent encrypted from the command and control server. However, UC Browser communicates with a remote host via an unprotected HTTP channel.

> — I.Zhilyakov (@m0br3v) [March 26, 2019](https://twitter.com/m0br3v/status/1110494228235411456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

Malicious actors who would successfully be able to inject their own content within the messages sent between the app and its update servers could steer the UC Browser app to download malicious modules from servers they control.

These modules would be subsequently launched on the devices where the app is installed seeing that it does not perform a check of the modules it installs —presumably because the development team considers all extra modules safe since they should only be downloaded from the company's servers.

Doctor Web's security researchers also created a MiTM attack demo video (embedded below), showing how a potential victim wants to view a PDF document using UC Browser and has to download a plug-in module to do it from the app's update servers.

The researchers intercept the message sent to the update server and replace the module with a specially crafted one designed to display a "PWNED!" message on the victim's device.

Doctor Web's researchers also mention that the UC Browser Mini application which also comes with the same update mechanism that circumvents the official Play Store update channels to download extra app modules is not affected by the MiTM vulnerability.

As Doctor Web's I. Zhilyakov told *BleepingComputer*, "This MiTM attack doesn't work against the UC Browser Mini app because it doesn't use the libpicsel library designed to work with MS Office documents and PDF files. However, it can also download and execute untested components, bypassing Google Play servers."

## **UC Browser for desktop also vulnerable**

According to *BleepingComputer*'s own findings after testing the update module available in the [desktop UC Browser app](http://www.ucweb.com/desktop/) it is also vulnerable to MiTM attacks which could allow bad actors to download malicious extensions on users' computers.

UC Browser for desktop also asks users to download extra modules for viewing PDF documents and it downloads them as Chrome extensions from the app's own update servers located in China over an insecure HTTP connection as shown in the screenshot below.

![UC Browser downloading extensions over HTTP](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1109292/March%202019/UC%20Browser%20downloding%20extensions%20over%20HTTP.png)

**UC Browser for desktop downloading extensions over HTTP**

The research team contacted Google and UCWeb Inc. (also known as UC Mobile) , the company behind the two apps, to disclose the vulnerabilities discovered in the UC Browser and UC Browser Mini apps:

Upon detecting a dangerous feature in UC Browser and UC Browser Mini, Doctor Web specialists contacted the developer of both browsers, but they refused to comment on the matter. So our malware analysts then reported the case to Google, but as of the publication date of this article, both browsers are still available and can download new components, bypassing Google Play servers.

*BleepingComputer* also reached out to UCWeb Inc. and Google for comments but had not heard back at the time of this publication. This article will be updated when responses are received.

***Update March 27 10:28 EDT***: Added Doctor Web's I. Zhilyakov explanation on why the MiTM attack does not impact the UC Browser Mini app.

***Update March 28 10:30 EDT***: A UCWeb Inc. spokesperson got back to us with a statement saying that:

```

1. Functions and abilities on UC products are created to improve user experience.
2. As per the concern, UC has updated the UC Browser app on Google Play.UC is an International company and stands by its commitment to create a product that helps millions of users access benefits of mobile internet.
```

  If I have Firefox or Chrome, why would I ever use UC? Besides, maybe it is just a backdoor designed by developers?

## Hundreds of millions of UC Browser users for Android are threatened

**March 26, 2019**

**Doctor Web malware analysts have detected a hidden ability within the popular UC Browser to download and run questionable code on mobile devices. The application is capable of downloading auxiliary software modules, bypassing Google Play servers. This violates Google Inc.’s rules and poses a serious threat because it enables any code, including malicious ones, to be downloaded to Android devices.**

As of now, UC Browser has been downloaded by over 500,000,000 Google Play users. Anyone who has installed this software may be in danger. Doctor Web has detected its hidden ability to download auxiliary components from the Internet. The browser receives commands from the command and control server and downloads new libraries and modules, which add new features and can be used to update the software.

[![#drweb](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2019/march/01_uc_ru.1.png)](https://st.drweb.com/static/new-www/news/2019/march/01_uc_en.png)

For example, during our analysis, UC Browser downloaded an executable Linux library from a remote server. The library was not malicious; it is designed to work with MS Office documents and PDF files. Initially, this library was not in the browser. After downloading, the program saved the library to its directory and launched it for execution. Thus, the application is actually able to receive and execute code, bypassing the Google Play servers. This [violates](https://play.google.com/intl/en/about/privacy-security-deception/malicious-behavior/index.html) Google’s rules for software distributed in its app store. The current policy states that applications downloaded from Google Play cannot change their own code or download any software components from third-party sources. These rules were applied to prevent the distribution of modular trojans that download and launch malicious plug-ins. Such trojans include [**Android.RemoteCode.127.origin**](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.RemoteCode.127.origin&lng=en) and [**Android.RemoteCode.152.origin**](https://vms.drweb.com/search/?q=Android.RemoteCode.152.origin&lng=en) reported by our company in [January](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=11685) and [April](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=12559) 2018.

A potentially dangerous updating feature has been present in the UC Browser since at least 2016. Although the application has not been seen distributing trojans or unwanted software, its ability to load and launch new and unverified modules poses a potential threat. It’s impossible to be sure that cybercriminals will never get ahold of the browser developer’s servers or use the update feature to infect hundreds of millions of Android devices.

The vulnerable feature of UC Browser can be used to perform man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). To download new plug-ins, the browser sends a request to the command and control server and receives a link to file in response. Since the program communicates with the server over an unsecured channel (the HTTP protocol instead of the encrypted HTTPS), cybercriminals can hook the requests from the application. They can replace the commands with ones containing different addresses. This makes the browser download new modules from malicious server instead of its own command and control server. Since UC Browser works with unsigned plug-ins, it will launch malicious modules without any verification.

See below an example of such an attack, modeled by our virus analysts. The video shows a potential victim who downloads a PDF document via UC Browser and tries to view it. To open the file, the browser tries to download the corresponding plug-in from the command and control server. However, due to the MITM substitution, the browser downloads and launches a different library. This library then creates a text message that says, “PWNED!”.

Thus, MITM attacks can help cybercriminals use UC Browser to spread malicious plug-ins that perform a wide variety of actions. For example, they can display phishing messages to steal usernames, passwords, bank card details, and other personal data. Additionally, trojan modules will be able to access protected browser files and steal passwords stored in the program directory.

The browser’s “younger brother”, the UC Browser Mini application, can also download untested components, bypassing Google Play servers. It has been equipped with this feature since at least December 2017. So far, over 100,000,000 Google Play users have downloaded the program, putting them all at risk. However, the above MITM attack will not work with UC Browser Mini, unlike UC Browser.

Upon detecting a dangerous feature in UC Browser and UC Browser Mini, Doctor Web specialists contacted the developer of both browsers, but they refused to comment on the matter. So our malware analysts then reported the case to Google, but as of the publication date of this article, both browsers are still available and can download new components, bypassing Google Play servers. Owners of Android devices should independently decide whether to continue using these programs or remove them and wait until they are updated to fix potential vulnerabilities.

Meanwhile, Doctor Web continues monitoring the situation.
