Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-10874 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Bolt CMS.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient CSRF protection in the file upload and configuration editing functionalities.
*   **Weakness:** The application allows modification of the `config.yml` file, which controls various aspects of the CMS. The CSRF vulnerability makes it possible for an attacker to induce an authenticated administrator to make unintended changes. Specifically, the exploit targets the `accept_file_types` parameter within the `config.yml` file. By modifying this parameter, the attacker can whitelist malicious file extensions like "php," enabling the upload of arbitrary PHP code.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack is initiated through a crafted HTML page containing JavaScript code. This code performs the following steps:
    1.  Uploads a "stager" HTML file to the server using a POST request to `/bolt/upload`.
    2.  The stager is then loaded in an iframe
    3.  The stager exploits a CSRF vulnerability to modify the `accept_file_types` setting in the `config.yml` file, adding extensions like `php`. It does so by sending a POST request to `/bolt/file/edit/config/config.yml`. The CSRF token is retrieved by scraping the content of the edit page.
    4.  The stager uploads a PHP webshell (`shell.php`) using a POST request to `/bolt/upload`.
*   **Impact:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious web page.
*   **Exploit Details:** The provided exploit code demonstrates a proof-of-concept CSRF attack that modifies the allowed file upload extensions and uploads a PHP webshell. The webshell can then be accessed via a direct URL, allowing the attacker to execute commands on the server.

The fix for this vulnerability involved ensuring that the `accept_file_types` configuration is an indexed array and blacklisting certain PHP file extensions.
