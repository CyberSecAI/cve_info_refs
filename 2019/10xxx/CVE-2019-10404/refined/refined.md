Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Jenkins application did not properly escape the reason why a queue item is blocked when displaying it in tooltips.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of output escaping leads to a stored XSS vulnerability. An attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the reason a queue item is blocked. This code is then executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view the tooltip.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution in User's Browser:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session when the victim hovers over a queue item tooltip.
*   **Session Hijacking**: Attackers can potentially steal session cookies or other sensitive information leading to session hijacking or account compromise
*   **Phishing:** Malicious code could redirect the victim to a phishing website
*   **Defacement:**  The attacker could alter the appearance of the page the user is on

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker with control over the blocked reason can craft a malicious string containing HTML/JavaScript. This can be achieved by creating a label expression that doesn't match any idle executors, which is a common cause of queue items being blocked.
*   When a user hovers over a queue item that was blocked due to the attacker's manipulated reason, the malicious code executes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker must have sufficient permissions to control the reason a queue item is blocked. Specifically, they would need to be able to manipulate a label expression that causes a queue item to be blocked. This is a common configuration option available in Jenkins.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is considered a medium severity
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Jenkins version 2.197 and LTS versions 2.176.4 and 2.190.1.
