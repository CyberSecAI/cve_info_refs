{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection on the endpoint responsible for adding new user accounts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can add a new administrator account to the application without the administrator's consent.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that, when submitted, sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker then tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page. This will trigger the form submission in the background through the administrator's browser.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage and trick a logged-in administrator to visit it. This can be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to inject the malicious content into a site the admin might visit."
