Based on the content provided, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10906:

**Description:** In Pallets Jinja before 2.10.1, `str.format_map` allows a sandbox escape.

**Root Cause:** Jinja incorrectly handled `str.format_map`, allowing an attacker to potentially escape the sandbox environment when rendering templates. This is similar to a previous issue with `str.format` (CVE-2016-10745) but involves a different string formatting method.

**Vulnerability:**
  *   Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
  *   Sandbox Escape

**Attack Vector:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using `{{INJECTION COMMANDS}}` within a URI or user-provided template which is then processed by Jinja.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of resources, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Systems:**
  *   Jinja2 versions before 2.10.1
  *   Systems using the Jinja sandboxed environment with user-provided templates.

**Mitigation:**
  *   Upgrade to Jinja2 version 2.10.1 or later.
  *   If upgrading is not possible, override the `is_safe_attribute` method on the sandbox and explicitly disallow the `format_map` method on string objects.

**Affected Products (From SUSE and Red Hat Advisories):**
  *   Red Hat Software Collections (various versions)
  *   Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
  *   SUSE Linux Enterprise products
  *   SUSE OpenStack Cloud
  *   HPE Helion OpenStack 8
  *   openSUSE Leap
