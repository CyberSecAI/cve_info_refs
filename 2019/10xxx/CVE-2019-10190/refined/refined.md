Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the DNS resolver component of Knot Resolver. Specifically, it stems from improper input validation when handling DNSSEC for non-existence answers (NXDOMAIN).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DNSSEC Bypass:** The resolver fails to properly validate DNSSEC signatures for NXDOMAIN responses. Instead of returning a SERVFAIL response when validation fails, it incorrectly passes the invalid NXDOMAIN response to the client.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is insufficient input validation of DNSSEC responses, leading to incorrect behavior for non-existence answers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **DNSSEC Bypass:** A remote attacker could bypass DNSSEC validation for domains that should be secured. This means an attacker can serve manipulated/forged DNS records to the resolver.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** By bypassing DNSSEC validation the attacker could potentially conduct Man-in-the-Middle attacks redirecting users to malicious servers.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely by sending crafted DNS responses to a vulnerable Knot Resolver instance.
*   **DNS Response Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the DNS response such that a forged NXDOMAIN response bypasses DNSSEC validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** An attacker must be positioned in the network path to intercept and modify DNS responses destined for a vulnerable resolver, or be in control of an authoritative DNS server.
*   **DNS Knowledge:** The attacker must have a good understanding of DNS and DNSSEC protocols, as well as the ability to craft specific malicious DNS responses.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability specifically affects how NXDOMAIN (non-existence) responses are handled, and does not directly impact caching.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the resolver correctly validates DNSSEC for non-existence answers and returns SERVFAIL when validation fails.
*   This CVE is associated with  Knot Resolver versions prior to 4.0.0
