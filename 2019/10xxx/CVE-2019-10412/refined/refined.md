## CVE-2019-10412

Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10412:

**Description:**

The Inedo ProGet Plugin stores a service password in its global Jenkins configuration. While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

*   **Vulnerability:** Sensitive information disclosure
*   **Affected Plugin:** Inedo ProGet Plugin
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin transmits the service password in plain text when displaying the configuration form, despite storing it encrypted on disk.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker could potentially intercept the plain text password through various means:
    *   Browser extensions with malicious intent
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that could steal the password from the configuration page.
    *   Network sniffing if the connection is not properly secured (although this is less likely given the context).
*   **Impact:** Exposure of the service password, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the associated service.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to view the Jenkins configuration form while the password is being displayed. This could be achieved through local access or by exploiting a separate XSS vulnerability.
*   **Fix:** The plugin now encrypts the password transmitted to administrators viewing the global configuration form.
*   **Severity (CVSS):** Low
