- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `phppgadmin/phppgadmin` application does not properly validate the source of HTTP requests, specifically in `database.php`. This allows an attacker to perform sensitive actions without verifying the request's origin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The application does not verify the source of HTTP requests before executing sensitive actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious page with a CSRF exploit. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where phppgadmin is hosted, leading to a potential compromise of the system. Full confidentiality loss is possible, with potential modification of data, and no impact to availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to induce a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious webpage that contains the crafted CSRF exploit. This can be achieved through social engineering techniques like phishing or using malicious links on other websites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to craft malicious HTML and JavaScript capable of performing CSRF attacks against the phppgadmin application and trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a page containing the exploit. The attacker can be remotely located, as the vulnerability is network exploitable. The attacker also needs to understand the specific actions that can be performed within `database.php` to craft a malicious request.
