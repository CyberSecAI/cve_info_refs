## Analysis of CVE-2019-10197

Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10197:

**1. Description of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists in Samba versions 4.9.0 and later.
*   It allows an attacker to escape the defined share path and access the complete '/' filesystem.
*   This occurs due to a combination of specific parameter settings in the `smb.conf` file and inadequate permission checks.

**2. Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is reproducible if the `wide links` option is explicitly set to `yes` and either `unix extensions = no` or `allow insecure wide links = yes` is also set.
*   If a client is denied access to the share root directory, `smbd` caches this failure. Subsequent SMB requests then operate in the wrong directory (either the share root of a different share or the global root directory '/'), rather than returning ACCESS\_DENIED.
*   The cache remembering if the daemon successfully changed to a directory was not being reset on failure.

**3. Attack Vector:**

*   A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to connect to a Samba SMB server.
*   The attacker must be a user that does not have permissions to enter the share root directory.
*   The attacker is then able to access any file on the system assuming they have proper Linux DAC permissions.

**4. Impact:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information by viewing files outside the intended share.
*   **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify data if they have write permissions on the files outside the intended share.
*   A successful exploit could lead to disclosure of sensitive information or addition or modification of data.

**5. Affected Configurations:**

*   The vulnerability occurs when the `wide links` option is explicitly set to `yes` and either `unix extensions = no` or `allow insecure wide links = yes` is set in addition.

**6. Mitigation:**

*   Use the `sharesec` tool to configure a security descriptor for the share that's at least as strict as the permissions on the share root directory.
*   Use the `valid users` option to allow only users/groups which are able to enter the share root directory.
*   Remove `wide links = yes` if it's not required.
*   Apply `chmod a+x` on the share root directory, ensuring that files and subdirectories are protected by stricter permissions. Consider `chmod a-w` to prevent new top-level files and directories with less restrictive permissions.

**7. Affected Products (as per NetApp Advisory):**

The NetApp advisory states that none of their products were affected by this vulnerability.

**8. Fixed Versions:**

*   Samba versions 4.9.13, 4.10.8, and 4.11.0rc3 and later.

**9. CVSS Score:**

*   CVSS v3.0 score of 8.7 (Critical) according to Samba.
    `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C (8.7)`
*   CVSS v3.0 score of 9.1 (Critical) according to NVD.
    `CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
*   Red Hat rated the severity as Moderate.
*   SUSE rated the severity as Important and provided a score of 7.5.

**10. Additional Notes:**

*   The attack is restricted by standard Linux DAC permissions, and SELinux permissions may further restrict access.
*   The vulnerability exists in the Samba server. Client-side packages are not affected.
*   Red Hat states that only Samba configurations where the `wide links` option is explicitly set to `yes` are affected and that default configurations of Samba packages shipped with Red Hat products are not affected.
