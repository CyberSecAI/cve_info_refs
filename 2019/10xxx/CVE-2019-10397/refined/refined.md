Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10397:

**Root Cause:**
The Aqua Security Serverless Scanner Plugin was transmitting service passwords in plain text as part of the job configuration form, even though the passwords were stored encrypted on disk.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  Plain text transmission of sensitive data (passwords).
-  The password was exposed in the HTML source of the job configuration form.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of service passwords, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the associated services.
- The vulnerability could be exploited via:
    - Browser extensions.
    - Cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
    - Similar situations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could potentially observe the password through browser extensions, XSS, or similar means by inspecting the HTML source of the job configuration form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be in a position to observe the plain text password during the configuration form's transmission or when the form is rendered in a browser. This can be done via network inspection (if an attacker is on the same network segment), or through malicious browser extensions or via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

**Additional Notes:**
- While the passwords were encrypted on disk, the lack of encryption during transmission and rendering in the form created the vulnerability.
- The fix involves preventing the password form field from being transmitted in plain text.
