The provided content is related to CVE-2019-10244, not CVE-2019-10242. The bug report explicitly mentions "CVE-2019-10244" along with the summary "Possible XXE attacks to XML parsers".

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper configuration of XML factories and parsers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**  Potential for XXE attacks. The specific impacts of XXE (e.g., information disclosure, SSRF) are not detailed here but are generally implied.

**Attack vectors:** Exploiting vulnerable XML parsers in the Kura framework (specifically, Web UI package and component services, the Artemis simple Mqtt component, and the emulator position service, the last of which is not part of the device distribution.)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be able to supply crafted XML data to the vulnerable XML parsers. The report does not explicitly state where this crafted XML can be supplied; however it is reasonable to assume it is through one of the aforementioned vulnerable services.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Eclipse Kura versions up to 4.0.0.
- Fixes are implemented in Kura version 4.1.0 by properly configuring XML factories and parsers.
- The bug report references a pull request that addresses the issue.
