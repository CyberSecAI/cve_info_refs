Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10083:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the API response when updating a Process Group. The response included the entire contents of the process group (at the top level), including details about processors and controller services. This occurred even when the user lacked the necessary read access to those specific components within the group.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The API response revealed sensitive information about processors and controller services within a process group to users who should not have access to them.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The system failed to properly prune or filter the API response based on the user's access permissions, leading to the disclosure of potentially confidential data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access to Component Details:** Attackers could gain knowledge about the inner workings and configurations of Process Groups, including details about processors and controller services, even if they lack the specific read access permissions.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowledge of the inner details can be used to inform further attacks by a malicious insider.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **API Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered when updating a Process Group via the NiFi API. An authenticated user with the ability to update Process Groups can trigger the vulnerability and see the details of processors and controller services within a process group, regardless of their access to them.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Apache NiFi.
- **Permission to Update Process Groups:** The attacker must have the authorization to update process groups.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in Apache NiFi version 1.10.0 by modifying the API response to no longer include the contents of the process group when a request is made to update or remove a Process Group.
