Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization within the plain text editor of Apache JSPWiki, specifically when handling plugin links. A crafted plugin link could be injected and executed without proper escaping or sanitization, leading to XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. By injecting malicious code within a plugin link, an attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:**  This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information about the victim, including session cookies or other data.
*   **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could potentially perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim, such as defacing pages, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on the user's behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Plugin Links:** The attack vector is based on specially crafted plugin links that include malicious JavaScript.
*   **Plain Editor:** The vulnerability exists specifically in the handling of plugin links within the plain text editor of JSPWiki.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Edit Pages:** An attacker would need the ability to edit wiki pages, specifically the ability to use the plain text editor.
*   **Knowledge of JSPWiki Syntax:**  The attacker would need to know how to craft plugin links to inject the malicious JavaScript code.

**Additional Details**
*   The vulnerability is present in JSPWiki versions up to 2.11.0.M4
*   The fix is included in 2.11.0.M5 or later
*   This vulnerability was discovered by Dirk Frederickx, an Apache JSPWiki developer.
