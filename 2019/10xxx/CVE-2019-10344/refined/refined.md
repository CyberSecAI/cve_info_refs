Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10344:

**CVE-2019-10344**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Configuration as Code plugin provided URLs for accessing the generated schema and reference documentation that lacked proper permission checks.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Missing Authorization:** The plugin failed to enforce permission checks on URLs serving the schema and reference documentation.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** This allowed unauthorized access to sensitive information about the Jenkins instance and its installed plugins.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Users with Overall/Read access could access the schema and reference documentation. This could expose detailed information about installed plugins, potentially revealing details that wouldn't be available through the normal UI.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance could navigate to the vulnerable URLs to access the configuration schema and reference documentation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.

**Summary of the fix:**
Access to these URLs is now restricted to users with Overall/Administer permission.
