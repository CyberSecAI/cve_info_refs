Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a heap-based buffer overflow during the parsing of DPB files in Delta Industrial Automation CNCSoft ScreenEditor.

**Weaknesses:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data lengths before copying them into a heap-based buffer. Specifically, two separate advisories, ZDI-19-405 and ZDI-19-408, identify the same root cause, but point to different data fields, `wTextLen` and `wLanguageNameLen` respectively, that are not properly validated during DPB file parsing.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Administrator, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack requires user interaction.
*   The user must either visit a malicious page or open a malicious DPB file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to craft a malicious DPB file with specific data lengths exceeding the buffer's capacity.
* The attacker can be remote.
* The attacker needs to induce the user to interact with the malicious DPB file.

**Additional Details:**
*   Delta Industrial Automation has released an update to fix this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2019-01-11.
*   The coordinated public release of the advisory was on 2019-04-17.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson).
