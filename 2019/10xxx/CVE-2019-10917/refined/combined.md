WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply Defense-in-Depth

• Enable “Encrypted communication” in SIMATIC WinCC and SIMATIC PCS 7.

• Only open project ﬁles from trusted locations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC WinCC is a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system.

SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Professional is a visualization runtime platform used for operator control and
monitoring of machines and plants.

SIMATIC WinCC (TIA Portal) is an engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC Panels,
SIMATIC Industrial PCs, and Standard PCs running WinCC Runtime Advanced or SCADA System WinCC
Runtime Professional visualization software.

SIMATIC PCS 7 is a distributed control system (DCS) integrating SIMATIC WinCC and other components.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10916

An attacker with access to the project ﬁle could run arbitrary system commands with the privileges of
the local database server.

The vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker with access to the project ﬁle. The vulnerability
does impact the conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.
