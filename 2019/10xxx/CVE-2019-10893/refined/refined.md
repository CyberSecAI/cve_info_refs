{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user input in the Admin Email fields within the \"CWP Settings > Edit Settings\" screen.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Stored/Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application also lacks validation or checks to ensure the user input is a valid email address.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the web application by crafting a malicious payload in the email field. This could lead to unauthorized actions, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can inject an XSS payload into the email address field through the web interface. The payload is stored in the database and executed when the settings page is loaded.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have administrative access to the CentOS Web Panel to modify the email field under 'CWP Settings > Edit Settings'."
