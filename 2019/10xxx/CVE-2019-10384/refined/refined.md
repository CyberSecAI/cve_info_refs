Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10384:

**Root Cause:**

- Jenkins allowed the creation of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens without associating them with a web session ID. This was due to an incomplete fix from a previous security issue (SECURITY-626).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper CSRF Token Handling:** CSRF tokens generated for anonymous users were not tied to a session, making them persistent and reusable.
- **Incomplete Fix:** The initial fix for SECURITY-626 did not fully address the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **CSRF Attacks:** Attackers could potentially use these persistent CSRF tokens to perform actions on behalf of anonymous users.
- **Compromise of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability**: While the actions are limited to what anonymous users can do, it still allows attackers to cause unwanted impact, as noted in the bug description's Doc Text.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack could be performed over a network if the attacker can obtain a CSRF token.
- **Exploiting Anonymous Access:** The vulnerability could be used if the anonymous user has certain permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **CSRF Token Acquisition:** The attacker needs to acquire a CSRF token generated for an anonymous user.
- **Victim Constraints:**
    - The victim must not have a valid web session at the time of the attack.
    - The victim's IP address needs to remain unchanged unless the proxy compatibility option is enabled.
- **Understanding of Jenkins:** The attacker should have some basic understanding of how Jenkins CSRF protection and anonymous user permissions work.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue affects Jenkins versions up to and including 2.191 (weekly) and 2.176.2 (LTS).
- The fix involves ensuring that CSRF token generation always creates a web session if none exists.
- A workaround is to revoke permissions for the anonymous user. The "Strict Crumb Issuer" plugin can also be used instead of the built in issuer.
- Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 and 3.11 were affected by this vulnerability.
