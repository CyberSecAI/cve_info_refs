Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10370:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Mask Passwords Plugin transmits passwords in plain text as part of the configuration form, even though they are stored encrypted on disk.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext transmission of sensitive data (passwords)
- Lack of proper masking or encryption during form submission

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exposure of passwords through browser extensions.
- Exposure of passwords due to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Exposure of passwords in similar situations where data in transit is vulnerable to interception.

**Attack vectors:**
- Browser extensions intercepting data in transit.
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities on the Jenkins instance, allowing attackers to steal data from forms.
- Man-in-the-middle attacks on network traffic between the browser and the Jenkins server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to install or control a browser extension on a user's browser.
- Ability to execute arbitrary scripts on the Jenkins instance through a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- Ability to intercept network traffic between the browser and the Jenkins server (e.g., man-in-the-middle).
- No specific user privilege is mentioned.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability exists because the plugin transmits the password in plain text when displaying/submitting the global configuration form.
- This issue was discovered by Matthias Schmalz, SAP SE.
- There is no fix available for this vulnerability as of the date of the security advisory.
