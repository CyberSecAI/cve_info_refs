described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1497 / CVE-2019-10367
Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins
system log. Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with
asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure. Configuration as
Code Plugin inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor
argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much
more robust for the purpose of log message masking. This was implemented in
the fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory.

That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the
logger io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator.

SECURITY-1482 / CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)
JClouds Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in
Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-157 / CVE-2019-10370
Mask Passwords Plugin allows specifying passwords to be provided to builds
in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the passwords are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure
of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-795 / CVE-2019-10371
Gitlab Authentication Plugin does not invalidate the previous session and
create a new one upon successful login. This allows attackers able to
control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

SECURITY-796 / CVE-2019-10372
Gitlab Authentication Plugin records the HTTP Referer header when the
authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL when the user
has finished logging in.

This implements an open redirect, allowing malicious sites to implement a
phishing attack, with users expecting they have just logged in to Jenkins.

SECURITY-879 / CVE-2019-10373
Build Pipeline Plugin does not properly escape variables in views,
resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
users with permission to configure build pipelines.

This vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins releases older than 2.146
or 2.138.2 due to the security hardening implemented in those releases.

SECURITY-142 / CVE-2019-10374
PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to implement support for
rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins. It advertises
disabling of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.

PegDown Formatter Plugin does not prevent the use of javascript: scheme in
URLs for links. This results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users
able to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are
rendered by the configured markup formatter.

SECURITY-569 / CVE-2019-10375
File System SCM Plugin allows users able to configure jobs to read
arbitrary files from the Jenkins master, even if the job is running on an
agent.

SECURITY-751 / CVE-2019-10376
Wall Display Master Project Plugin does not properly escape the customTheme
query parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-1099 / CVE-2019-10377
Avatar Plugin does not implement a permission check for the HTTP URL used
to replace user avatars. This allows any user with Overall/Read permission
to change any other user’s avatar, in addition to their own.

SECURITY-1428 / CVE-2019-10378
TestLink Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration
file hudson.plugins.testlink.TestLinkBuilder.xml on the Jenkins master.
These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the master file
system.

SECURITY-591 / CVE-2019-10379
Google Cloud Messsaging Notification Plugin stores an API key unencrypted
in its global configuration file org.jenkinsci.plugins.gcm.im.GcmPublisher.
xml on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-922 / CVE-2019-10380
Simple Travis Pipeline Runner Plugin defines a custom whitelist for scripts
protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass
Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code
execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

SECURITY-931 / CVE-2019-10381
Codefresh Integration Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate
validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1376 / CVE-2019-10382
VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS
certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1430 / CVE-2019-10385
eggPlant Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1008 / CVE-2019-10386 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10387 (permission check)
XL TestView Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1053 / CVE-2019-10388 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10389 (permission check)
A missing permission check in a form validation method in Relution
Enterprise Appstore Publisher Plugin allows users with Overall/Read
permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL using
attacker-specified credentials and attacker-specified HTTP proxy
configuration.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

# TestLink

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Credentials stored in plain text](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-08-07/#SECURITY-1428)**This plugin is up for adoption!** We are looking for new maintainers. Visit our [Adopt a Plugin](https://jenkins.io/doc/developer/plugin-governance/adopt-a-plugin/) initiative for more information.

* [Documentation](/testlink/)
* [Releases](/testlink/releases/)
* [Issues](/testlink/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/testlink/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/testlink/healthscore/)

This plug-in integrates Jenkins and [TestLink](http://testlink.org/) and
generates reports on automated test execution. With this plug-in you can
manage your tests in TestLink, schedule and control in Jenkins, and
execute using your favorite test execution tool (TestPartner, Selenium,
TestNG, Perl modules, PHPUnit, among others).

This plug-in is not part of TestLink project, issues regarding Jenkins
and TestLink integration must be reported in [Jenkins
JIRA](http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/). It has been reported by users that
it is also possible to use ReportNG, as this tool has an option to
output TestNG XML too.

When filing an issue, remember to include as much data as possible, but
avoid including sensitive data, as attachments can take a while to be
deleted from JIRA, as the process is manual and quite troublesome

#### [Who is using Jenkins TestLink Plug-in](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Who%2Bis%2Busing%2BTestLink%2BPlug-in)

[Let us know if you are using this
plug-in.](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Who%2Bis%2Busing%2BTestLink%2BPlug-in)

## Description

The TestLink plug-in integrates **Jenkins** with
[TestLink](http://testlink.org/). TestLink plug-in uses
[testlink-java-api](http://testlinkjavaapi.sourceforge.net/ "testlink-java-api")
to access TestLink **XML-RPC** API. With the information that you
provide in the build step configuration the plug-in **retrieves
automated tests from TestLink**. With the plug-in, you are able to
execute **build steps** that call testing tools. It reads **TestNG**,
**JUnit** and **TAP** test report **formats**, used to update TestLink
test cases' executions.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/1.png){width="900"}

The job configuration changed! Now there are three sections, what helps
you to configure your job, and add extra build steps, result seeking
strategies and general information about TestLink.

TestLink configuration section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/001.PNG){width="900"}

Test Execution section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/002.PNG){width="900"}

And Result Seeking Strategy section

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/003.PNG){width="900"}

You can use environment variables in Test project name, Test plan name
or Build name. For instance, build-project-$BUILD\_NUMBER would be
replaced by build-project- and the number of the Build executed in
Jenkins.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/testlink/docs/images/5.png){width="900"}

#### How does the plug-in execute my automated tests?

TestLink Plug-in retrieves automated test cases data from TestLink. This
data is then set as environment variables. This way your build steps can
make use of this information to execute your automated tests.

For instance, you could run ant passing a Test Class as parameter, more
or less something like this, /opt/java/apache-ant-1.8.0/bin/ant
-DtestClass=$TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TEST\_CLASS. In this case, Test Case is
the name of a custom field in TestLink.

List of environment variables available during TestLink Plug-in
execution of single build steps
([JENKINS-17622](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-17622)):

* TESTLINK\_BUILD\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTPLAN\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTPROJECT\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TOTAL

List of environment variables available during TestLink Plug-in
execution of iterative build steps:

* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_ID
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TESTPROJECTID
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_AUTHOR
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_SUMMARY
* TESTLINK\_BUILD\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TESTSUITEID
* TESTLINK\_TESTPLAN\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTPROJECT\_NAME
* TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_$CUSTOM\_FIELD\_NAME

For each Custom Field found, TestLink Plug-in defines an environment
variable for with its name and value, as shown above
(%CUSTOM\_FIELD\_NAME%). If the custom field name contains spaces the
plug-in will convert them into \_'s. i.e., Test Class can be accessed as
%TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TEST\_CLASS% in Windows or
$TESTLINK\_TESTCASE\_TEST\_CLASS in \*nix-like systems.

For each test case, the plug-in executes one call for each custom field.
In other words, if you have 1000 tests in a test plan, the plug-in will
execute a lot of calls to TestLink, downgrading the execution of your
job.

#### How does the plug-in know if a test passed or failed?

You can choose among different **result seeking strategies** in your job
configuration. The plug-in supports three **result formats**, *TestNG*,
*JUnit* and *TAP*.

###### TestNG result seeking strategies

**TestNG class name**: The plug-in matches the TestNG class name (e.g.:
org.tap4j.TestParser) and the key custom field value.

**TestNG method name**: The plug-in matches the TestNG method name
(e.g.: org.tap4j.TestParser#testTokenizer) and the key custom field
value.

**TestNG suite name**: The plug-in matches the TestNG suite name (e.g.:
functional tests) and the key custom field value.

###### JUnit result seeking strategies

**JUnit case class name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit case class name
(e.g.: org.tap4j.TestParser) and the key custom field value.

**JUnit case name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit case class name
(e.g.: testTokenizer) and the key custom field value.

**JUnit method name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit case class name
(e.g.: org.tap4j.TestParser#testTokenizer) and the key custom field
value.

**JUnit suite name**: The plug-in matches the JUnit suite name
(e.g.:functional tests) and the key custom field value.

###### TAP result seeking strategies

**TAP file name**: The plug-in matches the TAP file name (e.g.:
testFtpProtocol.tap) and the key custom field value.

**TAP file name multiple test points:** Adds one test execution in
TestLink for each TAP Test Result with its execution status

## Configuration

1. Download and install the latest version of TestLink
   (<http://testlink.org/>).
2. Create automated tests in TestLink with Custom Field for automation.
3. Install the TestLink plug-in from the Jenkins Plugin Manager
4. Define a TestLink configuration from the Configure System page.

## Descriptions

### Configuration as Code Plugin failed to mask secrets in system log messages

**SECURITY-1497
/
CVE-2019-10367**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.
Configuration as Code Plugin inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.
This was implemented in the [fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory](/security/advisory/2019-07-31/#SECURITY-1279).

That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator`.

Configuration as Code Plugin now uses the same secret detection for these log messages.

As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator` to a level that does not include these messages.
Configuration as Code Plugin 1.25 and earlier logs these messages at the `INFO` level, Configuration as Code Plugin 1.26 logs them at `FINE`.
See [the logging documentation](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) for details.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in JClouds Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1482
/
CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jclouds-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jclouds-jenkins)**

**Description:**

JClouds Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.

### Mask Passwords Plugin shows plain text passwords in global configuration form fields

**SECURITY-157
/
CVE-2019-10370**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mask-passwords`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mask-passwords)**

**Description:**

Mask Passwords Plugin allows specifying passwords to be provided to builds in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the passwords are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### HTTP session fixation vulnerability in GitLab Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-795
/
CVE-2019-10371**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitLab Authentication Plugin does not invalidate the previous session and create a new one upon successful login.
This allows attackers able to control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Open redirect vulnerability in GitLab Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-796
/
CVE-2019-10372**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitLab Authentication Plugin records the HTTP `Referer` header when the authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL when the user has finished logging in.

This implements an open redirect, allowing malicious sites to implement a phishing attack, with users expecting they have just logged in to Jenkins.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Build Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-879
/
CVE-2019-10373**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`build-pipeline-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/build-pipeline-plugin)**

**Description:**

Build Pipeline Plugin does not properly escape variables in views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with permission to configure build pipelines.

This vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins releases older than 2.146 or 2.138.2 due to the [security hardening implemented in those releases](/blog/2018/10/10/security-updates/).

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in PegDown Formatter Plugin

**SECURITY-142
/
CVE-2019-10374**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pegdown-formatter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pegdown-formatter)**

**Description:**

PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to implement support for rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins.
It advertises disabling of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.

PegDown Formatter Plugin does not prevent the use of `javascript:` scheme in URLs for links.
This results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are rendered by the configured markup formatter.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in File System SCM Plugin

**SECURITY-569
/
CVE-2019-10375**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`filesystem_scm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/filesystem_scm)**

**Description:**

File System SCM Plugin allows users able to configure jobs to read arbitrary files from the Jenkins controller, even if the job is running on an agent.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Wall Display Master Project Plugin

**SECURITY-751
/
CVE-2019-10376**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jenkinswalldisplay`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jenkinswalldisplay)**

**Description:**

Wall Display Master Project Plugin does not properly escape the `customTheme` query parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Avatar Plugin allows changing other users' avatars

**SECURITY-1099
/
CVE-2019-10377**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`avatar`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/avatar)**

**Description:**

Avatar Plugin does not implement a permission check for the HTTP URL used to replace user avatars.
This allows any user with Overall/Read permission to change any other user’s avatar, in addition to their own.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### TestLink Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1428
/
CVE-2019-10378**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`testlink`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/testlink)**

**Description:**

TestLink Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.testlink.TestLinkBuilder.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Google Cloud Messaging Notification Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-591
/
CVE-2019-10379**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gcm-notification`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gcm-notification)**

**Description:**

Google Cloud Messaging Notification Plugin stores an API key unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gcm.im.GcmPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Script sandbox bypass vulnerability in Simple Travis Pipeline Runner Plugin

**SECURITY-922
/
CVE-2019-10380**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`simple-travis-runner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/simple-travis-runner)**

**Description:**

Simple Travis Pipeline Runner Plugin defines a custom list of pre-approved signatures for scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom list of pre-approved signatures allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass Script Security sandbox protection.
