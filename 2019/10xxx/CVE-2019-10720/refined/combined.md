BlogEngine.NET Directory Traversal + Remote Code execution

# BlogEngine.NET Directory Traversal + Remote Code execution

**Author:**Aaron Bishop

# CVE Disclosure

# CVE-2019-10719

---

A remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, **CVE-2019-10719**, was discovered in BlogEngine 3.3.7 and earlier. Leveraging a path traversal in /api/upload , a malicious file could be written to a directory which would allow it to be accessed and executed. **Edit post** permissions are required to upload the shell. Anyone can trigger the shell without authentication.

### Vendor Patch

---

* <https://github.com/rxtur/BlogEngine.NET/releases/tag/v3.3.8.0>

### Timeline

---

* 30 Mar 2019 - Issue Identified
* 31 Mar 2019 - Developer contacted
* 04 Apr 2019 - Details of vulnerability sent
* 17 Jun 2019 - Public Disclosure

### Description

---

BlogEngine.NET allows users to upload files through the /api/upload endpoint. Files uploaded using **file**, **filemgr**, or **image** as the action ultimately call BlogService.UploadFile and create the file:

##### BlogEngine/BlogEngine.NET/AppCode/Api/UploadController.cs

```
if (action == "filemgr" || action == "file")
{
    string[] ImageExtensnios = { ".jpg", ".png", ".jpeg", ".tiff", ".gif", ".bmp" };

    if (ImageExtensnios.Any(x => fileName.ToLower().Contains(x.ToLower()))) action = "image";
    else
        action = "file";
}
...
if (action == "image")
{
    if (Security.IsAuthorizedTo(Rights.EditOwnPosts))
    {
        dir = BlogService.GetDirectory(dirName);
        var uploaded = BlogService.UploadFile(file.InputStream, fileName, dir, true);
        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, uploaded.AsImage.ImageUrl);
    }
}
if (action == "file")
{
    if (Security.IsAuthorizedTo(Rights.EditOwnPosts))
    {
        dir = BlogService.GetDirectory(dirName);
        var uploaded = BlogService.UploadFile(file.InputStream, fileName, dir, true);
        retUrl = uploaded.FileDownloadPath + "|" + fileName + " (" + BytesToString(uploaded.FileSize) + ")";
        return Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, retUrl);
    }
}

```

The **dirPath** parameter is used to specify a folder the file will be written to. **dirPath** is vulnerable to directory traversal, allowing files to be written to any directory.

A malicious PostView.ascx can be written to a sub-directory of **/Custom/Themes**, bypassing the fix for **CVE-2019-6714**. If the folder does not exist, it will be created and contain the malicious PostView.ascx.

### Exploit

---

* <https://github.com/irbishop/CVEs/blob/master/2019-10719/exploit.py>

The following will upload the file to **/Custom/Themes/RCE\_Test**. **RCE\_Test**will be created if it does not exist:

# CVE-2019-10720

---

A remote code execution (RCE) attack, CVE-2019-10720, exists on BlogEngine.NET versions 3.3.7 and earlier. A user with privileges to add/upload files could upload a malicious `PostView.ascx` file and exploit a directory traversal in the **theme** cookie to trigger the RCE.

### Vendor Patch

---

* <https://github.com/rxtur/BlogEngine.NET/releases/tag/v3.3.8.0>

### Timeline

---

* Identified: 30 Mar 2019
* Initial Developer Contact: 31 Mar 2019
* Issue Disclosed: 17 Jun 2019

### Description

---

The application will use the **theme** cookie if the **theme** parameter is not set:

**BlogEngine.Core/BlogSettings.cs**
```
413         public string Theme
414         {
415             get
416             {
417                 var context = HttpContext.Current;
418                 if (context != null)
419                 {
420                     var request = context.Request;
421                     if (request.QueryString["theme"] != null)
422                     {
423                         return request.QueryString["theme"];
424                     }
425
426                     var cookie = request.Cookies[this.ThemeCookieName];
427                     if (cookie != null)
428                     {
429                         return cookie.Value;
430                     }
```

The **theme** cookie is vulnerable to a directory traversal; the **theme** cookie can be set to a folder that contains a malicious `PostView.ascx`, such as `.../../App_Data/files`. The malicious code contained in `PostView.ascx` will be executed.

### Exploit

---

* <https://github.com/irbishop/CVEs/blob/master/2019-10720/exploit.py>

A malicious file can be uploaded using `File Manager` in the application, `/api/upload?action=file`, or `/api/upload?action=filemgr`. In the following example `/api/upload?action=file` is used to upload the malicious `PostView.ascx` file:

```
POST /api/upload?action=file HTTP/1.1

# BlogEngine.NET Directory traversal + RCE

---

*From*: aaron bishop <abishop () linux com>

*Date*: Mon, 17 Jun 2019 17:33:25 -0600

---

```
BlogEngine.NET, versions 3.3.7 and earlier, is vulnerable to two separate
Directory Traversal issues that can lead to Remote Code Execution.

CVE-2019-10719 exploits a directory traversal in /api/upload, allowing
users to write files to any location within the web root.  This bypasses
the protection added in version 3.3.7 to prevent CVE-2019-6714.  A user,
with the ability to add images or files to posts, can upload a malicious
PostView.ascx file to the Themes folder.  The code could then be triggered
by setting the theme parameter to the newly create folder.

CVE-2019-10720 exploits a directory traversal in the theme cookie to
trigger a remote code execution.  A user, with the ability to add images or
files to posts, can upload a malicious PostView.ascx file, then trigger the
RCE by setting the theme cookie to ../../App_Data/files.

# Fulldisclosure -- Improving network security through full disclosure

## About Fulldisclosure

The Full Disclosure mailing list is a public forum for detailed discussion of vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques, as well as tools, papers, news, and events of interest to the community. FD differs from other security lists in its open nature and support for researchers' right to decide how to disclose their own discovered bugs. The [full disclosure movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_disclosure_%28computer_security%29) has been credited with forcing vendors to better secure their products and to publicly acknowledge and fix flaws rather than hide them. Vendor legal intimidation and censorship attempts are not tolerated here!

This list is meant as a spiritual successor to the [grok.org.uk Full-Disclosure list](http://lists.grok.org.uk/full-disclosure-charter.html) started by Len Rose and John Cartwright in 2002 and [terminated abruptly in March 2014](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/332) due to bogus legal threats. We are giving this list a fresh start, so members of the old list need to resubscribe here.

This list is run by and for the network security community. Moderation is performed by a team of volunteers using our [moderation guidelines](https://secwiki.org/w/FD_Moderation). Time is truly of the essence in vulnerability disclosure, so we try to keep the moderation delay short. When we need more moderators we will recruit from the most active and insightful list members.

You must join the list before you can post to it. Submit posts to fulldisclosure@seclists.org. If you don't want list message delivery to the address you post from, you can disable it in [list config](https://nmap.org/mailman/options/fulldisclosure).

Posts are publicly archived at the [Seclists.org Full Disclosure web archive](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure) and the list RSS feed is available there too. Various unofficial archives exist as well. You can prevent archiving (at least for Seclists) by specifying the [X-No-Archive mail header](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-No-Archive) in your post, but you might reconsider whether to post such a sensitive message to a public list in the first place.

Given the light moderation policy and that we generally don't verify posted information, and that email forgery is easy, deal with all list content at your own risk! In particular, running any "exploit scripts" or executables posted to this list can be disastrous.

## Using Fulldisclosure

To post a message to all the list members, send email to
fulldisclosure@seclists.org.

You can subscribe to the list, or change your existing
subscription, in the sections below.
## Subscribing to Fulldisclosure
