Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-10720:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue within the `theme` cookie handling of BlogEngine.NET. The application uses the value of the `theme` cookie to determine which theme to load if a `theme` parameter is not provided in the URL. This cookie value is not properly sanitized, allowing attackers to use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`) to point to arbitrary locations within the file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The application does not validate or sanitize the `theme` cookie value, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences to access files outside of the intended theme directory.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By combining the directory traversal with the ability to upload files, an attacker can upload a malicious `PostView.ascx` file (ASP.NET user control) to a known location and then use the directory traversal vulnerability in the theme cookie to force the application to execute the malicious code within the `PostView.ascx` file, leading to RCE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary remote code execution on the server. This would allow an attacker to:
- Gain complete control of the web server
- Steal sensitive data
- Install malware
- Disrupt service

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to upload a malicious `PostView.ascx` file to the server using the `/api/upload` endpoint. This requires a user with the privilege to add/upload files.
- The attacker then sends a request to the server including a crafted theme cookie that points to the location where the malicious `PostView.ascx` file was uploaded, triggering the RCE.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the ability to upload files through the `File Manager` or by directly using the `/api/upload` endpoint.
- No other authentication is needed to trigger the exploit if the attacker can set a cookie.
- The attacker needs to know the location of the uploaded file.
