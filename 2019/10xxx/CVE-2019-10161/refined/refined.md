{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The libvirt management API exposed unintended functionality to API clients with read-only permissions. Specifically, the `virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc()` API allowed read-only clients to specify an arbitrary path which would be accessed with the permissions of the libvirtd process.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inadequate access control for read-only API clients.",
      "Exposure of privileged operations to unprivileged users.",
       "Lack of input validation on file paths provided to the `virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc` API."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with access to the libvirtd socket could use this to probe the existence of arbitrary files, cause denial of service, or cause libvirtd to execute arbitrary programs. In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, this could lead to full root compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the libvirtd socket (typically `/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro`). Network access may be possible if `listen_tcp` is enabled in `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf`.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker requires local access to the libvirt read-only socket, or network access if configured. For privilege escalation to root, attacker needs access to a vulnerable Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system."
