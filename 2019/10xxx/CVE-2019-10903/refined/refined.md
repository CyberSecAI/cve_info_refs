Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10903:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing boundary check within the DCERPC SPOOLSS dissector of Wireshark. Specifically, the `print_hex_data_buffer` function was susceptible to a heap out-of-bounds read due to this oversight.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
*   Lack of proper boundary checks while handling data in the DCERPC SPOOLSS dissector.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   A successful exploit could lead to a crash of the Wireshark application. This is a denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerability.
*   Other unspecified impacts are mentioned in some advisories, although the exact nature is not detailed.
*   The vulnerability could be triggered either by injecting a malformed packet onto a network or by convincing a user to open a malformed packet trace file.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** A remote attacker could send specially crafted packets containing malformed SPOOLSS data to a vulnerable Wireshark instance that is actively capturing network traffic.
*   **Local:** A local attacker could create a malformed capture file and convince a user to open it in Wireshark.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malformed DCERPC SPOOLSS data packets into network traffic, or have a way to trick the target into opening a malicious capture file.
*   No authentication is required to trigger this vulnerability.
*   The attacker does not require any specific privileges.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Wireshark versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.13, 2.6.0 to 2.6.7, and 3.0.0.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Wireshark versions 2.4.14, 2.6.8, and 3.0.1 by adding a boundary check to `epan/dissectors/packet-dcerpc-spoolss.c`.
*   This CVE is also tracked under WNPA-sec-2019-18.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk.
