Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The EnterpriseDB Windows installer for PostgreSQL writes the superuser password to a temporary file in the installation directory during the database setup process. This file is created, the database is initialized, and then the file is deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Storage:** The installer creates a temporary file containing sensitive information (the superuser password) in a location where local users can potentially access it.
*   **Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Vulnerability:** There is a brief window of time between the creation and deletion of the temporary file during which a local attacker can read the superuser password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Compromise:** A local attacker can gain full control of the PostgreSQL database by obtaining the superuser password.
*   **Data Breach/Loss:** Once compromised, an attacker can access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the PostgreSQL server is being installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the Windows system where the vulnerable installer is being used.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to act within the brief time window while the temporary file containing the password exists.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects the EnterpriseDB Windows installer for PostgreSQL versions 9.4 to 11.
*   The issue was fixed in PostgreSQL versions 11.5, 10.10, 9.6.15, 9.5.19, and 9.4.24.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 6.7 with vector AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H which means:
    *   **AV:L (Local):** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have physical or logical access to the system.
    *   **AC:H (High):** The attack requires specialized access conditions, like winning a race condition.
    *   **PR:L (Low):** The attacker needs to have low privileges on the system.
    *   **UI:R (Required):** The attacker needs to trick the user into performing an action.
    *   **S:U (Unchanged):** The vulnerability affects only the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H (High):** There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:H (High):** There is a high impact on integrity.
    *   **A:H (High):** There is a high impact on availability.
