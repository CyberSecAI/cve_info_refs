| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1733874#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-07-29 05:52:58 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernels bluetooth implementation of UART. A local attacker with write permissions to the bluetooth device can cause a system crash by issuing a specially crafted ioctl function call.  Terminal control operations set on this device node will end up attempting to jump to the null (0x0) page for instruction execution. The kernel code can attempt to execute code in a worker-thread context which does not have the null page mapped.  At this time it is understood to be a local denial of service and no privilege escalation is available.   Upstream submission: [https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190725120909.31235-1-vdronov@redhat.com/T/#u](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-bluetooth/20190725120909.31235-1-vdronov%40redhat.com/T/#u)  Oss-security discussion: <https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/07/25/1>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1733874#c1)  Wade Mealing    2019-07-30 04:13:47 UTC  ``` Note:  You must have bluetooth hardware in the system to be affected by this flaw (systems using the kernel modules hci_ath,hci_bcm, hci_intel, hci_mrvl, hci_qca) The modules can be unloaded and blacklisted to prevent a local attacker from exploiting this issue.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1733874#c5)  Wade Mealing    2019-07-30 04:22:11 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1734242](show_bug.cgi?id=1734242 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-10207 kernel: null-pointer dereference in hci_uart_set_flow_control [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1733874#c7)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 20:35:46 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3309 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3309](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3309)   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1733874#c8)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-11-05 21:06:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:3517 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:3517](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A3517)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1733874#c9)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-11-06 00:53:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
