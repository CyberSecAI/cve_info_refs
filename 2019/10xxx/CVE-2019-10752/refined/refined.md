{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sequelize.json()` helper function in the sequelize package does not properly escape values when formatting subpaths for JSON queries in MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite databases.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious input within the `sequelize.json()` function's path parameter, an attacker can inject SQL code into the generated query.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker must have the ability to influence the `sequelize.json()` function's path argument, which typically is derived from user input or other controllable sources. No privileges required"

  "details": "The vulnerability lies within the `query-generator.js` files for the affected databases. The fix involves modifying how subpaths are handled within the `sequelize.json()` function, particularly when processing user-supplied data. The vulnerability is triggered when using `sequelize.json()` to query JSON columns. Specifically, the path is not properly sanitized or escaped, leading to SQL injection.\n\nThe fix involves ensuring that subpaths are properly escaped and formatted before being included in the SQL query."
