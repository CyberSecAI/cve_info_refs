{
  "CVE-2019-10356": {
    "Description": "Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through crafted subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions. This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.",
    "Root cause": "The Script Security Plugin did not properly sanitize subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Sandbox bypass",
      "Arbitrary code execution"
    ],
    "Impact": "Attackers could execute arbitrary code within the Jenkins master JVM, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or denial of service.",
     "Attack vector": "By specifying crafted subexpressions in sandboxed scripts.",
    "Attacker capabilities": "Ability to specify sandboxed scripts and Overall/Read access permissions."
