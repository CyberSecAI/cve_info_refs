- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application searches for resources using an untrusted search path. This means the application may load and execute malicious DLL files located outside of its intended directories.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Untrusted Search Path (CWE-426). The application does not properly validate the location of resources it attempts to load.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the application.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could place a malicious DLL file in a directory that the vulnerable application searches when loading resources.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to place a malicious DLL in a location where the application will attempt to load it. A low skill level is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker requires local access to the system, this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.
