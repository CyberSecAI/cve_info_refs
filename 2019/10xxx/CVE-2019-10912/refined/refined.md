```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The `unserialize()` function in PHP could be exploited with malicious payloads when processing user-controlled input, triggering file deletions or echoing raw output via destructors with side effects in specific classes.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unsafe deserialization, code injection, arbitrary file deletion.
- Impact of exploitation: Arbitrary file deletion, potentially leading to denial of service.
- Attack vectors: Exploiting the `unserialize()` function with crafted payloads from user-controlled input.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to supply the unserialize function with malicious data.
