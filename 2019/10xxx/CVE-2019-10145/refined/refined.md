Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of seccomp filtering for processes spawned using `rkt enter`. Specifically, when a user executes `rkt enter` to access a running container, the processes within that container do not have seccomp filtering applied during stage 2, which is the actual runtime environment for applications.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing seccomp filtering:**  The core issue is the absence of seccomp filtering for processes started with `rkt enter`. This is a critical security mechanism that restricts the system calls a process can make, limiting its ability to interact with the host system.
*   **Bypass of container isolation:** By not applying seccomp filters, the isolation of the container is compromised.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Host resource access:** A compromised container can exploit this lack of filtering to access host resources, potentially leading to privilege escalation or complete system compromise.
*   **Security breach:** A compromised container could bypass isolation mechanisms, impacting the security of the overall system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`rkt enter` command:** The attack vector is specifically related to using the `rkt enter` command to access a container.
*   **Compromised container:**  An attacker would first need to have compromised a container. Then, using `rkt enter`, they can bypass the expected security restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to compromise a container:** The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious process within a container managed by rkt.
*   **Access to `rkt enter`:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `rkt enter` command, likely requiring some level of access to the host or the rkt service.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Acknowledgement:** The vulnerability was discovered by Yuval Avrahami of Twistlock.
*   **External Reference:** Twistlock published a blog post about this vulnerability and two other related CVEs affecting rkt: `<https://www.twistlock.com/labs-blog/breaking-out-of-coresos-rkt-3-new-cves/>`
*   **Red Hat's view:** Red Hat notes that this issue is in a community-supported product and not a commercially supported one. They directed users to the dependent bugs for the status of the individual community products.

In summary, CVE-2019-10145 highlights a critical flaw in how `rkt enter` handles seccomp filtering, allowing attackers to potentially break out of containers and access host resources.
