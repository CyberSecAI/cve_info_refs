Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10910:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that service IDs, which could be derived from unfiltered user input, were not properly validated or escaped within the Symfony Dependency Injection component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** Service IDs were not checked for potentially malicious characters.
- **Improper Escaping:** Service IDs were not correctly escaped when being dumped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting malicious service IDs, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **SQL Injection:** Although not explicitly stated in the provided descriptions, the Synology advisory suggests that SQL Injection was a potential impact
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability can lead to the execution of arbitrary code, posing a significant security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious code through user-controlled input that is used to construct service IDs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a mechanism to inject their malicious input into the system, particularly where service IDs are constructed.
- No authentication is required as per the CVSS vector, however, user interaction may or may not be required to trigger the vulnerability.

**More Details than the CVE description:**
- The provided content offers more specifics than a basic CVE description, detailing how the lack of validation and escaping on service IDs could lead to code execution, not only SQL injection.
- The content specifies the vulnerable versions of Symfony, and indicates the specific fix applied.
- The provided patch link also allows more visibility into the vulnerability.
- The Synology advisory also suggests that SQL Injection is a possibility.
