{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `taffy` library sets an internal index for each data item in its database. This index can be forged by adding specific properties to user-provided input, causing the library to bypass query conditions and return the indexed data directly. The internal index format is easily guessable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Internal property tampering",
      "Lack of input validation or sanitization on query parameters",
      "Predictable internal index format",
      "Direct access to database entries by index without proper authorization checks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can access any data item within the database, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information and an SQL Injection exploit.",
     "attack_vectors": [
       "By crafting specific query parameters to include the forged internal index, the attacker can bypass query conditions and directly retrieve data.",
      "The easily guessable format of the internal index allows an attacker to potentially access arbitrary data items by manipulating the index value within a crafted query."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide or influence the query parameters used when accessing the `taffy` database.",
    "additional_details": "The `taffy` package has been deprecated and its successor `taffydb` also has the same vulnerability and is not actively maintained. The vulnerability allows for SQL Injection attacks. CVSS score is 7.5 (High)."
