Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-10415:

**CVE-2019-10415**

*   **Vulnerable Plugin:** Violation Comments to GitLab Plugin
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin stored API tokens unencrypted.
*   **Weakness:** Sensitive information (API tokens) were stored in plain text within the plugin's configuration files. Specifically, both job-level (`config.xml`) and global configuration (`org.jenkinsci.plugins.jvctgl.ViolationsToGitLabGlobalConfiguration.xml`) files on the Jenkins controller were affected.
*   **Impact:** Attackers with "Extended Read" permission, or access to the Jenkins controller's filesystem, could read the unencrypted API tokens. This could lead to unauthorized access to the associated GitLab resources.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can obtain the sensitive API tokens by either:
    *   Having "Extended Read" access to the Jenkins configuration files.
    *   Gaining direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs either:
    *   "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins.
    *   Access to the file system of the Jenkins controller.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that existing jobs need to have their configuration saved for existing plain text credentials to be overwritten.
*   This vulnerability is related to the storage of global API tokens. The advisory mentions another related CVE, CVE-2019-10416, which covers the storage of job-specific passwords within the same plugin.
