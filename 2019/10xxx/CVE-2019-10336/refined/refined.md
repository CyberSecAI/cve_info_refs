Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10336:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The configuration forms within various post-build steps of the CloudBees CD Plugin (formerly ElectricFlow Plugin) were vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The plugin was not properly sanitizing/escaping user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the configuration forms.
- This could lead to malicious actions being performed in the context of the user's session, such as:
    - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker must be able to control the output of connected ElectricFlow servers' APIs.
- By manipulating the API responses, an attacker could inject malicious code into configuration forms rendered in the Jenkins UI.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the affected configuration forms in the Jenkins UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to control API responses from connected ElectricFlow servers. This could potentially involve:
  - Compromising an ElectricFlow server.
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks.
  - Exploiting vulnerabilities in the ElectricFlow server's API.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by preventing the plugin from interpreting HTML/JavaScript in responses from ElectricFlow server APIs on job configuration forms.
- This vulnerability is specific to the CloudBees CD Plugin (formerly ElectricFlow Plugin) and was fixed in version 1.1.7.
