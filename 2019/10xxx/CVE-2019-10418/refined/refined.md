Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10418:

**CVE-2019-10418**

*   **Root Cause:** The Kubernetes Pipeline - Arquillian Steps Plugin defines a custom list of pre-approved signatures for scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox. This custom list includes methods that can be used to bypass the Script Security sandbox.

*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Script Security Bypass:** The plugin's custom whitelist of pre-approved signatures allows access to methods that can circumvent the Script Security sandbox. This means that scripts that should be restricted by the sandbox can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Insufficient Sandboxing:** The plugin's approach to sandboxing is insufficient, creating an avenue for bypassing intended restrictions.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins instance. This could lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins server and potentially the systems it manages, including:
    *   Data theft
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of service
    *   Privilege escalation

*  **Attack vectors:**
    * By injecting malicious script code into Jenkins pipelines that use the vulnerable plugin.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An attacker needs to be able to create or modify Jenkins pipeline jobs.
    *   No special network position is needed

**Additional Notes**
*   The advisory states that there is "no fix" available as of the publication date.
*   This vulnerability is related to SECURITY-920 (2)
*   The severity is rated as **High** with a CVSS score of AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
