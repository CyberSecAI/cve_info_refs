Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input validation in the `/system-info/health` endpoint of the Apollo configuration system. The `host` parameter, which is taken directly from user input, is used to construct a URL for an HTTP request using `RestTemplate.getForObject` without any checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF. The application makes an HTTP request to a URL controlled (at least partially) by user input. This allows an attacker to force the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Internal Network Scanning:** An attacker can use the SSRF vulnerability to scan internal networks by sending requests to internal IP addresses and ports, identifying open services or internal resources.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially access sensitive information from internal servers that are not meant to be publicly accessible.
- **Arbitrary Request Execution:** The attacker could potentially make the server interact with other systems on the internal network, leading to further compromises. This is seen with the provided example of hitting a local PHP service with command execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By manipulating the `host` parameter of the `/system-info/health` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/system-info/health` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to know that the `/system-info/health` is vulnerable.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed through practical examples, such as internal network probing and execution of arbitrary code on an internal php server.
- The issue is present because the `RestTemplate.getForObject` is directly taking user input without any validation.
- The attacker can bypass the `/health` path that is hardcoded in the URL by using URL encoding, such as `%23`.
