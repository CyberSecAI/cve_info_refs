Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10363:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Configuration as Code plugin did not reliably detect which values in the exported YAML file need to be considered sensitive (e.g., credentials and other secrets). This is because plugins could use the `Secret` type to store credentials encrypted on disk without exposing the `Secret` type in their Java API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Sensitive Data Handling:** The plugin failed to identify and export secrets in their encrypted form.
- **Insufficient Data Sanitization:** The plugin lacked the ability to correctly identify fields requiring encryption during export.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Credentials and other secrets could be exported in plain text, exposing them to unauthorized users who have access to the exported YAML configuration file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with high privileges (Overall/Administer) could export the Jenkins configuration using the plugin. The exported configuration would include secrets in plaintext if the plugin failed to detect them as sensitive. An attacker with access to the exported configuration would be able to extract these secrets.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Administer permission to export the Jenkins configuration.
