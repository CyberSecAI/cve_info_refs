Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10284:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Diawi Upload Plugin stores the Diawi API access token in plain text within the job's `config.xml` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The API token is stored without encryption, making it easily accessible.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system or with "Extended Read" permissions on the job configuration can obtain the Diawi API token.
- **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker could potentially use this token to upload, manage or modify applications on the Diawi service, leading to supply chain and reputational damage.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker gaining access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
- **Extended Read Permission:** An attacker with "Extended Read" permission for the job configurations within Jenkins.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have either:
    - Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
    - "Extended Read" permissions to the job configurations in Jenkins.
