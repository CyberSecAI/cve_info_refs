An stored XSS when adding a new token in TPS's web page Activity tab due to an improper sanitization of the token id input.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-06-11 14:46:41 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Pritam Singh (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c9)  Cedric Buissart    2020-02-05 08:48:13 UTC  ``` Created pki-core tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1798388](show_bug.cgi?id=1798388 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-10178 pki-core: stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) in the pki-tps web Activity tab [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c10)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2020-02-07 06:27:44 UTC  ``` Do you know if this was reported upstream and there is an upstream fix?   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c11)  Yogendra Jog    2020-02-07 13:39:28 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #10](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c10): > Do you know if this was reported upstream and there is an upstream fix?

However, the security consequences are very limited.  e.g. : Thanks to the webUI using client side TLS authentication, stealing a cookie will not be of much use to the attacker.  At the moment, the only concerns are defacing and minor information disclosure (user information from the victim, such as name, email and roles, which the attacker can probably have access to via other means given the privilege requirements for storing the XSS in the first place).  If/when there is a fix upstream, it will be posted on this bug tracker.  I hope this helps!   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-22 08:08:50 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 9.7  Via RHSA-2021:0947 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0947](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0947)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-03-22 09:03:47 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Certificate System 9.4 EUS  Via RHSA-2021:0948 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:0948](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A0948)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1719042#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-03-23 17:35:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

The TPSProfileService has been modified to validate the
profile ID and profile property names received via REST API.

The TPS UI has been modified to validate profile ID and
profile property names before they are sent to the server.

The TableItem.renderColumn() has been modified to escape
the value already stored in the database before displaying
it in the UI.
