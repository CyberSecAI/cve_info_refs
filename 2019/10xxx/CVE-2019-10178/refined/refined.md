  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Improper sanitization of the token ID input in the Token Processing Service (TPS) web Activity tab.",

      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker could trick an authenticated victim into creating a specially crafted activity, which would execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed in a browser. This could lead to minor information disclosure (user information like name, email, and roles) or defacement.",

      "An attacker crafts a malicious token ID containing JavaScript code.",
      "An authenticated user adds this specially crafted token ID through the TPS web interface, which stores it.",
       "When a user views the 'Activity' tab in the TPS web page, the stored malicious JavaScript is executed in their browser."

    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to make a request that will be stored and viewed by another user.",
