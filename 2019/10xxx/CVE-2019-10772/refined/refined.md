Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10772

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the mishandling of the `xlink` namespace within the `enshrined/svg-sanitize` library. Specifically, the sanitizer fails to properly sanitize the `xlink:href` attribute in SVG files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sanitizer Bypass:** The primary weakness is that the sanitizer can be bypassed using the `xlink:href` attribute. This allows for the injection of malicious code, specifically Javascript.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The bypass enables a Cross-Site Scripting attack, a type of injection that allows malicious scripts to be injected into trusted websites.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable application.
- **Cookie Theft:** The most prominent use of XSS is to steal cookies and hijack user sessions.
- **Information Exposure:** XSS exploits can be used to expose sensitive information.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers might gain access to privileged services and functionalities.
- **Malware Delivery:** XSS can be used to deliver malware.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious SVG Uploads/Inclusion:** An attacker could upload a malicious SVG file, or trick a user to load/view a malicious SVG file, which bypasses the sanitizer and executes the injected JavaScript. This is likely to be a Stored or Reflected XSS.
- The provided PoC shows the injection via the `xlink:href` attribute within an SVG file which is then processed by the vulnerable library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to introduce a malicious SVG file:** The attacker needs to be able to introduce the malicious SVG data to be processed by the vulnerable library which then executes the malicious JavaScript.
- **No special privileges required**: The attacker does not need any special access to carry out the attack.
- **No user interaction required**: The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in versions of `enshrined/svg-sanitize` prior to 0.13.1.
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-79, which is related to Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting').
- Snyk provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability.
- Snyk has a CVSS score of 7.5 (High) for the vulnerability, while NVD has a CVSS score of 6.1 (Medium).
- The attack vector is network-based, meaning it can be exploited remotely.
- The exploit is considered low complexity and requires no privileges.
