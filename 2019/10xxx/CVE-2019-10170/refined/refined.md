Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10170:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the Keycloak admin console's realm management interface allows a script to be set via a policy.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The Keycloak admin console lacks sufficient input validation or sanitization, allowing for arbitrary script insertion within realm management policies.
- The application does not properly restrict execution of scripts defined through the UI

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with authenticated user and realm management permissions can configure a malicious script.
- This script will be triggered, executing arbitrary code with the permissions of the application user. This could lead to a full compromise of the application and its underlying infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the Keycloak admin console.
- The attacker requires realm management permissions.
- The attacker can then navigate to the realm management policy configuration page and inject malicious code as part of a script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access to the Keycloak admin console with realm management privileges is required.

**Additional details:**
- The bug report mentions the vulnerability was fixed in Keycloak version 8.0.0.
- The vulnerability is described as allowing "script execution via realm management policy trigger".
- The "Fixed In Version" is explicitly noted as `keycloak 8.0.0`.
