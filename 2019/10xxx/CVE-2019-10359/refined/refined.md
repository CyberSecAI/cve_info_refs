Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10359:

**CVE Description:**
The provided content indicates that CVE-2019-10359 relates to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Maven Release Plug-in Plugin.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not enforce the use of the POST method for requests sent to the endpoint responsible for initiating the release process. This lack of enforcement allowed attackers to trigger release processes through CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- CSRF vulnerability. The plugin lacked proper validation to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could perform releases without the user's consent by exploiting the lack of POST method enforcement.
- This would lead to unauthorized code deployments or modifications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious link or web page that, when visited by an authenticated Jenkins user, would send a request to the vulnerable endpoint. The request would initiate a release process on behalf of the user.
- The attack is triggered when a victim is logged in to Jenkins and browses to a malicious page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any specific privileges on the Jenkins server.
- The attacker requires the victim user to be logged in to the Jenkins server and trigger the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed by requiring that requests to initiate the release process be sent via POST.
- The vulnerability is present in versions 0.14.0 and earlier of the Maven Release Plug-in Plugin.
