CVE-2019-10439: Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin

- Vulnerability: The CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin did not correctly check permissions when providing a list of applicable credential IDs.
- Root cause: Incorrect permission check.
- Attack vector: Any user with Overall/Read permission could obtain a list of valid credential IDs.
- Impact: Sensitive information disclosure. The exposed credential IDs could be used in other attacks to capture the credentials.
