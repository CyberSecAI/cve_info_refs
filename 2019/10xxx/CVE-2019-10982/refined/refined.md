Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10982:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of user input validation when processing project files. Specifically, the application copies data from these files onto the heap without proper size checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122):**  The primary vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow. This occurs because the application doesn't validate the size of data being read from project files before copying it to the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to run arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Information Disclosure:** While not the primary impact, a heap-based buffer overflow can potentially leak sensitive data.
- **Application Crash:**  Exploitation can also crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Project Files:** The attack vector involves crafting malicious project files that, when processed by the vulnerable software, trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Skill Level:** The advisory mentions that the exploit is of low skill level.
- **Remote Exploitability:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **User Interaction:**  User interaction is needed in order to open the malicious project file.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory also mentions a related **out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CVE-2019-10992)** in the same software due to similar lack of user input validation when processing project files, leading to potential information disclosure.
- The affected software is Delta Industrial Automation CNCSoft ScreenEditor versions 1.00.89 and prior.
- The vulnerability was reported by Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson) working with Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Mitigation includes updating to the latest version of ScreenEditor, Version 1.00.94 and restricting the application to trusted files.
- There are no known public exploits specifically targeting these vulnerabilities.
