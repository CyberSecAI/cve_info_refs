Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10365:

**CVE-2019-10365**

*   **Root Cause:** The Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin created a temporary file named `.kubeâ€¦config` within the project workspace. This file contained a temporary access token.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The plugin created a temporary file containing sensitive information (a temporary access token) in a location accessible to users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers could gain access to the temporary access token by accessing the file via workspace browsers, or if the file was accidentally archived. This token could then be used to access the Kubernetes Engine.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could access the temporary file containing the token through the Jenkins workspace browser or via an archived project workspace.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have at least Overall/Read access to Jenkins, which is needed to browse workspaces.

**Summary:**
The Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin was vulnerable to token disclosure due to storing a temporary access token in a user-accessible location, specifically the project workspace. This allowed attackers with workspace access to retrieve the token. The vulnerability was addressed by moving the temporary file creation to a location outside the regular project workspace.
