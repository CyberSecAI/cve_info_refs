**1. Verification:**

The content directly relates to CVE-2019-10243, as indicated by the bug report title: "Jetty version reported in Server Reply" and the alias assigned to the bug.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Eclipse Kura (versions up to 4.0.0) exposes the version of the underlying Jetty web server in its HTTP responses.
*   **Weakness:** Information Exposure. Revealing the server version provides attackers with valuable information about potential vulnerabilities and exploits that may be applicable.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can use the exposed Jetty version information to specifically craft attacks targeting known vulnerabilities of that particular version of Jetty. This increases the likelihood of successful exploitation.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attack vector is through standard HTTP requests to the Kura web server. The attacker inspects the server's responses to identify the Jetty version.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker only needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Kura web server. No authentication or special privileges are required to obtain the version information.
*   **Affected Component:** The UI web server component of Eclipse Kura.
*   **Resolution:** The issue was resolved in Kura version 4.1.0.

**3. Additional details**

* CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor might be a more appropriate CWE.
