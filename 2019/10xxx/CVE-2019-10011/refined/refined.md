Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The presence of an unprotected page `AddTestUsers.aspx` on Jenzabar JICS portals. This page allows unauthenticated users to create new portal accounts.
*   The newly created accounts are assigned a hardcoded default password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Account Creation:** The `AddTestUsers.aspx` page lacks authentication, allowing anyone to create new accounts on the portal.
*   **Hardcoded Default Password:** All newly created accounts share the same easily guessable password ("1234").
*  **Exposed Moxman file browser:** The newly created accounts are also able to access and expose the moxman file browser.
*   **Web Shell Vulnerability:** When combined with a previously disclosed web shell vulnerability, this issue allows privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Account Creation:** Attackers can create numerous accounts.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Combined with other vulnerabilities (specifically, a previously disclosed web shell vulnerability), attackers can achieve root/admin privileges on the portal server.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** With access, attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data on all university constituents.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** The ability to create accounts can be leveraged to send out phishing emails from what appears to be an internal source, increasing legitimacy.
*   **Access to Moxman file browser**: The new accounts are able to access and expose the moxman file browser through the MCE boxes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to Unprotected Page:** Attackers can directly access the `https://my.domain.edu/ICS/StaticPages/AddTestUsers.aspx` URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected Jenzabar JICS portal, since this is an unauthenticated vulnerability, it's likely the attacker can be anywhere on the internet.
*   **Basic HTTP knowledge**:  Knowledge to navigate to the vulnerable endpoint and fill out the provided form.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in all unpatched versions of Jenzabar JICS.
*   The vendor has released patches, but the version number might not change after patching.
*   The author hypothesizes that `AddTestUsers.aspx` is a leftover from development and was not meant to be accessible in production.
