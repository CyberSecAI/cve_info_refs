**Detail**

* CVE-2019-10909

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 6.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
  + In Symfony before 2.7.51, 2.8.x before 2.8.50, 3.x before 3.4.26, 4.x before 4.1.12, and 4.2.x before 4.2.7, validation messages are not escaped, which can lead to XSS when user input is included. This is related to symfony/framework-bundle.
* CVE-2019-10910

  + Severity: Important
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 7.3
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)
  + In Symfony before 2.7.51, 2.8.x before 2.8.50, 3.x before 3.4.26, 4.x before 4.1.12, and 4.2.x before 4.2.7, when service ids allow user input, this could allow for SQL Injection and remote code execution. This is related to symfony/dependency-injection.
* CVE-2019-10911

  + Severity: Important
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 7.5
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + In Symfony before 2.7.51, 2.8.x before 2.8.50, 3.x before 3.4.26, 4.x before 4.1.12, and 4.2.x before 4.2.7, a vulnerability would allow an attacker to authenticate as a privileged user on sites with user registration and remember me login functionality enabled. This is related to symfony/security.
* CVE-2019-11358

  + Severity: Moderate
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 6.1
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
  + jQuery before 3.4.0, as used in Drupal, Backdrop CMS, and other products, mishandles jQuery.extend(true, {}, ...) because of Object.prototype pollution. If an unsanitized source object contained an enumerable **proto** property, it could extend the native Object.prototype.

Yeah but worth mentioning imo. Logging out thousands of users might cost a lot

One remark regarding this (a bit too late perhaps);

I would like this a little bit shorter for readability/redundancy/etc., sth like that:

`return hash_hmac('sha256', implode(self::COOKIE_DELIMITER, func_get_args()), $this->getSecret());`

Any point to opening a follow-up issue for this?

[@stefanospetrakis](https://github.com/stefanospetrakis) this code is less explicit about what gets included in the hash exactly, due to using `func_get_args` instead of the actual arguments. So to me, this actually makes it less readable.

Sorry, something went wrong.

[@stof](https://github.com/stof) Fair enough, how about the following:

`implode(self::COOKIE_DELIMITER, [$class, $username, $expires, $password])`

[Fabien Potencier](https://connect.symfony.com/api/alternates/4aed4f5d-e0cb-4320-902f-885fddaa7d15)

## Affected versions

Symfony 2.7.0 to 2.7.50, 2.8.0 to 2.8.49, 3.4.0 to 3.4.25, 4.1.0 to 4.1.11 and 4.2.0 to 4.2.6 versions of Symfony Security component are affected by this security issue.

The issue has been fixed in Symfony 2.7.51, 2.8.50, 3.4.26, 4.1.12 and 4.2.7.

Note that no fixes are provided for Symfony 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.0 as they are not maintained anymore.

## Description

This fixes situations where part of an expiry time in a cookie could be considered part of the username, or part of the username could be considered part of the expiry time. An attacker could modify the remember me cookie and authenticate as a different user. This attack is only possible if remember me functionality is enabled and the two users share a password hash or the password hashes (e.g. UserInterface::getPassword()) are null for all users (which is valid if passwords are checked by an external system, e.g. an SSO).

## Resolution

We now separate the various components (username, expires, password) of the cookie hash with colons.

The patch for this issue is available [here](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/a29ce2817cf43bb1850cf6af114004ac26c7a081) for branch 3.4.

## Credits

I would like to thank Jon Cave for reporting and Pascal Borreli & Michael Cullum for fixing the issue.
