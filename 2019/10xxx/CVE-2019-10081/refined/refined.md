Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-10081:

**CVE-2019-10081**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the HTTP/2 implementation of the Apache HTTP server. Specifically, it's triggered by "very early" HTTP/2 PUSHes, often configured using the `H2PushResource` directive. These early pushes cause an overwrite of memory within the pushing request's pool.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** The core issue is memory corruption resulting from writing data to an incorrect memory location within a request's memory pool.
    *   **HTTP/2 PUSH:** The use of HTTP/2 PUSH, specifically the handling of configured push link header values, introduces the possibility of a memory overwrite.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Crashes:** The primary impact is the server crashing due to the memory corruption. This crash can result in a denial of service.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By triggering these crashes, an attacker can effectively cause a denial of service by disrupting the server's availability.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP/2 Requests:** The attack vector is through crafted HTTP/2 requests that trigger the vulnerable PUSH functionality.
    *   **Network-based:** This is a network-based attack, meaning an attacker can initiate the exploit remotely.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the server.
    *   **Understanding of HTTP/2:** The attacker needs to be aware of the HTTP/2 PUSH mechanism and the vulnerable configurations (`H2PushResource`).
    *   **No Authentication:**  The vulnerability can be triggered without any authentication.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability does not involve client-supplied data directly causing the overwrite. Instead, it's the configured push link header values that are copied into the wrong location.
*   The vulnerability is specific to HTTP/2 and is triggered by the push functionality.
*   The provided text also notes the related CVE-2019-10082, which describes a read-after-free issue in HTTP/2 session handling.

The information in the provided documents aligns with and elaborates on the official CVE description. Specifically, the documents detail the following:

*   **Specific vulnerable versions:** The Suse pages list the vulnerable versions as 2.4.20 through 2.4.39.
*  **Memory Pool corruption:** It explains how the memory corruption occurs within the pushing requestâ€™s pool, not with data supplied by the client.
*  **How the push is configured** The vulnerability involves PUSHes configured using the "H2PushResource".
*   **Real-world impact:** The text explains the impact of the crash and potential DoS, as well as the necessary steps to resolve the issues in various platforms.

The information provided is consistent with a memory corruption vulnerability in the handling of HTTP/2 push requests, leading to crashes and potential DoS.
