Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10346:

**Vulnerability:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The Embeddable Build Status Plugin did not sanitize arguments provided in the query string.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin failed to properly sanitize user-supplied data within the query string. This allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a victim's browser when they visit a crafted URL. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could steal the user's session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the application.
    *   **Data Theft:** The attacker could steal sensitive information displayed on the page.
    *   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Redirection:** The attacker can redirect the user to a malicious site.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the malicious script in the query parameters and tricks the victim into clicking it. The victim would typically be an authenticated Jenkins user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **No prior authentication is required**,  an attacker can craft a malicious URL and trick any user into visiting the crafted URL.
*   **Social engineering** to entice a user to click the malicious link.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is specific to the Embeddable Build Status Plugin.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is implemented by sanitizing arguments in the query string.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is Medium, indicating a significant risk level.
