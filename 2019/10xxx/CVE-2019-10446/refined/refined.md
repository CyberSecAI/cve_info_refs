The provided content is related to CVE-2019-10446.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cadence vManager Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The plugin disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation globally and unconditionally, making all connections insecure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could perform man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept or modify data transmitted between the Jenkins controller and the vManager service. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive data or allow the attacker to inject malicious data.

**Attack vectors:**
A network attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack could exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept the communication between the Jenkins controller and the vManager service.
