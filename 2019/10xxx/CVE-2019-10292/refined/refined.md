The provided content contains vulnerability information for multiple CVEs, including CVE-2019-10292.

Here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-10292:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The `kmap-jenkins` plugin lacks a permission check in its form validation method.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** Allows unauthorized users to trigger actions.
*   **CSRF:** Enables attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
*   **SSRF:** The missing permission check and lack of POST validation in the form validation method in kmap-jenkins allows users with Overall/Read permissions to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can force a Jenkins user's browser to initiate a connection to an arbitrary server by tricking them into submitting a crafted request (CSRF).
*   An attacker with Overall/Read permissions can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials, resulting in a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** Attacker crafts a malicious link or webpage that, when visited by an authenticated Jenkins user, will trigger the vulnerable form validation method.
*   **Missing permission check:**  Any user with Overall/Read permission can trigger the vulnerable form validation method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to entice a Jenkins user to visit a malicious link or webpage (CSRF).
*   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability is present in `kmap-jenkins` Plugin versions up to and including 1.6
