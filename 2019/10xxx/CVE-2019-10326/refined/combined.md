## Descriptions

### Persisted XSS vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1373
/
CVE-2019-10325**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages.
This allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Warnings Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings parser names.

### CSRF vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1391
/
CVE-2019-10326**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning counts for future builds.

Warnings Plugin now requires that these requests be sent via POST.

### XML External Entity processing vulnerability in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1409
/
CVE-2019-10327**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-maven`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-maven)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

### Unsafe entry in Script Security list of approved signatures in Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin

**SECURITY-921
/
CVE-2019-10328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-remote-loader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-remote-loader)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom list of pre-approved signatures for Script Security.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe pre-approved entry has been removed.

### InfluxDB Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1403
/
CVE-2019-10329**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`influxdb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/influxdb)**

**Description:**

InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

### Improper handling of untrusted branches in Gitea Plugin

**SECURITY-1046
/
CVE-2019-10330**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitea`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitea)**

**Description:**

Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not be trusted, and the target branchâ€™s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior.
Attackers without commit access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull request content when those are trusted.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Artifactory Plugin allow capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1015 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (missing permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allows users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1015 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10323**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

### CSRF vulnerability in Artifactory Plugin

**SECURITY-1347
/
CVE-2019-10324**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`artifactory`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/artifactory)**

**Description:**

Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is available.

The Jenkins Next Generation Warnings plugin collects compiler warnings or issues reported by static analysis tools and visualizes the results. It has built-in support for more than a hundred [report formats](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/SUPPORTED-FORMATS.md). Among the problems it can detect:

* errors from your compiler (C, C#, Java, etc.)
* warnings from a static analysis tool (CheckStyle, StyleCop, SpotBugs, etc.)
* duplications from a copy-and-paste detector (CPD, Simian, etc.)
* vulnerabilities
* open tasks in comments of your source files

The plugin publishes a report of the issues found in your build, so you can navigate to a summary report from the main build page. From there you can also dive into the details:

* distribution of new, fixed and outstanding issues
* distribution of the issues by severity, category, type, module, or package
* list of all issues including helpful comments from the reporting tool
* annotated source code of the affected files
* trend charts of the issues over time

[![Jenkins Warnings Plug-in](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin@main/doc/images/jenkins.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/doc/images/jenkins.png)

This code of this plugin is also available as a standalone GitHub or GitLab action that runs without Jenkins now:

* [Quality Monitor GitHub Action](https://github.com/uhafner/quality-monitor): action that monitors the quality of projects based on a configurable set of metrics and gives feedback on pull requests (or single commits) in GitHub.
* [GitHub Autograding action](https://github.com/uhafner/autograding-github-action): action that automatically grades student software projects based on a configurable set of metrics and gives feedback on pull requests (or single commits) in GitHub.
* [GitLab Autograding action](https://github.com/uhafner/autograding-gitlab-action): action that automatically grades student software projects based on a configurable set of metrics and gives feedback on merge requests (or single commits) in GitLab.

[![Quality Monitor GitHub Action](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin@main/doc/images/quality-monitor.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/doc/images/quality-monitor.png)

If you are using Git as a source code management system then the warnings plugin will optionally mine the repository in the style of [Code as a Crime Scene](https://www.adamtornhill.com/articles/crimescene/codeascrimescene.htm) (Adam Tornhill, November 2013) to determine statistics of the affected files (i.e. the files with issues):

* commits count
* different authors count
* creation time
* last modification time
* lines of code (from the commit details)
* code churn (changed lines since created)

Additionally, the plugin shows the last person who modified the code that contains an issue (and the last commit ID). In order to use this functionality you need to install the optional [Git Forensics Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/git-forensics-plugin).

If your tool is not yet supported by the warnings plugin you can either define a new Groovy based parser in the user interface or provide a parser within a new small plug-in. If the parser is useful for other teams as well please share it and provide pull requests for the [Warnings Next Generation Plug-in](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/pulls) and the [Analysis Parsers Library](https://github.com/jenkinsci/analysis-model/pulls).

For more details please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/jenkinsci/warnings-ng-plugin/blob/main/doc/Documentation.md) or to an [introductory video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GcEqML8nys).

SECURITY-1373 / CVE-2019-10325
Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings
parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included
HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings
parser names.

SECURITY-1391 / CVE-2019-10326
Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross-
site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning
counts for future builds.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent
via POST.

SECURITY-1409 / CVE-2019-10327
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a
way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary
directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have
Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities
for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request
forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External
Entities in XML documents.

SECURITY-921 / CVE-2019-10328
Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as
Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary
methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.

SECURITY-1403 / CVE-2019-10329
InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

SECURITY-1046 / CVE-2019-10330
Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to
the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not
be trusted, and the target branchâ€™s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit
access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to
Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the
configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull
request content when those are trusted.

SECURITY-1015 (1) / CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (permission check)
Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1015 (2) / CVE-2019-10323
Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1347 / CVE-2019-10324
Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to
trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.
