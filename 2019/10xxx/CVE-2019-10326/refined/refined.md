### Vulnerability Summary:
The Warnings Plugin in Jenkins did not enforce the use of POST requests for the endpoint responsible for resetting warning counts. This oversight resulted in a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability.

### Root Cause:
The plugin failed to mandate POST requests for the reset warning counts endpoint.

### Weakness:
CSRF vulnerability due to missing POST request enforcement.

### Attack Vectors:
An attacker could craft a malicious web page that triggers a request to the vulnerable endpoint when visited by an authenticated user.

### Impact:
An attacker could reset warning counts for future builds.

### Required Capabilities:
The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious web page while they are authenticated to the Jenkins instance.
