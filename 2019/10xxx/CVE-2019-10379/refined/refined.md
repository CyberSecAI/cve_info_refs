Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10379:

**CVE-2019-10379**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Google Cloud Messaging Notification Plugin stores the Google Cloud Messaging API key in plain text within the plugin's global configuration file (`org.jenkinsci.plugins.gcm.im.GcmPublisher.xml`) on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Sensitive information exposure due to storing credentials unencrypted.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller file system can view the plaintext API key, potentially leading to unauthorized access or abuse of Google Cloud Messaging services.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to gain access to the Jenkins controller file system to read the configuration file. This could be achieved through a compromised account, a vulnerable server, or other means of unauthorized access.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires file system access on the Jenkins controller. This access could come from being a legitimate user, a malicious user, or having compromised the server through other means.

**Summary of the vulnerability from the provided text:**

> Google Cloud Messaging Notification Plugin stores an API key unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.gcm.im.GcmPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
