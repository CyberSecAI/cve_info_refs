Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Red Hat Quay stores robot account tokens in plain text in the database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Storage of sensitive credentials (robot account tokens) in plaintext, making them easily accessible if the database is compromised.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with the ability to perform database queries on the Red Hat Quay database can obtain robot account tokens.
- These tokens can be used to read or write container images stored in the registry, effectively compromising the affected robot accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Direct database access. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in database access control, or by compromising a user with database privileges.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to perform database queries on the Red Hat Quay database. This implies a privileged position either via compromised credentials, or through some other vulnerability leading to direct database access.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat Quay 3 via RHSA-2019:4341.
- The issue was discovered by Sean Smith of F5 Networks.
