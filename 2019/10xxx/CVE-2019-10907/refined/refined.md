The provided content is related to the following vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The commit addresses a vulnerability in the remember-me functionality of the Airsonic application. The default Spring Security implementation for remember-me uses a fixed key, making it vulnerable to offline brute-force attacks if an attacker obtains the cookie.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The original implementation used a fixed key for remember-me cookie generation. This allows an attacker to capture the cookie and trivially brute-force the user's password offline.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker who has captured a remember-me cookie can potentially brute-force the user's password offline, gaining unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to capture a valid remember-me cookie from a user's browser. This can be done through various methods, such as network sniffing or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to capture the remember-me cookie.
- The attacker needs to be able to perform offline brute-force attacks.
- No other information is provided about attacker's capabilities

**Mitigation:**
The commit addresses the issue by using a randomly generated key instead of a fixed one to "encrypt" the remember-me cookie value, mitigating the risk of trivial brute-force attacks.
