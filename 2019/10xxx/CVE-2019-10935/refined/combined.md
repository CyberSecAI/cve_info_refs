SUMMARY

The latest update for SIMATIC WinCC ﬁxes a vulnerability in the SIMATIC WinCC DataMonitor web
application of the affected products that allows to upload arbitrary ASPX code.

An attacker has to be authenticated with a valid user account. The vulnerability is only relevant for
scenarios where access via the web interface is feasible for an attacker while access to the directory
structure is not.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products, and recommends that customers update to
the new version. Siemens is preparing further updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures until
patches are available.
