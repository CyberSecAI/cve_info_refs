- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SIMATIC WinCC DataMonitor web application allows uploading arbitrary ASPX code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload, specifically of ASPX files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the WinCC DataMonitor web application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with a valid user account to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability is only relevant if an attacker has web access, but not direct access to the file system.
