SUMMARY

The latest update for TIM 3V-IE family devices and TIM 4R-IE family devices ﬁxes a vulnerability that
could allow an unauthenticated attacker with network access to port 17185/udp to gain full control over
the device.

The devices are only vulnerable if the IP address is conﬁgured to 192.168.1.2.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends that customers update to the
new version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Set the IP of the device to anything other than 192.168.1.2.

• Limit access to port 17185/udp of an affected device (e.g. cell-protection ﬁrewall or corporate

ﬁrewall) to reduce the risk.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10939

The affected versions contain an open debug port that is available under certain speciﬁc conditions.
The vulnerability is only available if the IP address is conﬁgured to 192.168.1.2.

If available, the debug port could be exploited by an attacker with network access to the device. No
user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability. The vulnerability impacts conﬁdentiality, integrity,
and availability of the affected device.

At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known.
