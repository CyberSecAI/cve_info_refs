Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10866:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `get_labels_parameters` function within the `form-maker/admin/models/Submissions_fm.php` file. Specifically, the `asc_or_desc` parameter is vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection:  The application does not sanitize user-supplied input (`asc_or_desc` parameter) before using it in a SQL query, leading to an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries. The provided proof of concept (PoC) demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection by injecting a `sleep(5)` command, which would cause a delay in the server's response.
- This could potentially lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Accessing and extracting sensitive data from the database.
    - Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    - Complete system compromise: In some scenarios, the attacker could potentially gain control of the database server and, consequently, the application and the underlying host.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through an HTTP GET request by crafting a malicious payload in the `asc_or_desc` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the WordPress admin interface and navigate to the "Submissions" section of the "Form Maker" plugin.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify the URL parameters.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, so it's likely that a user with access to the "Submissions" section could exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability exists in Form Maker plugin versions prior to 1.13.3.
- The provided PoC includes the SQL injection payload:
  `,(case+when+(select+sleep(5)+from+wp_formmaker_submits+limit+1)+then+1+else+2+end)+asc+--+`
