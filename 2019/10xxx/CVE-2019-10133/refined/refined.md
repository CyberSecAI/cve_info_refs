Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability exists because the form used to upload cohorts in Moodle contained a redirect field that wasn't restricted to internal URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Open Redirect: The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where an attacker can manipulate a URL to redirect a user to a malicious website.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Phishing: An attacker could craft a malicious link that, when clicked, redirects a user to a fraudulent login page or other malicious content. This could be used to steal user credentials or deliver malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious URL: An attacker crafts a URL that includes the vulnerable redirect parameter pointing to an external malicious site and distributes it to Moodle users.
- Social Engineering: The attacker relies on tricking users into clicking the malicious link, often via email, messaging or other forms of communication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- No special access is required. Any user who can craft a URL and potentially share it with other users can exploit the vulnerability.

**Versions Affected:**
- Moodle versions 3.6 to 3.6.3, 3.5 to 3.5.5, 3.4 to 3.4.8, 3.1 to 3.1.17 and earlier unsupported versions

**Versions Fixed:**
- Moodle 3.7, 3.6.4, 3.5.6, 3.4.9 and 3.1.18

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is considered "minor" in severity/risk.
- The vulnerability was reported by Lindon Wass.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves restricting the redirect parameter to only accept internal URLs
