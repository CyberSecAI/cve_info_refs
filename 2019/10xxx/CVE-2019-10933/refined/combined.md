WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Do not allow Internet access for Spectrum Power UI clients.

• Users should be trained to avoid clicking on unknown links.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build
resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly

recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Spectrum Power™ 3 SCADA applications provide functions required for monitoring, alarming, mea-
suring, calculating, archiving and safe supervisory control based on analog and digital measurements,
accumulator values, and momentaries.

Spectrum Power™ 4 provides basic components for SCADA, communications, and data modeling for
control and monitoring systems. Application suites can be added to optimize network and generation
management for all areas of energy management.

Spectrum Power™ 5 is used for the automation of power supply networks in industry and for gas, water,
district heating, and power supply grids operated by public utilities.

Spectrum Power™ 7 was developed for energy management in power transmission and distribution
systems as well as for controlling railway power supply systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.0
(CVSS v3.0) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10933

The web server could allow Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks if unsuspecting users are tricked into
accessing a malicious link.

User interaction is required for a successful exploitation. The user does not need to be logged into the
web interface in order for the exploitation to succeed.

At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known.
