Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10864:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

*   **Root Cause:**  A stored XSS vulnerability exists in the WP-Statistics plugin.
*   **Weakness:** The article mentions a stored XSS vulnerability within the WP-Statistics plugin. The provided GitHub commit shows a change to `includes/functions/functions.php` that appears to be related to sanitizing the title obtained from a URL. The original code was: `return ( wp_strip_all_tags( $title ) == "" ? false : $title );` and the fix is: `return ( wp_strip_all_tags( $title ) == "" ? false : wp_strip_all_tags( $title ) );`.  This indicates that the `$title` variable, which is obtained from an external URL, was not being properly sanitized before being used in the application. Specifically, the `wp_strip_all_tags` function was only applied to check if the title was empty, but the title itself was returned without sanitization if it wasn't empty.
*   **Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the title of a page.  This malicious code would then be stored in the database and executed whenever a user views the affected page within the WP-Statistics plugin's interface.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker would need to find a way to influence the `$url` variable, so that when the `wp_statistics_get_site_title` function is called, it fetches a malicious title.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to inject malicious input that is used as a URL by the vulnerable function. The attacker would likely need administrator or editor privileges to configure the plugin or post content that uses this function.
