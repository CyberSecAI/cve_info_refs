Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10335:

**Root Cause:**
- The CloudBees CD plugin was not properly escaping user-controlled content when displaying build metadata on Jenkins build pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin failed to sanitize user-provided input before rendering it on the build pages, leading to a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into Jenkins build pages.
- This could potentially allow attackers to:
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
  - Deface the build pages.
  - Redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could inject malicious code via API responses from ElectricFlow.
- A user with Job/Configure permission can introduce the malicious content through plugin configurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers either need "Job/Configure" permission or must control API responses received from ElectricFlow servers to inject malicious content.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the way the CloudBees CD Plugin handles build metadata display.
- The fix involves filtering build metadata through an HTML formatter to only allow basic HTML.
- The fix ensures all builds executed after the security update will properly escape content received from ElectricFlow.
