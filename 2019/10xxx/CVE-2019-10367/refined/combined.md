# Wall Display Master Project

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Reflected XSS vulnerability](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-08-07/#SECURITY-751)

* [Documentation](/jenkinswalldisplay/)
* [Releases](/jenkinswalldisplay/releases/)
* [Issues](/jenkinswalldisplay/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/jenkinswalldisplay/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/jenkinswalldisplay/healthscore/)

A wall display that shows job build progress in a way suitable for
public wall displays. Rendering is performed using javascript based on
REST API calls, so requires no page refreshes.

## **Demo and current development snapshot**

For a live demo and the latest development snapshot
see <http://pelle.io/jenkins-walldisplay/>.

## Usage

Simply click on the 'Wall Display' link in the sidebar of your project.
Configuration may be done globally via the jenkins administration screen
and also via URL parameters (e.g. &theme=boss)

## **Sample Wall Display Tips**

If you have a lot of jobs, try setting filters on your view. The follow
example creates a wall display that only shows interesting builds, i.e.
builds with any type of failure or builds that are currently building /
in the build queue.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

---

SECURITY-1497 / CVE-2019-10367
Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins
system log. Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with
asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure. Configuration as
Code Plugin inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor
argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much
more robust for the purpose of log message masking. This was implemented in
the fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory.

That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the
logger io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator.

SECURITY-1482 / CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)
JClouds Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials
IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in
Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-157 / CVE-2019-10370
Mask Passwords Plugin allows specifying passwords to be provided to builds
in the global Jenkins configuration.

While the passwords are stored encrypted on disk, they are transmitted in
plain text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure
of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

SECURITY-795 / CVE-2019-10371
Gitlab Authentication Plugin does not invalidate the previous session and
create a new one upon successful login. This allows attackers able to
control or obtain another user’s pre-login session ID to impersonate them.

SECURITY-796 / CVE-2019-10372
Gitlab Authentication Plugin records the HTTP Referer header when the
authentication process starts and redirects users to that URL when the user
has finished logging in.

This implements an open redirect, allowing malicious sites to implement a
phishing attack, with users expecting they have just logged in to Jenkins.

SECURITY-879 / CVE-2019-10373
Build Pipeline Plugin does not properly escape variables in views,
resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
users with permission to configure build pipelines.

This vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins releases older than 2.146
or 2.138.2 due to the security hardening implemented in those releases.

SECURITY-142 / CVE-2019-10374
PegDown Formatter Plugin uses the PegDown library to implement support for
rendering Markdown formatted descriptions in Jenkins. It advertises
disabling of HTML to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) as a feature.

PegDown Formatter Plugin does not prevent the use of javascript: scheme in
URLs for links. This results in an XSS vulnerability exploitable by users
able to configure entities with descriptions or similar properties that are
rendered by the configured markup formatter.

SECURITY-569 / CVE-2019-10375
File System SCM Plugin allows users able to configure jobs to read
arbitrary files from the Jenkins master, even if the job is running on an
agent.

SECURITY-751 / CVE-2019-10376
Wall Display Master Project Plugin does not properly escape the customTheme
query parameter, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-1099 / CVE-2019-10377
Avatar Plugin does not implement a permission check for the HTTP URL used
to replace user avatars. This allows any user with Overall/Read permission
to change any other user’s avatar, in addition to their own.

SECURITY-1428 / CVE-2019-10378
TestLink Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration
file hudson.plugins.testlink.TestLinkBuilder.xml on the Jenkins master.
These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the master file
system.

SECURITY-591 / CVE-2019-10379
Google Cloud Messsaging Notification Plugin stores an API key unencrypted
in its global configuration file org.jenkinsci.plugins.gcm.im.GcmPublisher.
xml on the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-922 / CVE-2019-10380
Simple Travis Pipeline Runner Plugin defines a custom whitelist for scripts
protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass
Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code
execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

SECURITY-931 / CVE-2019-10381
Codefresh Integration Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate
validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1376 / CVE-2019-10382
VMware Lab Manager Slaves Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS
certificate validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1430 / CVE-2019-10385
eggPlant Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended
Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1008 / CVE-2019-10386 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10387 (permission check)
XL TestView Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

SECURITY-1053 / CVE-2019-10388 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10389 (permission check)
A missing permission check in a form validation method in Relution
Enterprise Appstore Publisher Plugin allows users with Overall/Read
permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL using
attacker-specified credentials and attacker-specified HTTP proxy
configuration.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

## Descriptions

### Configuration as Code Plugin failed to mask secrets in system log messages

**SECURITY-1497
/
CVE-2019-10367**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.
Configuration as Code Plugin inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.
This was implemented in the [fix for SECURITY-1279 in the 2019-07-31 security advisory](/security/advisory/2019-07-31/#SECURITY-1279).

That fix was incomplete and did not cover a log message written to the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator`.

Configuration as Code Plugin now uses the same secret detection for these log messages.

As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator` to a level that does not include these messages.
Configuration as Code Plugin 1.25 and earlier logs these messages at the `INFO` level, Configuration as Code Plugin 1.26 logs them at `FINE`.
See [the logging documentation](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) for details.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in JClouds Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1482
/
CVE-2019-10368 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10369 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jclouds-jenkins`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jclouds-jenkins)**

**Description:**

JClouds Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.

### Mask Passwords Plugin shows plain text passwords in global configuration form fields

**SECURITY-157
/
