Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10367:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The Configuration as Code plugin was logging changes to the Jenkins system log, but it failed to properly mask secrets (like passwords) in log messages written by the `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator` logger. This is despite a previous fix implemented for similar logging issues.

*   **Weakness:** Incomplete secret masking in log messages.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  Accidental disclosure of sensitive information, such as passwords, within the Jenkins system logs. This could lead to unauthorized access or other security breaches.

*   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker could potentially gain access to these logs and find the secrets if the logging level is not set to be hidden.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker would need access to Jenkins system logs. This could be through direct access to the server, or through access to systems that gather Jenkins logs.

**Additional Information:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involved ensuring that the same secret detection method used for other log messages is also applied to messages from `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.impl.configurators.DataBoundConfigurator`.
*   As a workaround, administrators can set the logging level of the vulnerable logger to a level that doesn't include these messages.
*  The vulnerability was present in Configuration as Code Plugin versions up to and including 1.26. The fix is in version 1.27.
