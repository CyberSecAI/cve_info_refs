## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Docker Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1010
/
CVE-2019-10340 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10341 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`docker-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin)**

**Description:**

Docker Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer or Item/Configure permission, as appropriate.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in Docker Plugin

**SECURITY-1400
/
CVE-2019-10342**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`docker-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/docker-plugin)**

**Description:**

Docker Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires the appropriate permission, typically Overall/Administer or Item/Configure.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability in Embeddable Build Status Plugin

**SECURITY-1419
/
CVE-2019-10346**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`embeddable-build-status`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/embeddable-build-status)**

**Description:**

Embeddable Build Status Plugin did not sanitize arguments provided in the query string, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Arguments are now sanitized.

### mashup-portlets-plugin Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-775
/
CVE-2019-10347**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`mashup-portlets-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/mashup-portlets-plugin)**

**Description:**

mashup-portlets-plugin Plugin stored SonarQube credentials unencrypted on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

mashup-portlets-plugin Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted.

### Gogs Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1438
/
CVE-2019-10348**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gogs-webhook`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gogs-webhook)**

**Description:**

Gogs Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Gogs Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin

**SECURITY-1177
/
CVE-2019-10349**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`depgraph-view`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/depgraph-view)**

**Description:**

Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin does not correctly escape the Display Name value for jobs in Jenkins, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Port Allocator Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1441
/
CVE-2019-10350**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`port-allocator`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/port-allocator)**

**Description:**

Port Allocator Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Caliper CI Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1437
/
CVE-2019-10351**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`caliper-ci`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/caliper-ci)**

**Description:**

Caliper CI Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
