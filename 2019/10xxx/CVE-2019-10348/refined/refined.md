Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Gogs Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials (likely passwords or API keys) in plain text within the job configuration files. This exposes the credentials to unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Disclosure:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system or has "Extended Read" permission can read the `config.xml` files and obtain the stored credentials.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** The disclosed credentials could potentially be used to access the Gogs server or other systems that these credentials provide access to. This can allow further attacks, such as data exfiltration or unauthorized modification of resources.
- **Compromise of build process:** According to the ZDI advisory, an attacker could "leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the build process".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the `config.xml` files to obtain the credentials.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users with "Extended Read" permission within Jenkins can also access the `config.xml` files through Jenkins' interface, which are likely stored in the `JENKINS_HOME` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This may be achieved through various means such as:
  - Compromised accounts on the Jenkins server itself
  - Exploitation of another vulnerability that allows file system access
- **Jenkins User with Extended Read Permissions:** A less privileged attacker who is a Jenkins user with "Extended Read" permissions can obtain the credentials through Jenkins' interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory from jenkins.io clarifies that the affected plugin is the `gogs-webhook` plugin
- The Gogs plugin version 1.0.15 addresses this vulnerability by encrypting the stored credentials.
- The ZDI advisory provides a more specific CVSS score (3.3) that uses the Base Metrics: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N. This indicates a Local attack vector, low complexity, required low privileges for exploitation, no user interaction and low impact on Confidentiality.
