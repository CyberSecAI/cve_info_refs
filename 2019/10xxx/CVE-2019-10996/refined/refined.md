**CVE-2019-10996**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability occurs when a specially crafted, malicious input file is opened by a valid user. This file can cause the program to reference memory after it has been freed.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute code, potentially leading to complete control of the affected system.
