- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by the lack of authentication for the API endpoint `/goform/form2userconfig.cgi`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass, insecure API access control.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can change the system administrator password without any authentication, gaining full access to the router.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable API endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to reach the router's web interface (typically on the local network).
