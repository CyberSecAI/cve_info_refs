#### [CVE-2019-10270] Ultimate Member 2.39 Arbitrary password reset
#### Description ####
An arbitrary password reset issue (Incorrect Access Control) has been discovered in the Ultimate Member plugin 2.39 for WordPress.
It is possible (due to lack of verification and correlation between the reset password link key sent by mail and the user\_id parameter) to reset the password of another user.
We only needs to know the user\_id, which is publicly available, moreover the user\_id parameter is a numerical generated incremental value.
It is possible to modify the passwords for any users or admin WordPress Ultimate Members.
This could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation.
