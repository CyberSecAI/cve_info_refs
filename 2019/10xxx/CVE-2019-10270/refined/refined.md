  "CVE-2019-10270": {
    "Description": "An arbitrary password reset issue was discovered in the Ultimate Member plugin 2.39 for WordPress. It is possible (due to lack of verification and correlation between the reset password key sent by mail and the user_id parameter) to reset the password of another user. One only needs to know the user_id, which is publicly available. One just has to intercept the password modification request and modify user_id. It is possible to modify the passwords for any users or admin WordPress Ultimate Members. This could lead to account compromise and privilege escalation.",
    "Root cause": "Lack of verification and correlation between the reset password key sent by mail and the user_id parameter.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password (CWE-640)",
      "Incorrect Access Control"
    ],
    "Impact": "Account compromise and privilege escalation. Attackers can modify passwords for any user, including administrators.",
    "Attack vectors": "Remote",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the target user's user_id, which is publicly available and can be intercepted in a password reset request. The attacker has to be a user of the website using the ultimate member plugin, request a password reset, then modify the user_id parameter."
