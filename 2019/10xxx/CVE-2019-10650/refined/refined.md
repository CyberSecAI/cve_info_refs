1.  Content relates to CVE-2019-10650.
2.  The content provides useful vulnerability information
    Root cause of vulnerability: Heap-based buffer over-read in the function WriteTIFFImage of coders/tiff.c
    Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Heap-based buffer over-read
    Impact of exploitation: Denial of service or information disclosure
    Attack vectors: Exploiting a crafted image file.
    Required attacker capabilities/position: User interaction is required to open a malicious image file.

Additional Details:
    - The provided information contains details from multiple sources (SUSE, Debian, Github, openSUSE) which all corroborate that the root cause is a heap-based buffer over-read vulnerability in the  WriteTIFFImage function within the coders/tiff.c file of ImageMagick.
    - This issue can lead to denial of service or information disclosure if a crafted image file is processed.
    - Some sources mention that the impact is denial of service, or possibly code execution, but that is not always clear. Most agree that it is a DoS.
    - The vulnerable code is triggered by parsing a specially crafted TIFF image, specifically during the writing of the image, hence WriteTIFFImage
