Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10295:

**CVE-2019-10295**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The `crittercism-dsym` plugin stores credentials (specifically, API keys) unencrypted in job configuration (`config.xml`) files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The primary vulnerability is that the plugin stores API keys in plain text instead of using encryption.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   **Information Disclosure**: Attackers who gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system or have "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins jobs can view these API keys. This could lead to unauthorized access to the services or resources protected by those API keys.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   **File System Access**: Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
    *   **Jenkins UI Access**: Users with "Extended Read" permissions on Jenkins jobs can view the configuration files.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   An attacker needs either:
        *   Direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system, or
        *   "Extended Read" permissions for Jenkins jobs.

**Summary of CVE-2019-10295:**

The `crittercism-dsym` plugin for Jenkins stores API keys in plain text within job configuration files. This makes the API keys accessible to users who can access the controller's file system or have "Extended Read" permissions for the job, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the associated services.

This vulnerability is part of a larger set of security issues disclosed in the Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-04-03.
