Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10887:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in several parameters of the web interface of Salicru UPS devices. Specifically, the `log`, `name`, and `data` parameters in various URLs are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected HTML Injection:** The primary vulnerability is reflected HTML injection. This means that the attacker's malicious HTML code is included in the server's response to the user, which is then rendered by the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML code into the web interface of the UPS device. This can lead to several potential impacts:
    *   **Phishing:**  An attacker could inject a fake login form to steal user credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** The attacker could alter the appearance of the web interface, causing confusion or distrust.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Malicious scripts can be injected that could redirect users to malicious websites or trigger downloads of malware.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Javascript could be injected to steal session cookies.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through specially crafted URLs containing malicious HTML code within the vulnerable parameters (`log`, `name`, and `data`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Salicru UPS web interface to exploit this vulnerability. Default credentials like "admin/admin" or "admin/cs121-snmp" might be used by the attacker to gain initial access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the targeted UPS device's web interface.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable URLs and parameters to craft the malicious payload.

**Technical Details:**

*   The following URLs and parameters are specifically mentioned as being vulnerable:
    *   `/DataLog.csv?log=`
    *   `/AlarmLog.csv?log=`
    *   `/waitlog.cgi?name=`
    *   `/chart.shtml?data=`
    *   `/createlog.cgi?name=`
*   A sample payload is provided: `<h1>HTML Injection</h1>`

**Additional Notes:**

* The github content provides a PoC (Proof of Concept) example.
* The content from exploit-db includes a summary of the vulnerability.
* The affected firmware version is `cs121-SNMP v4.54.82.130611`

This information provides a good understanding of the reflected HTML injection vulnerability present in the Salicru UPS devices and associated with CVE-2019-10887.
