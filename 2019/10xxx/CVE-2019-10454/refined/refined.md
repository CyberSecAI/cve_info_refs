This document describes multiple vulnerabilities, and CVE-2019-10454 is one of them.

**CVE-2019-10454:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Rundeck Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation and also did not require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    *   Missing permission check: Users with Overall/Read access could initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server.
    *   CSRF vulnerability: The form validation method did not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password, potentially capturing or compromising those credentials.
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   An attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
    *   The attacker can exploit the missing permission check by initiating a connection test to a malicious server.
    *   The attacker can use CSRF attacks by tricking a user to send a request to initiate the connection test.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance. The attacker would need to entice a user to visit a malicious URL or craft a malicious request.
