Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability exists due to the improper handling of XML external entities in the `/pingback.axd` endpoint of BlogEngine.NET versions 3.3.7 and earlier. The XML parser does not have the XML resolver set, which allows processing of external entities.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application is vulnerable to XXE injection. It parses XML without disabling external entity processing. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML that references external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive data like configuration files, credentials, or source code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **HTTP POST Request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/pingback.axd` endpoint with a malicious XML payload. This payload includes an external DTD reference.
- **External DTD:** The referenced external DTD contains instructions to read a local file and transmit the content to an attacker controlled server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable BlogEngine.NET instance to send HTTP requests.
- **Ability to Host Malicious Files:** The attacker must be able to host an external DTD file which is used to retrieve files from the vulnerable server.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The specific line of code `doc.LoadXml(xml)` in `PingbackHandler.cs` is identified as the source of the vulnerability because it loads the XML content without disabling the processing of external entities.
- The content details a complete exploit flow including the malicious XML payload, the external DTD content, and the final exfiltration of the file contents to the attacker.
- The blog post also references an exploit script available on GitHub, demonstrating how to automate the attack.
- The content also mentions a second, related vulnerability, CVE-2019-11392, which is an XXE vulnerability in the `/syndication.axd` endpoint.
