## Introduction

The Delphix Plugin for Jenkins enables teams to integrate the Delphix DevOps Data Platform within their automated pipelines. With Jenkins and Delphix, customers can automatically provision and destroy ephemeral data environments quickly to improve automated testing and automatically resolve common IT requests. Teams who successfully integrate the solution within their pipelines have experienced improved application quality, faster delivery cycles, and ultimately happier teams and customers. The plugin leverages the Data Control Tower (DCT)’s APIs to communicate with the Delphix Engines.

### Example Use Cases

* Provision an Oracle database and send the connectivity information to a Quality Assurance team member via email, Slack, or Teams.
* Provision a PostgreSQL database, attach a test Application, run a Selenium or JUnit testing plan, report the results, and then destroy the database.
* Provision Oracle and MySQL databases simultaneously to complete manual integration testing.
* Destroy all Microsoft SQL Server databases at a specific time on a specific day every, week.

## Installation

Install through Jenkins Plugin Manager or download [here](https://plugins.jenkins.io/delphix).

> **WARNING:** The v3.0.0+ versions of the Delphix Plugin leverage Delphix's Data Control Tower APIs which is a different approach from prior versions. There is no supported upgrade path from v1.x and v2.x to v3.x+

## Pre-Requisites

* Jenkins server or CloudBees CI v2.346.1 and greater
* Delphix Data Control Tower v7.0.1 or greater
* One or more connected Delphix Continuous Data Engines v6.0.14.2 or greater. [Consult our DCT documentation for more information](https://dct.delphix.com/docs).

## Usage

#### **Global Configuration**

After the plugin has been installed, DCT will need to be connected. Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System, scroll down to the Delphix section, and enter your DCT URL. This URL will be automatically used for every plugin step on the Jenkins server.

Select the `Disable SSL certificate check` checkbox if the DCT server has an insecure SSL Certificate.
\*We recommend configuring your DCT server with an SSL certificate for production usage.

#### **Credentials**

The Delphix Plugin uses an API Key to run commands against the DCT server. We recommend granting this key access to only the Objects and Actions that it requires using the Principle of Least Privilege. The API Key is created and managed directly within the DCT server. More information can be found in DCT’s documentation.

[More information can be found in DCT’s documentation](https://dct.delphix.com/docs).

The API KEY has to be saved on Jenkins’s side as a Secret text. In Jenkins, go to Credentials > Global > Add Credentials, select the Secret text type, and fill in the inputs

[![Alt text](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/delphix-plugin@master/images/credentials.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/delphix-plugin/blob/master/images/credentials.png)

More than one set of API Keys can be specified within your Jenkins server. Simply call the desired Credential ID in your Jenkins jobs. We recommend creating keys for specific teams, individuals, or purposes.

#### **Plugin Steps**

We offer a handful of steps in the Delphix plugin. All steps can be configured through the Freestyle Project UI builder or Pipeline scripting.

* Provision VDB From Snapshot (provisionVDBFromSnapshot) - Create an Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and other databases from a Delphix Snapshot.
* Provision VDB From Bookmark (provisionVDBFromBookmark)- Create an Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and other databases from a Data Control Tower Bookmark.
* Delete VDB (deleteVDB) - Shutdown and destroy a provisioned VDB.

[![Alt text](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/delphix-plugin@master/images/build_step.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/delphix-plugin/blob/master/images/build_step.png)

All steps leverage DCT APIs. Many advanced properties can be configured by identifying the matching DCT API and specifying the values in the “Additional Values” field.

#### **Advanced Settings**

It is possible to share assets created between build steps. The provision operation has its output saved in a properties file.

* Jenkinsfile Script - All steps can be run through the Jenkins pipeline. We highly recommend using the [Snippet Generator] (<https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/#snippet-generator>) to help construct your commands. Below we’ve presented a few samples to help you get started.

Provision VDB from Bookmark Example:-

```
provisionVDBFromBookmark  name: 'BMKSAMP', bookmarkId: '<Input Bookmark ID>', autoSelectRepository: true, credentialId: '<Input DCT Key 1.abc1234567890>'

```

Provision VDB From Bookmark and dynamically resolve API Key Example:-

```
withCredentials([string(credentialsId: 'DCT_API_KEY', variable: 'KEY')]) {
      	provisionVDBFromBookmark  name: 'KEYSAMP', bookmarkId: '<Input Bookmark ID>', autoSelectRepository: true, credentialId: '${KEY}',
}

```

Provision VDB From dSource Example:-

```
provisionVDBFromSnapshot  name: 'dSrcSAMP', sourceDataId: '<Input dSource ID>', autoSelectRepository: true, credentialId: '<Input DCT Key 1.abc1234567890>'

```

* Properties File - This file allows the sharing values between build steps. The provision operation has its output saved in a properties file and the name this file can be updated to maintain multiple within a single Jenkins job. The Delete VDB step can call upon this properties file automatically. [Additional details about Properties File usage can be found in this video] (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQS7Idaq_ME>).

Delete VDB From Properties File Example:-

```
deleteVDB loadFromProperties: true, credentialId: '<Input DCT Key 1.abc1234567890>'

```

SECURITY-1583 / CVE-2019-10436
Google OAuth Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of credentials based
on the content of files on the Jenkins master through a feature retaining
backwards compatibility with earlier plugin releases.

This allowed users with the permission to configure jobs and credentials to
read arbitrary files on the Jenkins master by creating a credential
referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins master.

SECURITY-1006 (1) / CVE-2019-10437 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10438 (permission check)
CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin did not perform permission checks on a
method implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read
access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1006 (2) / CVE-2019-10439
CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin provides a list of applicable
credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to
use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

SECURITY-1427 / CVE-2019-10440
NeoLoad Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration
file org.jenkinsci.plugins.neoload.integration.NeoGlobalConfig.xml and in
job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the master file
system.

SECURITY-1484 / CVE-2019-10441 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10442 (permission check)
iceScrum Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing
form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to
initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-
specified access token or username and password.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-1436 / CVE-2019-10443
iceScrum Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml files on
the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission or access to the master file system.

with Overall/Read permission to obtain limited information about the scope
and access of a credential with an attacker-specified credential ID
obtained through another method.

SECURITY-1615 / CVE-2019-10446
Cadence vManager Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate
validation for the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-918 / CVE-2019-10458
Puppet Enterprise Pipeline Plugin defines a custom whitelist for all
scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass
Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code
execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

As of publication of this advisory there is no fix.

SECURITY-1431 / CVE-2019-10447

## Descriptions

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in Google OAuth Credentials Plugin

**SECURITY-1583
/
CVE-2019-10436**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-oauth-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-oauth-plugin)**

**Description:**

Google OAuth Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of credentials based on the content of files on the Jenkins controller through a feature retaining backwards compatibility with earlier plugin releases.
This allowed users with the permission to configure jobs and credentials to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by creating a credential referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller.

Google OAuth Credentials Plugin no longer allows a regular user to create credentials in the legacy format.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1006 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10437 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10438 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`crx-content-package-deployer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/crx-content-package-deployer)**

**Description:**

CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin now requires POST requests and Item/Configure permission.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin

**SECURITY-1006 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10439**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`crx-content-package-deployer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/crx-content-package-deployer)**

**Description:**

CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
