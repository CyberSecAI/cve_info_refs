Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10453:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Delphix Plugin for Jenkins was storing credentials in an unencrypted format within its global configuration file (`io.jenkins.plugins.delphix.GlobalConfiguration.xml`) on the Jenkins master.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage:** The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive credentials in plain text. This makes the credentials easily accessible if an attacker gains access to the Jenkins master file system.
   
**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Exposure:** An attacker gaining access to the Jenkins master's file system could read the unencrypted credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to the Delphix environment or any systems those credentials could access.
 
**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who can access the Jenkins controller's file system.
   
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **File System Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to access the file system where Jenkins is running and can read the `io.jenkins.plugins.delphix.GlobalConfiguration.xml` file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information indicates that a fix for this vulnerability was not available at the time of the advisory's publication (October 16, 2019).
*   The vulnerability is listed as having a low severity, likely due to the requirement of having access to the Jenkins controller's file system. However, the risk is elevated if a system is poorly secured or has multiple users.
