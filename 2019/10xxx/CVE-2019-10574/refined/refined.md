The provided content discusses a vulnerability in Qualcomm's TrustZone implementation, specifically in the context of trusted applications (trustlets) running within the Secure Execution Environment (QSEE). The vulnerability was found through a custom-built fuzzing platform. While CVE-2019-10574 is mentioned as the vulnerability patched by Qualcomm, the root cause is not explicitly detailed in the context of the trustlet itself, rather the vulnerability stems from a flaw in QSEOS's trustlet verification mechanism.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of the vulnerability:**

*   The primary vulnerability detailed lies in the **trustlet verification process** of Qualcomm's Secure OS (QSEOS). The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the trustlet verification and load a patched trustlet into the secure world. This vulnerability is not directly in a trustlet but in the verification process.
* The specific trustlet mentioned in the context of the CVE is `kmota`.
*   The *prov* trustlet was discovered to be vulnerable to an integer overflow at the command handler for `0x7000D`, where the input is not checked if it is greater than 9999.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Bypass of Trustlet Verification:** The primary weakness lies in the QSEOS's trustlet verification process. An attacker can patch the QSEOS data segment to manipulate the hash block used to verify the trustlet before the actual segment hash verification. This enables the loading of a modified trustlet.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `prov` trustlet's command handler lacks proper input validation, leading to a crash when receiving an argument greater than 9999 for the 0x7000D command ID.
*   **Reliance on Secure World Memory:** Trustlets assume a base address of 0 for their data pointers. On Android 8 and 9 devices, this assumption no longer holds true, but can be patched, this is not a vulnerability itself but a requirement for proper emulation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Execution of Arbitrary Code:** By loading a patched trustlet, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the secure environment.
*   **Leakage of Secure Data:**  A compromised trustlet can potentially lead to leakage of protected data.
*   **Device Rooting/Bootloader Unlocking:** Exploiting TEE vulnerabilities can enable device rooting, bootloader unlocking, and persistent malware installation.
*   **APT Execution:** It can also facilitate the execution of undetectable Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) due to the high execution permissions and security of TEE.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Exploitation of SBL Vulnerability:** To bypass trustlet verification, the attacker must exploit a vulnerability in the Secondary Bootloader (SBL) to patch the QSEOS data segment. The specific exploit used was a chain of two exploits, CVE-2015-6639 and CVE-2016-2431.
*   **Malformed Input:** The `prov` trustlet can be crashed by sending a crafted input buffer with an invalid command parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Physical Access (Initial):**  The attacker initially requires physical access to the device to exploit the SBL vulnerability, allowing them to modify QSEOS.
*   **Exploit Chain:** The attacker needs knowledge of and the ability to execute the exploit chain against the SBL.
*   **Knowledge of TrustZone Components:** The attacker requires in-depth knowledge of TrustZone, QSEE, QSEOS, and trustlet structures.
*   **Ability to Patch Trustlets:** The attacker needs to be able to modify trustlets and bypass the signature verification mechanism.
*   **Fuzzing Infrastructure:**  The attacker needs the setup of a custom fuzzing platform that can execute trustlets in a controlled environment, including the ability to emulate syscalls.

**Additional Details:**

*   The researchers developed a custom fuzzing platform using QEMU and AFL to test the trusted apps.
*   The fuzzing platform also emulated the execution of the trustlets in the Normal world (Android OS) by patching the trustlets to provide hooks for communication.
*   The blog post details the technical steps involved in patching trustlets from different devices to work on a Nexus 6 device for testing purposes.
*  The blog post indicates that the vulnerability was disclosed to Qualcomm in June and patched with CVE-2019-10574 after a period of time.
