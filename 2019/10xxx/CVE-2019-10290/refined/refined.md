Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10290:

**CVE-2019-10290**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Missing permission check and lack of CSRF protection in the Netsparker Enterprise Scan Plugin. Specifically, a form validation method lacks proper permission checks and doesn't require POST requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** Users with Overall/Read permissions could trigger a connection test to an arbitrary server.
    *   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The form validation method does not require POST requests, enabling Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can leverage this to initiate a connection test to an arbitrary server, potentially leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This could allow the attacker to probe internal network resources or interact with other services that are not directly exposed.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A user with Overall/Read permissions to Jenkins can trigger the connection test.
    *   CSRF attack through a crafted request.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permissions to the Jenkins instance.
    *   Ability to craft or induce a victim to trigger a malicious HTTP request to the Jenkins server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also describes multiple other vulnerabilities in various Jenkins plugins, all related to either storing credentials in plain text or missing permission checks combined with CSRF issues. These other vulnerabilities are tracked under different CVE IDs.
*   The fix for this specific vulnerability involves adding a permission check for Overall/Administer and enforcing that requests are sent via POST in the form validation method of the Netsparker Enterprise Scan Plugin.
