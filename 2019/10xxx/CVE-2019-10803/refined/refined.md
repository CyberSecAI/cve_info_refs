Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-10803 vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability:** Command Injection
*   **Affected Package:** `push-dir` npm package, all versions.
*   **Root Cause:** The `opt.branch` argument is not validated before being passed to the `git` command in `index.js#L139`.
*   **Attack Vector:** By providing a malicious `opt.branch` value, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the `git` command executed by the `push-dir` package.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the system where `push-dir` is used.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to control the `opt.branch` argument passed to the `pushDir` function.
*   **Proof of Concept:**
    ```javascript
    var root = require("push-dir");
    var opt = {"branch": "& echo vulnerable > create.txt &"};
    root(opt);
    ```
    This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can inject a command to create a file named `create.txt` with the content "vulnerable" on the system.
*   **Fix:** There is no fixed version for `push-dir`.
