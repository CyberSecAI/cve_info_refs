Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10464:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Deploy WebLogic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on a form validation method, allowing unauthorized users to trigger potentially harmful actions.
*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method does not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure/Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can send HTTP HEAD requests to a user-specified URL, effectively probing the existence of files or directories on the Jenkins controller. This can expose sensitive internal network information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack can be initiated remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **User Interaction:** For the CSRF portion of the attack, the victim user needs to be tricked into interacting with a crafted request. However, the permission check bypass does not require user interaction

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have "Overall/Read" access to the Jenkins instance, as defined in Jenkins' permission model
*   For the CSRF portion, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in Jenkins user to trigger a crafted request.

**Summary:**
The Deploy WebLogic Plugin suffers from both a missing permission check and a CSRF vulnerability. These vulnerabilities allow an attacker with low-level Jenkins access to probe the Jenkins controller for information or initiate HTTP requests to internal services, potentially leading to further attacks or information disclosure.
