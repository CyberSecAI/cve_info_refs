SECURITY-1628 / CVE-2019-10459
Mattermost allows the definition of incoming (from the perspective of the
service) webhook URLs. These contain what is effectively a secret token as
part of the URL.

Mattermost Notification Plugin stored these webhook URLs as part of its
global configuration file jenkins.plugins.mattermost.MattermostNotifier.xml
and job config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These URLs could be viewed
by users with Extended Read permission (in the case of job config.xml files)
or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1546 / CVE-2019-10460
Bitbucket OAuth Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in the global
config.xml configuration file on the Jenkins master. This credential could
be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

Bitbucket OAuth Plugin now stores this credential encrypted.

SECURITY-1621 / CVE-2019-10476
Zulip Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in its global configuration
file jenkins.plugins.zulip.ZulipNotifier.xml, as well as in the legacy
configuration file hudson.plugins.humbug.HumbugNotifier.xml on the Jenkins
master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

SECURITY-1477 / CVE-2019-10461
Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin stored a credential unencrypted in
its global configuration file
com.dynatrace.jenkins.dashboard.TAGlobalConfiguration.xml on the Jenkins
master. This credential could be viewed by users with access to the master
file system.

SECURITY-1483 (1) / CVE-2019-10462
Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin did not require POST requests on a
method implementing form validation. This CSRF vulnerability allowed
attackers to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server
with attacker-specified username and password.

SECURITY-1483 (2) / CVE-2019-10463
Dynatrace Application Monitoring Plugin does not perform permission checks
on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an
attacker-specified server with attacker-specified username and password.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-820 / CVE-2019-10464 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10465 (permission check)
Deploy WebLogic Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a user-specified URL, or confirm
the existence of any file or directory on the Jenkins master.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-822 / CVE-2019-10466
360 FireLine Plugin accepts XML for part of its configuration. It does not
configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.

A form validation method that accepts XML does not perform permission
checks. This allows users with Overall/Read permission to have Jenkins
parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of
secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or
denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1003 / CVE-2019-10467
Sonar Gerrit Plugin stores a credential unencrypted in job config.xml files
on the Jenkins master if the 'Override Credentials' option is used. This
credential can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1005 (1) / CVE-2019-10468 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10469 (permission check)
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin does not perform permission
checks on a method implementing form validation. This allows users with
Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL
using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1005 (2) / CVE-2019-10470
ElasticBox Jenkins Kubernetes CI/CD Plugin provides a list of applicable
credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to
use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (1) / CVE-2019-10471 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10472 (permission check)
Libvirt Slaves Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (2) / CVE-2019-10473
Libvirt Slaves Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1073 / CVE-2019-10474
Global Post Script Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
permission to list the files contained in $JENKINS_HOME/global-post-script
that can be used by the plugin.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1490 / CVE-2019-10475
build-metrics Plugin does not properly escape the label query parameter,
resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.
