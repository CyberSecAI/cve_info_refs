Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way the EnterpriseDB Windows installer for PostgreSQL handles OpenSSL configuration. When the database server or libpq client library initializes SSL, the `libeay32.dll` file attempts to read configuration from a hard-coded directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unprotected Directory:** The hard-coded directory where OpenSSL looks for configuration is typically non-existent. However, any local user can create this directory and place a malicious configuration file within it.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting a crafted configuration file, an attacker can direct OpenSSL to load and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the PostgreSQL server or client.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system running the vulnerable PostgreSQL installation.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the system, depending on the privileges of the user running PostgreSQL.
*   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored in the database or other system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the machine where the vulnerable PostgreSQL server or client is installed.
*   **Directory Creation:** The attacker needs to be able to create a directory at the hard-coded path where OpenSSL looks for its configuration file.
*   **Configuration Injection:** The attacker needs to be able to inject a malicious OpenSSL configuration file into the created directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker must have local user privileges on the target machine.
*   **File System Write Access:** The attacker must have the ability to create directories and write files to the file system, specifically in the hard-coded location where OpenSSL looks for its configuration.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects the EnterpriseDB Windows installer for PostgreSQL versions 9.4 through 11.
*   The issue is similar to CVE-2019-5443, but originated independently.
*   A workaround is available by setting the environment variable `OPENSSL_CONF` to "NUL:/openssl.cnf" or any other name that cannot exist as a file.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in PostgreSQL versions 11.5, 10.10, 9.6.15, 9.5.19, and 9.4.24.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Daniel Gustafsson of the curl security team.
