Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10880:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary vulnerability is a "Remote Command Execution vulnerability," as stated in the Xerox bulletin.
*   A "Hacked Clone dlm allows running of unwanted binaries during a clone file install" (mentioned in XRX19AP). This suggests a flaw in how clone files are processed, allowing malicious code injection during installation.
*   "Password field incorrectly submitted using GET method allows contents of field to be visible."  Although not a command execution flaw, this is a vulnerability mentioned in conjunction to the main issue.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Command Execution (RCE):** The core issue is the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the affected Xerox devices.
*   **Insecure Clone File Processing:** The system's handling of clone files is flawed, allowing for the execution of malicious binaries included within them.
*  **Insecure password handling:** Submission of password field using GET method which allows for the content to be visible in the URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation of the RCE vulnerability can lead to complete control of the affected printer, potentially enabling attackers to steal sensitive data, use the device as a beachhead for further attacks within a network, or disrupt printer functionality.
*  **Exposing sensitive data:** Insecure password handling can lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Clone Files:** Attackers can create specially crafted clone files containing malicious executables to exploit the insecure clone file installation process.
*  **Network:** Using HTTP GET method can expose the password in URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the targeted Xerox printers to upload malicious clone files, or send malicious GET requests.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** Attackers need sufficient technical understanding to create malicious clone files or craft malicious requests to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Xerox bulletin XRX19C acknowledges RaphaÃ«l Rigo from the AIRBUS Security Lab for reporting this vulnerability, although other researchers may also have identified the issue independently.
*   The affected models include various WorkCentre and ColorQube printers.
*   The document includes information on software versions to check whether a device is vulnerable and how to apply updates.

**Summary**

CVE-2019-10880 is a critical vulnerability that allows remote command execution on affected Xerox printers due to insecure clone file processing. It poses a serious risk of system compromise and is further exacerbated by insecure password handling.
