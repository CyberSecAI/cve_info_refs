Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10373:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10373

**Description:**

The Build Pipeline Plugin in Jenkins does not properly escape variables in views, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This vulnerability is exploitable by users who have permission to configure build pipelines. However, it's important to note that this vulnerability is only exploitable on Jenkins releases older than 2.146 or 2.138.2 due to security hardening implemented in those versions.

**Root Cause:** Improper variable escaping in views within the Build Pipeline Plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the view, which will be executed in the browsers of other users who access the view. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.

**Attack Vectors:** An attacker with the ability to configure build pipelines injects malicious code via unescaped variables in views.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the permission to configure build pipelines in Jenkins.
- The Jenkins instance must be running a version older than 2.146 or 2.138.2

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity.
- A fix for this specific vulnerability was not available at the time of this advisory.
