RELATED: CVE-2019-10867

Root cause of vulnerability:
- PHP unserialize() vulnerability in Pimcore before 5.7.1.
- Passing untrusted values in the "data" parameter to the "bulk-commit" method of the "ClassController.php" class allows exploiting the unserialize function.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote code execution (RCE).
- Total loss of confidentiality, potentially leading to the disclosure of all resources within the impacted component.
- Modification of data is possible.
- Reduced performance or interruptions in resource availability

Attack vectors:
- An authenticated user with "classes" permission can send a POST request to `/admin/class/bulk-commit` with a crafted "data" parameter containing a serialized payload.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Authenticated user with "classes" permission.
- Ability to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
