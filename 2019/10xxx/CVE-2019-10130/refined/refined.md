  "CVE-2019-10130": {
    "description": "PostgreSQL maintains column statistics for tables. Certain statistics, such as histograms and lists of most common values, contain values taken from the column. PostgreSQL does not evaluate row security policies before consulting those statistics during query planning; an attacker can exploit this to read the most common values of certain columns. Affected columns are those for which the attacker has SELECT privilege and for which, in an ordinary query, row-level security prunes the set of rows visible to the attacker.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from how PostgreSQL's query planner utilizes column statistics, which include sampled data from columns.  Row-level security (RLS) policies are not evaluated before this statistics data is consulted during query planning.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Bypass of row-level security policies",
        "Information disclosure"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with SELECT privileges on a column, but where row-level security (RLS) policies would normally restrict access to rows, can utilize a 'leaky operator' to read sampled data from the column, potentially revealing values from rows they should not be able to access.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted SQL queries using a leaky operator"
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have the ability to connect to the database and execute crafted queries. They must have SELECT privilege on a column protected by RLS.",
       "affected_versions": [
        "PostgreSQL 11.x before 11.3",
         "PostgreSQL 10.x before 10.8",
        "PostgreSQL 9.6.x before 9.6.13",
         "PostgreSQL 9.5.x before 9.5.17",
        "PostgreSQL 9.4.x before 9.4.24"
       ],
     "fix": "The fix implemented is to prevent non-leakproof operators from using statistical data if there is an active row-level security policy."
