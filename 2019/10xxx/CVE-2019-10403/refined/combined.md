## Descriptions

### Stored XSS vulnerability in expandable textbox form control

**SECURITY-1498
/
CVE-2019-10401**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins form controls include an expandable textbox that can transform from a single-line text box to a multi-line text area.

The implementation of this transformation interpreted the text content of the form field as HTML.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of such `f:expandableTextbox` form controls.

Jenkins no longer interprets `f:expandableTextbox` text content as HTML when transforming it.

### XSS vulnerability in combobox form control

**SECURITY-1525
/
CVE-2019-10402**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins interpreted items added to `f:combobox` form controls as HTML.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of `f:combobox` form controls.

Jenkins no longer interprets items added to a combobox as HTML.

|  | This might be a breaking change for plugins that relied on the previous, undocumented behavior to add formatting to `f:combobox` elements. This has been removed without replacement. Plugin developers are advised to only add plain text entries to `f:combobox` controls. |

### Stored XSS vulnerability in SCM tag action tooltip

**SECURITY-1537 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10403**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown in the build history.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the SCM tag name for these actions.

Jenkins now escapes the SCM tag action.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in queue item tooltip

**SECURITY-1537 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10404**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not escape the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked, for example a label expression that does not match idle executors.

Jenkins now escapes the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.

### Diagnostic web page exposed Cookie HTTP header

**SECURITY-1505
/
CVE-2019-10405**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins shows various technical information about the current user on the `/whoAmI` URL.
The information shown includes HTTP request headers.

This allowed attackers able to exploit another cross-site scripting vulnerability to obtain the `Cookie` headerâ€™s value even if the `HttpOnly` flag would prevent direct access via JavaScript.

Jenkins no longer shows the value of the `Cookie` HTTP header on the `/whoAmI` URL.

### XSS vulnerability in Jenkins URL setting

**SECURITY-1471
/
CVE-2019-10406**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins did not validate or otherwise limit the possible values administrators could specify as Jenkins root URL.

This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users with Overall/Administer permission.

Jenkins now prevents values other than HTTP/HTTPS URLs from being set as Jenkins root URL.
Existing instances with invalid root URLs will behave as if no root URL was set.

|  | In case this results in problems, e.g. a valid URL unexpectedly being rejected, set the system property `jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.disableUrlValidation` to `true` to disable this restriction. [Learn more about system properties in Jenkins](/doc/book/managing/system-properties/). |

### Project Inheritance Plugin showed secret environment variables defined in Mask Passwords Plugin

**SECURITY-351
/
CVE-2019-10407**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Mask Passwords Plugin allows users to define secret environment variables (typically passwords) to be passed to builds, both globally, and for specific jobs.
These environment variables are expected to not be shown.

Project Inheritance Plugin showed the variable values on its *Full Build Flow* view and included them in the metadata download without masking.

Project Inheritance Plugin no longer shows variables contributed from Mask Password Plugin without masking.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Project Inheritance Plugin

**SECURITY-401
/
CVE-2019-10408 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10409 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`project-inheritance`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/project-inheritance)**

**Description:**

Project Inheritance Plugin allows the creation of projects based on templates defined in the plugin configuration.

A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint triggering project creation allowed users with Overall/Read permission to create these projects.
Additionally, the HTTP endpoint did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

The HTTP endpoint triggering project creation now requires Item/Create permission and submission of requests via POST.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Log Parser Plugin

**SECURITY-732
/
CVE-2019-10410**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`log-parser`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/log-parser)**

**Description:**

Log Parser Plugin did not escape an error message shown when log parsing patterns are invalid.
This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

Log Parser Plugin now escapes all variables displayed in its views.

### NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

SECURITY-1498 / CVE-2019-10401
Jenkins form controls include an expandable textbox that can transform
from a single-line text box to a multi-line text area.

The implementation of this transformation interpreted the text content of
the form field as HTML. This resulted in a cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the contents of
such f:expandableTextbox form controls.

SECURITY-1525 / CVE-2019-10402
Jenkins interpreted items added to f:combobox form controls as HTML. This
resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers
able to control the contents of f:combobox form controls.

SECURITY-1537 (1) / CVE-2019-10403
Jenkins did not escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown
in the build history. This resulted in a cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the SCM tag name
for these actions.

SECURITY-1537 (2) / CVE-2019-10404
Jenkins did not escape the reason a queue item is blocked in tooltips.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by
attackers able to control the reason a queue item is blocked, for example
a label expression that does not match idle executors.

SECURITY-1505 / CVE-2019-10405
Jenkins shows various technical information about the current user on the
/whoAmI URL. The information shown includes HTTP request headers.

This allowed attackers able to exploit another cross-site scripting
vulnerability to obtain the Cookie headerâ€™s value even if the HttpOnly
flag would prevent direct access via JavaScript.

SECURITY-1471 / CVE-2019-10406
Jenkins did not validate or otherwise limit the possible values
administrators could specify as Jenkins root URL.

This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by users
with Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-351 / CVE-2019-10407
Mask Passwords Plugin allows users to define secret environment variables
(typically passwords) to be passed to builds, both globally, and for
specific jobs. These environment variables are expected to not be shown.

Project Inheritance Plugin showed the variable values on its Full Build
Flow view and included them in the metadata download without masking.

SECURITY-401 / CVE-2019-10408 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10409 (permission check)
Project Inheritance Plugin allows the creation of projects based on
templates defined in the plugin configuration.

A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint triggering project
creation allowed users with Overall/Read permission to create these
projects. Additionally, the HTTP endpoint did not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

SECURITY-732 / CVE-2019-10410
Log Parser Plugin did not escape an error message shown when log parsing
patterns are invalid. This resulted in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the log parsing
rules configuration, typically users with Job/Configure permission.

Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS
2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability.

SECURITY-1504 / CVE-2019-10430
NeuVector Vulnerability Scanner Plugin stored registry credentials
unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. These
credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1507 / CVE-2019-10427
Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stores a token credential in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the token is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
token through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and
similar situations.

SECURITY-1508 / CVE-2019-10428
Aqua Security Scanner Plugin stores a password in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1513 / CVE-2019-10411
Inedo BuildMaster Plugin Plugin stores a service password in its global
Jenkins configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1514 / CVE-2019-10412
Inedo ProGet Plugin Plugin stores a service password in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

SECURITY-1557 / CVE-2019-10413
Data Theorem: CI/CD Plugin stored a proxy password unencrypted in job
config.xml files on the Jenkins master. This password could be viewed by
users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1574 / CVE-2019-10414

config.xml files on the Jenkins master. These passwords could be viewed by
users with Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1575 / CVE-2019-10429
GitLab Logo Plugin stored a private token unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. This token could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1577 / CVE-2019-10415 (global password), CVE-2019-10416 (job password)
Violation Comments to GitLab Plugin stored API tokens unencrypted in job
config.xml files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins master.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-920 (1) / CVE-2019-10417
Kubernetes :: Pipeline :: Kubernetes Steps Plugin defines a custom whitelist
for all scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom whitelist allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass
Script Security sandbox protection. This results in arbitrary code execution
on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-920 (2) / CVE-2019-10418
Kubernetes :: Pipeline :: Arquillian Steps Plugin defines a custom whitelist
