Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-10403:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Jenkins core did not properly escape the tag name on the tooltip for tag actions shown in the build history.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper escaping of the tag name when rendering the tooltip allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the tooltip.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser session when they view the build history with the crafted tag name. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Other malicious activities that the attacker could perform within the context of the user's browser session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SCM Tag Name Manipulation:** An attacker would need to be able to influence the SCM tag name associated with a build. This could be done through:
    *   Directly creating a malicious tag.
    *   Modifying existing tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over SCM Tag Names:** The attacker needs to be able to control the SCM tag name associated with a build.
*   **User Interaction:** The user has to view the build history for the XSS to be triggered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning that the malicious code is stored persistently and executed whenever a user views the build history with the manipulated tag.
*   The fix implemented involves escaping the SCM tag action to prevent the interpretation of the tag name as HTML.
