  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE-2019-10135": {
      "description": "A flaw was found in the yaml.load() function in the osbs-client versions since 0.46 before 0.56.1. Insecure use of the yaml.load() function allowed the user to load any suspicious object for code execution via the parsing of malicious YAML files.",
      "root_cause": "The osbs-client uses `yaml.load()` to parse YAML files, which is insecure. This function can deserialize arbitrary objects, leading to code execution if the YAML contains malicious object definitions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insecure deserialization",
        "Use of unsafe yaml.load()"
      ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. An attacker can craft a malicious YAML file that, when parsed by the vulnerable application, executes arbitrary code on the server.",
      "attack_vectors": "By providing a malicious YAML file to the osbs-client which will parse it with the insecure `yaml.load()` function.",
      "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a YAML file to the osbs-client application to be parsed.",
        "affected_versions": "osbs-client versions since 0.46 before 0.56.1"
