# Unable to use case-insensitive regex flag in only/except for CI

Hi,

We maintain 2 key branches of our software, `master` and `release`. Production is always running the `release` branch.

On occasion we will have an urgent issue which needs to be addressed before we merge our `master` branch in to release as part of our usual cadence.

In these situations our developers will branch from `release` using a branch name like `urg-<issue-number>`. Otherwise we'll branch from `master` with something like `<issue-number>` as the branch name.

Now, sometimes a dev will create a branch like `URG-<issue-number>` or `Urg-<issue-number>` or some other casing combination.

As part of CI any push to a remote branch will attempt to merge either `master` or `release` into said branch to ensure there are no conflicts.

So, urg/Urg/URG branches should be merged against `release` during CI and all other branches against `master`.

The following regex :

`/^urg-.*/i`

Will match against all of the combinations of case etc. that we encounter for our urgent branches.

Thus, the following YAML should be good :

```
urgent-job:
  only:
    - /^urg-.*/i

not-urgent-job:
  except:
    - /^urg-.*/i
```

Should suffice for only running `urgent-job` on urgent branches, otherwise run `not-urgent-job`

**However; in practice, both jobs run on all branches.**

Experimenting we found the regex flag **/i** was causing the regex to effectively not be used at all, so the YAML was altered :

```
urgent-job:
  only:
    - /^urg-.*/

not-urgent-job:
  except:
    - /^urg-.*/
```

This results in the `urgent-job` running only on `urg-*` branches, which is great. However; `URG-*` and other variants were running `not-urgent-job`.

The solution is this :

```
urgent-job:
  only:
    - /^[Uu][Rr][Gg]-.*/

not-urgent-job:
  except:
    - /^[Uu][Rr][Gg]-.*/
```

But this is obviously kind of gross.

So, the question is; can you use modifier flags on the end of your regex in the only / except sections of the YAML, and if so, what is the precise syntax to use?
