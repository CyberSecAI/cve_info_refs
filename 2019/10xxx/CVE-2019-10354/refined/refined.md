  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views. These views are frequently comprised of several view fragments. In some cases, attackers could directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.",

      "Unauthorized access to view fragments",
      "Bypassed permission checks"

      "Direct access to view fragments via a web request."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a web request to the Jenkins server. The attacker also needs to know the URI of the sensitive view fragment."
