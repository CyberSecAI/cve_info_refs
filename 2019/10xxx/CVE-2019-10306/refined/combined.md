# ontrack Jenkins

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Stored XSS vulnerability](https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-06-22/#SECURITY-2784)

* [Documentation](/ontrack/)
* [Releases](/ontrack/releases/)
* [Issues](/ontrack/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/ontrack/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/ontrack/healthscore/)

This plug-in allow Jenkins to notify *[ontrack](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack)* about events like build creation, status of running job, etc... but also allows Jenkins to require information from *ontrack*.

It allows to run the following actions:

* creating a new build
* promoting an existing build
* validating an existing build according to the result of the build
* execute any arbitrary [DSL](https://github.com/nemerosa/ontrack/wiki/DSL) as a step or as a publisher
* setup a build environment using the DSL
* evaluating a [condition](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Run%2BCondition%2BPlugin) based on a DSL evaluation

## Setup

You can install the *Ontrack Jenkins plug-in* on any Jenkins version starting from 2.7.

## Usage

To configure the build, go in *Manage Jenkins > Configure System* and enter the following data in the *Ontrack configuration* section:

* *Configuration name in ontrack* — name of the Jenkins configuration *in Ontrack* ; this configuration will be used to generated back links to the Jenkins instance you are configuring. This will be used by the *Build notifier*.
* *URL* — base URL to the Ontrack instance
* *User* and *Password* — user used for the connection to Ontrack - this user must have enough rights for the actions it has to carry from within Jenkins. Usually, giving a *Controller* role should be enough.
* *Max tries* - number of times a call to Ontrack must be repeated in case of failure
* *Retry delay* - number of seconds between each retry attempt
* *Remote Ontrack version cache* - number of seconds we consider the version from Ontrack being valid. This version is used by some plugin services which need to ensure backward compatibility
* *Security mode* - defines how the security must be enforced

Five individual plug-ins are provided by the general *Ontrack plug-in*.

## Integrations

* [Job DSL plug-in integration](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ontrack-plugin/blob/master/JOB_DSL.md)
* [Ontrack DSL](https://github.com/jenkinsci/ontrack-plugin/blob/master/ONTRACK_DSL.md) notes

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-04-17

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Azure PublisherSettings Credentials
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-publishersettings-credentials)
* [GitLab
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin)
* [jira-ext
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira-ext)
* [ontrack Jenkins
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ontrack)
* [XebiaLabs XL Deploy
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)

## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission checks in GitLab Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1357
/
CVE-2019-10300 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10301 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitlab-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitlab-plugin)**

**Description:**

GitLab Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### jira-ext Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-836
/
CVE-2019-10302**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`jira-ext`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/jira-ext)**

**Description:**

jira-ext Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `hudson.plugins.jira.JiraProjectProperty.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

jira-ext Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-844
/
CVE-2019-10303**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-publishersettings-credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-publishersettings-credentials)**

**Description:**

Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin stored the service management certificate unencrypted in `credentials.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin has been deprecated.
Azure PublisherSettings Credentials Plugin 1.5 no longer provides any user features and we recommend the plugin be uninstalled.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin

**SECURITY-983
/
CVE-2019-10304 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10305 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`deployit-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/deployit-plugin)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in a form validation method in XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

### Sandbox bypass in ontrack Jenkins Plugin

**SECURITY-1341
/
CVE-2019-10306**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`ontrack`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ontrack)**

**Description:**

ontrack Jenkins Plugin supports sandboxed Groovy expressions.
Its sandbox protection could be circumvented during parsing, compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy script.

This allowed users able to control the pluginâs job-specific configuration to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins controller.

ontrack Jenkins Plugin now uses Script Security APIs that apply sandbox protection during these phases.
