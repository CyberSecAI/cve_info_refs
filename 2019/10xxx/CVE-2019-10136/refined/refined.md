{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from an insecure method of computing authentication signatures during user authentication in Spacewalk. The hash input used for generating the signature lacks length fields or field boundaries, allowing manipulation of the token parameters without invalidating the signature.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insecure computation of authentication signatures. Specifically, the lack of separators or length fields between the different parameters in the hash input allows for digit shifting between parameters without detection by the checksum.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with a valid but expired authentication token can manipulate the token's parameters, particularly the server time and expiry offset, to artificially extend the session validity without invalidating the checksum. This allows them to reuse expired tokens and gain unauthorized access.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves capturing a valid, but potentially expired, authentication token. The attacker then manipulates the digits of the token parameters, such as shifting digits from the client ID to server time or from server time to expire offset, without altering the signature. This modified token can then be used to bypass authentication.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have captured a valid, but possibly expired, authentication token. They also need the ability to manipulate the token's parameters by shifting digits between the various fields within the token, understanding how the signature is computed and the lack of separation between the fields. No specific network position is required beyond the ability to intercept or access existing authentication tokens."
