Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10960:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficiently protected credentials in Zebra industrial printers. Specifically, the front panel passcode, when set, is not adequately protected, allowing retrieval through network packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficiently Protected Credentials (CWE-522):** The core issue is that the passcode used to limit access to the printer's front panel is transmitted in a way that allows it to be intercepted by an attacker.
*   The printer responds with an array of information including the front panel passcode if specially crafted packets are sent to a port on the printer over the network.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to obtain the front panel passcode by sending specially crafted packets to a port on the printer.
*   With the passcode, an attacker with *physical access* to the printer can gain full functionality of the printer's front panel. This could potentially lead to unauthorized configuration changes, access to sensitive information or disruption of operations depending on the printer's specific functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The attacker sends specially crafted packets to a specific port on the printer over the network.
*   **Physical access required for full exploitation:** After obtaining the passcode remotely, physical access to the printer's control panel is required to enter it and gain full control of the front panel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected Zebra printer to send malicious packets.
*   **Technical Skills:** The attacker requires a low level of skill to create and send the specific crafted packets to the printer.
*   **Physical Access (Post-Exploitation):** The attacker needs physical access to the printer to use the obtained passcode.

**Additional Details:**
*   The advisory states the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, which contradicts the initial description of a remote attack vector to obtain the passcode. The attack vector for passcode extraction is network-based, but full exploitation needs physical access.
*   The affected products are all Zebra Industrial Printers.
*   The advisory suggests that no known public exploits target this vulnerability.

**Mitigations:**
*   Zebra recommends updating to a newer software version available at the provided link.
*   Zebra recommends not to have printers fully accessible via the Internet.
*   Use secure methods such as VPNs for remote access to the printers.
*   Locate control system networks and devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
