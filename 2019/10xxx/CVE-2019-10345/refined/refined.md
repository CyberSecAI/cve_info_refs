Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10345:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Configuration as Code Plugin provides a custom configurator for the Jenkins proxy configuration. This feature did not mask the password for logging or encrypt it in the export.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plaintext Storage:** The plugin stored the proxy password in plain text during logging and did not encrypt it in the exported configuration.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the logs or exported configuration could potentially obtain the proxy password, which could allow them to impersonate the proxy user or gain access to other systems or network resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** Attackers who have access to the Jenkins system logs could potentially view the proxy password.
- **Exported Configuration Access:** Attackers who gain access to the exported configuration file can view the password if exported before the fix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need at least "Overall/Read" access, or file system access, to view logs, or access the exported configuration file.
