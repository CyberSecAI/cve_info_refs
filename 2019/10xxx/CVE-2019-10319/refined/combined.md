# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

SECURITY-1316 / CVE-2019-10319
A missing permission check in PAM Authentication Plugin allowed users with
Overall/Read permission to invoke a form validation method to obtain
limited information about the file /etc/shadow on systems with that file
present, as well as the system user the Jenkins process is running as.

SECURITY-1322 / CVE-2019-10320
Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials from a
PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins master. Users with permission to create or
update credentials could use the associated form validation to confirm the
existence of files with an attacker-specified path.

Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on
the Jenkins master. With the ability to configure jobs to access these
credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-05-21

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Credentials
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials)
* [PAM Authentication
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pam-auth)

## Descriptions

### Missing permission check allowed obtaining limited information about system configuration in PAM Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-1316
/
CVE-2019-10319**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pam-auth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pam-auth)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in PAM Authentication Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to invoke a form validation method to obtain limited information about the file `/etc/shadow` on systems with that file present, as well as the system user the Jenkins process is running as.

Depending on configuration, one of the following messages could be obtained by an attacker:

* *"Jenkins needs to be able to read /etc/shadow"*
* *"(1) needs to belong to group (2) to read /etc/shadow"*
* *"Either Jenkins needs to run as (3) or (1) needs to belong to group (2) and 'chmod g+r /etc/shadow' needs to be done to enable Jenkins to read /etc/shadow"*
* *"Success"*

The numeric placeholders in the messages above would be populated with the following values:

1. The system user that the Jenkins controller process is running as (usually `jenkins`)
2. The group owning `/etc/shadow`
3. The user owning `/etc/shadow`

This form validation method now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Certificate file read vulnerability in Credentials Plugin

**SECURITY-1322
/
CVE-2019-10320**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials)**

**Description:**

Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials from a PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins controller.
Users with permission to create or update credentials could use the associated form validation to confirm the existence of files with an attacker-specified path.

Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins controller.
With the ability to configure jobs to access these credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.

Credentials Plugin no longer supports Certificate credentials from PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins controller file system.
Existing Certificate credentials of this kind are automatically migrated to *directly entered* Certificate credentials during Jenkins startup.

|  | Due to technical limitations, these migrated credentials are not immediately persisted. In rare situations a non-administrator user might access a credential migrated this way and encounter a permission error. The solution is to save affected credentials manually, either individually through the UI or with the following script for the Script Console:  ``` com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.CredentialsProvider.saveAll() ```    This operation may impact performance.   In almost all cases the automatic migration will work and these additional steps will be unnecessary. |

## Severity

* SECURITY-1316:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)
* SECURITY-1322:
  [Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

## Affected Versions

* **Credentials
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  2.1.18
* **PAM Authentication
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  1.5

## Fix

* **Credentials
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  2.1.19
* **PAM Authentication
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  1.5.1

These versions include fixes to the vulnerabilities described above. All prior versions are considered to be affected by these vulnerabilities unless otherwise indicated.
