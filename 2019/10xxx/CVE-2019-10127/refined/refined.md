Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-10127:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The BigSQL Windows installer for PostgreSQL does not properly restrict permissions on the PostgreSQL binary installation directory and the data directory. Specifically, it does not clear the inherited Access Control List (ACL) entries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Permissive ACLs:** The installer leaves the default, inherited ACLs, which allows unprivileged users to write to directories that should be restricted to trusted users and the PostgreSQL service account.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with both an unprivileged Windows account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code.
- **Data Breach:** An attacker with only an unprivileged Windows account can read arbitrary data directory files, bypassing database-imposed read access limitations.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker with only an unprivileged Windows account can also delete certain data directory files.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the Windows system.
- Requires a system where PostgreSQL was installed using the vulnerable BigSQL Windows installer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **For Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker needs both an unprivileged Windows user account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account.
- **For Data Breach/Manipulation:** The attacker needs an unprivileged Windows user account.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability affects all supported versions of PostgreSQL for the BigSQL installer and possibly older versions.
- The issue is related to the installer not properly setting file system permissions during the installation process.
- The vulnerability allows for privilege escalation because the PostgreSQL service account typically runs with higher privileges, which can be exploited via writing to the binary or data directories.
- The fix involves the BigSQL installer properly locking down the permissions of the PostgreSQL binary installation and data directories.
