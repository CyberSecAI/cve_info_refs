Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10719:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a directory traversal issue in the `/api/upload` endpoint of BlogEngine.NET. Specifically, the `dirPath` parameter, intended to specify the upload directory, does not properly sanitize user input, allowing attackers to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to write files to arbitrary locations within the web root.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation on the `dirPath` parameter in the `/api/upload` endpoint. This allows an attacker to manipulate the file upload path.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** Although the application has some checks to differentiate between image and file uploads, it fails to prevent malicious file uploads through `filemgr` action.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious `PostView.ascx` file to the Themes directory, an attacker can achieve remote code execution by setting the `theme` parameter to the directory of the uploaded file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Write:** Attackers can write files to any location within the web application's root directory by exploiting the directory traversal.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By strategically placing malicious files, such as the `PostView.ascx` file within a theme directory, attackers can execute arbitrary server-side code by accessing the uploaded file via the `theme` parameter or cookie. This can lead to complete compromise of the server.
*   **Server Takeover:** Successful RCE could allow attackers to gain full control of the server, leading to data breaches, malware deployment, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out via specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/api/upload` endpoint. The attacker controls parameters such as the `action`, `dirPath`, and the uploaded file.
*   **Theme Parameter:** The RCE is triggered by accessing the application with the `theme` parameter set to a malicious theme directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication (Edit Posts):** An attacker needs to have the ability to add images or files to posts. This requires `EditOwnPosts` rights.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make HTTP requests to the target BlogEngine.NET instance.
*   **Understanding of File Structure:** The attacker needs to know where to upload the malicious file and how to trigger its execution via a theme setting.
*   **Code Creation:**  The attacker needs to create malicious ASP.NET user control file (.ascx) to gain RCE.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided content also mentions CVE-2019-10720, a similar vulnerability but exploiting the `theme` cookie.
*   The blog post from securitymetrics.com provides a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including code snippets, and a step-by-step exploit guide.
*   The exploit uses a reverse shell payload within the `PostView.ascx` file for demonstration purposes.
