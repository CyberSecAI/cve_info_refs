Logback-core is not packaged as an RPM for Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Red Hat Software Collections. Applications using jackson-databind that do not also use logback-core are not impacted by this vulnerability.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 342 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2788740.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-05-29 19:28:12 UTC  ``` An issue is present in Apache ZooKeeper 1.0.0 to 3.4.13 and 3.5.0-alpha to 3.5.4-beta. ZooKeeper's getACL() command doesn't check any permission when retrieves the ACLs of the requested node and returns all information contained in the ACL Id field as plaintext string. DigestAuthenticationProvider overloads the Id field with the hash value that is used for user authentication. As a consequence, if Digest Authentication is in use, the unsalted hash value will be disclosed by getACL() request for unauthenticated or unprivileged users.   References: <http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108427> <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ZOOKEEPER-1392> <https://zookeeper.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2019-0201>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-05-29 19:28:53 UTC  ``` Created zookeeper tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1715199](show_bug.cgi?id=1715199 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-0201 zookeeper: Information disclosure in Apache ZooKeeper [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c2)  Joshua Padman    2019-08-12 02:26:42 UTC  ``` This vulnerability is out of security support scope for the following product:  * Red Hat JBoss Fuse Service Works 6  Please refer to <https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/jboss_notes> for more details.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1715197#c3)  Chess Hazlett    2019-08-30 13:24:03 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use an authentication method other than Digest (e.g. Kerberos) or upgrade to zookeeper 3.4.14 or later (3.5.5 or later if on the 3.5 branch).

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 391 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2765149.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Additional patches are included in this Critical Patch Update for the following non-exploitable CVEs in this Oracle product family:

* Oracle E-Business Suite Information Discovery
  + Installer (Apache Log4j): CVE-2020-9488.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 9 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  8 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2021verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2021 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2021 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2749094.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2749094.1).

What is the fixing commit? I cannot find any recent commits regarding SafeHTML in <https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-validator>  Thanks   ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=1738673#c20)  Marek Novotny    2019-12-13 07:11:56 UTC  ``` I looked for an usage of SafeHtml and there is no occurrence in the source code so marking RHDM and RHPAM as affected just on existence of hibernate-validator jar or dependency is invalid.  Searched the annotation class in sources: "org.hibernate.validator.constraints.SafeHtml"   ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=1738673#c21)  Paramvir jindal    2019-12-13 14:38:57 UTC  ``` @Marek, Thank you for looking into it.

This issue did not affect the versions of grafana(embeds golang) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 as they did not include the support for HTTP/2. The following storage product versions are affected because they include the support for HTTP/2 in: * golang as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 * heketi(embeds golang) as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 * grafana(embeds golang and grpc) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 This flaw has no available mitigation for packages golang and nodejs. Both packages will be updated once the available fixes are released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections.  The nodejs RPM shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 and 3.10 is not affected by this flaw as it does not contain the vulnerable code.  All OpenShift Container Platform RPMs and container images that are built with Go and support HTTP/2 are vulnerable to this flaw.   ```  [Comment 102](show_bug.cgi?id=1735645#c102)  errata-xmlrpc

  java.util.

## Minor changes

* [#287](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/287): Close stream opened from provided URL.
* [#284](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/284): Fix disabling check against hash code attack with XStream.setCollectionUpdateLimit(0).

## Stream compatibility

* The atomic types with new converters of package java.util.concurrent.atomic, that have been written with
  previous versions of XStream, can still be deserialized.
* The Optional types with new converters of package java.util, that have been written with previous versions
  of XStream, can still be deserialized.
* The WildcardTypePermission allows by default no longer anonymous class types.

## API changes

* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicBooleanConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicIntegerConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicLongConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.AtomicReferenceConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalDoubleConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalIntConverter.
* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.OptionalLongConverter.
* Added c.t.x.security.WildcardTypePermission.WildcardTypePermission(boolean,String[]).

# 1.4.19

Released January 29, 2022.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2021-43859](CVE-2021-43859.html), when unmarshalling highly recursive collections or maps causing a
Denial of Service.

## API changes

* Added c.t.x.XStream.COLLECTION\_UPDATE\_LIMIT and c.t.x.XStream.COLLECTION\_UPDATE\_SECONDS.
* Added c.t.x.XStream.setCollectionUpdateLimit(int).
* Added c.t.x.core.SecurityUtils.
* Added c.t.x.security.AbstractSecurityException and c.t.x.security.InputManipulationException.
* c.t.x.security.InputManipulationException derives now from c.t.x.security.AbstractSecurityException.

# 1.4.18

Released August 22, 2021.

This maintenance release addresses following security vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with
an XStream instance using the default blacklist of an uninitialized security framework. XStream is therefore now
using a whitelist by default.

## Minor changes

* [#233](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/233): Support serializable types with non-serializable parent with PureJavaReflectionConverter.

## Stream compatibility

Starting with version 1.14.12 nine years ago, XStream contains a
[Security Framework](security.html#framework) to implement a black- or whitelist for the allowed types
at deserialization time. Until version 1.4.17, XStream kept a default blacklist in order to deny all types of the
Java runtime, which are used for all kinds of [security attacks](security.html#CVEs), in order to
guarantee optimal runtime compatibility for existing users. However, this approach has failed. The last months
have shown, that the Java runtime alone contains dozens of types that can be used for an attack, not even looking
at the 3rd party libraries on a classpath. The new version of XStream uses therefore now by default a whitelist,
which is recommended since nine years. It also has been complaining on the console for a long time about an
uninitialized security framework the first time it was run. Anyone who has followed the advice and initialized the
security framework for their own scenario can easily update to the new version without any problem. Everyone else
will have to do a proper initialization now, otherwise the new version will fail with certainty at deserialization
time.

# 1.4.17

Released May 13, 2021.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2021-29505](CVE-2021-29505.html), when unmarshalling with XStream instance using an uninitialized
security framework.

## Stream compatibility

* The following types are now blacklisted by default and the deserialization
  of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
  configuration, if you need them:
  + any type in the java.rmi.\* and sun.rmi.\* package hierarchies
  + the individual type com.sun.jndi.toolkit.dir.LazySearchEnumerationImpl

# 1.4.16

Released March 13, 2021.

This maintenance release switches XStream's default parser and addresses following security
vulnerabilities, when unmarshalling with an XStream instance using an uninitialized security framework.

## Major changes

* Switch from Xpp3 as default parser to MXParser, a fork of Xpp3.

## Minor changes

* [#238](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/238): Fix possibility to process references on enum types at deserialization.
* [#237](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/237): Fix optimization in XmlFriendlyNameCoder.

## Stream compatibility

* The following types are now blacklisted by default and the deserialization
  of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable these types by explicit
  configuration, if you need them:
  + the type hierarchies for java.io.InputStream, java.nio.channels.Channel,
    javax.activation.DataSource and javax.sql.rowsel.BaseRowSet
  + the individual types com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry,
    com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator,
    sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator, and sun.swing.SwingLazyValue
  + the individual types com.sun.corba.se.impl.activation.ServerTableEntry,
    com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment$NameProcessIterator,
    sun.awt.datatransfer.DataTransferer$IndexOrderComparator, and sun.swing.SwingLazyValue
  + the internal type Accessor$GetterSetterReflection of JAXB, the internal types
    MethodGetter$PrivilegedGetter and ServiceFinder$ServiceNameIterator of JAX-WS
  + all inner classes of javafx.collections.ObservableList
  + an internal ClassLoader used in a private copy of BCEL within the Java runtime

## Dependencies

The default parser of XStream has changed from the Xpp3Parser in artifact xpp3:xpp3\_min to MXParser, a fork of
Xpp3 in the artifact io.github.x-stream:mxparser. The Xpp3 is unmaintained for a long time, bugs have been fixed
reported more than a decade ago, improvements by other forks have been incorporated and some endless loops have
been fixed, that could have been utilized as DoS attack.

XStream has therefore new default dependencies. If you have used XStream with the default driver (i.e. Xpp3),
you can still exchange the XStream library for a drop-in replacement, but you will also have to remove the Xpp3 and
add the MXParser library instead.

For build time you will have to add the Xpp3 library to your dependencies, if you made explicitly use of the
Xpp3 driver. If you did explicitly use a different driver than Xpp3 and had therefore excluded the Xpp3
dependency, you might have to exclude now the new MXParser dependency instead to minimize your dependency list.

# 1.4.15

Released December 13, 2020.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerabilities
[CVE-2020-26258](CVE-2020-26258.html) and [CVE-2020-26259](CVE-2020-26259.html), when
unmarshalling with XStream instance using an uninitialized security framework.

## Minor changes

* [#226](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/226): XmlFriendlyNameCoder does not accept '9' as valid character in an XML name.
* [#228](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/228): DefaultMapper should handle IllegalArgumentException thrown by Class.forName().

## Stream compatibility

* The type jdk.nashorn.internal.objects.NativeString and the internal JAX-WS type ReadAllStream.FileStream
  are now part of the default blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail.
  You will have to enable these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.

## Delivery

Any XStream release can run with a minimal Java runtime environment of Java 1.4 as long as this environment will
process only requested classes of the jar file. Until version 1.4.14 XStream was delivered also as special Java 7
version for Android, because Dalvik scans all classes and fails at classes requiring a higher runtime version. However, this
special version will not work in a normal Java 8 environment or higher and was never meant do so.

Unfortunately, this version has to be build always after the standard version due to the build sequence. The
latest version in Maven Central however is always the one that has been deployed last independently from the time
of publishing. This creates an annoyance now in GitHub for any project using the Dependabot service which creates
automated pull requests with updates to the latest XStream version, because it injects now the special Java 7
version that probably breaks these projects.

Users who still require a special version for Java 7 will have to build this artifact now on their own. Users
for even older Java environments had always to do so anyway.

# 1.4.14

Released November 16, 2020.

This maintenance release addresses the security vulnerability
[CVE-2020-26217](CVE-2020-26217.html), reported originally as CVE-2017-9805 for Struts' XStream Plugin,
an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an uninitialized security
framework.

## Stream compatibility

* The types java.lang.ProcessBuilder and javax.imageio.ImageIO$ContainsFilter are now part of the default
  blacklist and the deserialization of XML containing one of the two types will fail. You will have to enable
  these types by explicit configuration, if you need them.

# 1.4.13

Released September 6, 2020.

## Major changes

* [#218](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/218): Defer reflective access to Java core modules.
* [#207](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/207): New predefined blacklist avoids vulnerability due to improper setup of the security framework.

# 1.4.12

Released April 12, 2020.

## Minor changes

* XmlFriendlyNameCoder supports now XML parsers implementing only 4th edition of XML 1.0 specification.
* Fix support of CDATA events in StAX.
* [#171](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/171): XStream.createObjectInputStream does not pass the DataHolder.
* [#151](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/151): Use of SPDX license identifier in POM and Manifest.
* [#152](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/152): Declare OSGi import of internal runtime packages as optional.
* Drop Require-Capability entry in manifest.

# 1.4.11.1

Released October 27, 2018.

## Hot fix

* [#133](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/133): XStream 1.4.11 fails to run on a Java Runtime < 8.

# 1.4.11

Released October 23, 2018.

This maintenance release addresses again the security vulnerability [CVE-2013-7285](CVE-2013-7285.html), an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling with XStream instances using an
uninitialized security framework. Only 1.4.10 uninitialized security framework was affected.

## Minor changes

* [#91](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/91), [#106](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/106): Clean-up data stacks in UnmarshallingContext implementations in case of exception (by
  Märt Bakhoff).
* [#2](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/2): Unneeded contention in DefaultConverterLookup.
* [#94](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/94): Fix PathConverter containing absolute Windows paths.
* [#105](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/105): XStream's ObjectInputStream returns wrong values for readUnsignedByte and readUnsignedShort.
* [XSTR-616](/jira/616) and [#93](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/93): Introduce StringCodec interface to support arbitrary Base64 codec
  implementations for EncodedByteArrayConverter. Prefer Base64 codec implementations of the Java runtime over
  XStream's own one.
* [#97](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/97): Support to run out of the box in a Java 1.4 runtime is established again.
* Provide methods in AbstractCollectionConverter that read and write in a balanced way from and to the
  hierarchical stream.
* New future-proof method JVM.isVersion to detect major version of Java runtime (incl. Java 10) as
  replacement for individual JVM.isXY methods.
* [#115](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/115): Dom4JDriver ignores character set of Dom4J configuration creating a Writer.
* [#116](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/116): Make converters null safe.
* [#123](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/issues/123) and [#124](https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/pull/124): Declare XPP dependencies for OSGi as optional.
* Add XppDriver.createDefaultParser for a simpler access to the default XmlPullParserFactory.
* Old BEA reference implementation of StAX is outdated, unmaintained and has security issues, therefore
  XStream's driver has been deprecated.
* Support for JaCoCo: FieldDictionary ignores synthetic fields starting with *$jacoco* as name.
* Add integration test for OSGi (by Wes Wannemacher).

## Stream compatibility

* The EncodedByteArrayConverter will now use an encoder by default that does no longer add line breaks as
  normally required by the RFC 1521 after 76 characters, making it also easier to use the converter for
  attributes. This will not affect XStream's Base64 decoder.

## API changes

  known exploits.

## Stream Compatibility

* The alias *duration* for type *javax.xml.datatype.Duration* has changed to *xml-duration*
  due to the support of the classes in the java.time package. *duration* is now used for type *java.time.Duration*.

# 1.4.7

Released February 8, 2014.

This maintenance release addresses mainly the security vulnerability [CVE-2013-7285](CVE-2013-7285.html), an arbitrary execution of commands when unmarshalling.

## Major changes

* Add [security framework](security.html#framework) to limit handled types while unmarshalling.
* java.bean.EventHandler no longer handled automatically because of severe security vulnerability.
* [XSTR-751](/jira/751): New SunLimitedUnsafeReflectionProvider that uses undocumented features only to allocate new
  instances as required on Dalvik.
* Fix instantiation of AnnotationMapper that requires ConverterLookup and ConverterRegistry to be the same
  instance.

## Minor changes

* XSTR-749: NPE if ReflectionConverter.canConvert(type) is called with null as argument.
* XSTR-753: NPE if SerializationConverter.canConvert(type) is called with an interface type as argument that
  extends Serializable.
* Add constructor to ReflectionConverter taking an additional type to create an instance that is dedicated to a
  specific type only.
* The ConverterLookup used by default cannot be casted to a ConverterRegistry anymore.

# 1.4.6

Released December 12, 2013.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-566](/jira/566) and [XSTR-200](/jira/200): Better compatibility with GAE and environments with active SecurityManager
  (i.e. in an Applet). XStream converters try now to ensure already in the canConvert methods that they can handle the
  requested type in practice and not only theoretically. Additionally the implementations even better take care, that
  the initialization of a converter will not break the setup of XStream itself. Following modifications have been done
  for these topics:
  + ReflectionConverter, SerializationConverter and LookAndFieldConverter will check if they can access the
    fields by reflection for a requested type.
  + SerializationConverter and ExternalizableConverter will check if they can create an instance of a derived
    OutputObjectStream first.
  + BeanProvider does no longer use reflection to locate default constructor.
  + AbstractAttributedCharacterIteratorAttributeConverter (and therefore TextAttributeConverter) will check
    first if it can access the possible constants of the type by reflection.
  + NoClassDefFoundError raised in GAE accessing the fields of restricted types by reflection will be handled.
  + StackTraceElementConverter uses constructor for StackTraceElement instances in Java 5 and GEA.
* [XSTR-739](/jira/739) and [XSTR-746](/jira/746): OrderRetainingMap fails if HashMap.putAll(Map) of Java Runtime is not
  implemented calling put for every element within the map.
* New NamedArrayConverter to define names of inner elements.

## Minor changes

* [XSTR-747](/jira/747): All constructors of StaxDriver derived classes take erroneously a XmlFriendlyNameCoder instead
  of a plain NameCoder.

## API changes

* Added c.t.x.converters.extended.NamedArrayConverter for free element names in arrays.
* Added constructors to c.t.x.io.xml.StandardStaxDriver taking NameCoder instead of XmlFriendlyNameCoder.
* Deprecated constructors of c.t.x.io.xml.StandardStaxDriver taking a XmlFriendlyNameCoder.
* Added constructors to c.t.x.io.xml.BEAStaxDriver taking NameCoder instead of XmlFriendlyNameCoder.

  ClassLoader can be instantiated due to security restrictions.
* [XSTR-691](/jira/691): Allow unknown XML elements to be ignored using new method XStream.ignoreUnknownElements.
* [XSTR-728](/jira/728): XStream creates invalid JSON with JsonHierarchicalStreamDriver for custom converters since
  XStream 1.4.
* [XSTR-300](/jira/300): New EnumToStringConverter to support custom string representations of Enum values.
* [XSTR-292](/jira/292) and [XSTR-405](/jira/405): New NamedMapConverter and NamedCollectionConverter to define names of inner
  elements.
* [XSTR-726](/jira/726): New annotation XStreamAliasType to support declarative definition of XStream.aliasType().
* [XSTR-735](/jira/735): Support for JDOM2 with JDom2Driver, JDom2Reader and JDom2Writer.
* Optimized XML structure for java.awt.Font.
* Fix: ToAttributedValueConverter silently appends fields without attribute support to the value producing
  mixed-mode XML.
* [XSTR-566](/jira/566) and [XSTR-249](/jira/249): Better compatibility with Google AppEngine and J2ME, setup no longer fails

* JettisonMappedXmlDriver provides better support to overwrite its create methods.
* [XSTR-685](/jira/685): StAX based drivers (StaxDriver and JettisonMappedXmlDriver) are not closing internal input
  stream reading from file or URL.
* [XSTR-736](/jira/736): XStream.unmarshal may throw NPE if version info of manifest is missing.
* [XSTR-733](/jira/733): Implicit elements that match multiple defined implicit collections will be assigned to the map
  with the nearest matching element type.

  Locale for the LocaleCategory.FORMAT is different to the global default Locale.
* [XSTR-578](/jira/578): Implement support for aliasing in JavaClasConverter, JavaFieldConverter and
  JavaMethodConverter. While it is not possible to enable this in general, new constructors have been added to these
  converters and an example in the acceptance tests (AliasTest).
* [XSTR-742](/jira/742): Register CompositeClassLoader in Java 7 as parallel capable.
* [XSTR-743](/jira/743): Support proxy collections of Hibernate Envers.

# 1.4.3

Released July 17, 2012.

## Major changes

* Support java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap with the MapConverter. This will also avoid a bug in JRockit
  JDK reported in [XSTR-608](/jira/608).
* [XSTR-699](/jira/699): Support for Hibernate 4 with XStream's Hibernate module as default for Java 6 or higher.

## Minor changes

  c.t.x.converters.reflection.ObjectAccessException and used instead when the unmarshalling process should write a
  field or property that is missing and does not exist.
* Added methods c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.peekElement(), c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.peekElement(int), and
  c.t.x.io.path.PathTracker.depth().
* Deprecated method c.t.x.core.ReferencingMarshallingContext.currentPath(). Wrong approach.

# 1.4.1

Released August 11, 2011.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-659](/jira/659): Use again Xpp3 as default parser, now with additional XmlPullParser API as regular dependency
  for the XPP factory. Only standard kXML2 package contains the XPP factory, but not the minimal kXML2 version.

## Minor changes

* Add utility class c.t.x.io.xml.xppdom.XppFactory and a path tracking comparator for XppDom.

# 1.4

Released August 6, 2011.

## Major changes

* Java 7 is detected and supported.
* [XSTR-542](/jira/542): The XppDriver uses now the official XmlPullParser API to locate an available parser using the

* [XSTR-553](/jira/553): Support annotations in Android.
* [XSTR-556](/jira/556): DateConverter uses format with 3-letter time zones that are ambiguous. Therefore it will now
  always use UTC to write dates. Unmarshalled dates are not affected as long as they contain a time zone.
* The type java.lang.reflect.Field is now handled by an own converter, that can still read the old format.
* [XSTR-490](/jira/490): Provide path in Converter for contexts that track the path.

  representation of an enum value.
* [XSTR-618](/jira/618): Add Oracle as vendor used for recent JRockit versions and former Sun JDK.
* [XSTR-656](/jira/656): DomReader and Dom4JReader do not escape attribute names retrieving their values.

# 1.3.1

Released December 6, 2008.

CGLIB support must be explicitly activated now. The decision has been made due to possible
problems using an own classloader and because of ongoing complaints about occurring exceptions in the
CGLIBEnhancedConverter at XStream initialization although they are caused by incompatible ASM versions on the user's
classpath ([XSTR-469](/jira/469), [XSTR-513](/jira/513) and [XSTR-518](/jira/518)).

XStream uses some attributes on its own. Until now it was possible to use
XStream.aliasAttribute to define a different name. This does still work but is deprecated for system attributes. Use
the new call XStream.aliasSystemAttribute for such an alias.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-515](/jira/515): CGLIB support is no longer activated automatically and has to be [explicitly turned on](faq.html#Serialization_CGLIB).
* [XSTR-448](/jira/448): Separated system attributes and user defined attributes for aliases.
* [XSTR-55](/jira/55): Ability to alias a package name.

* [XSTR-495](/jira/495): New PersistenceStrategy instead of StreamStrategy (based on the code and comments by Alexander
  Radzin).

## Minor changes

  with Jettison 1.0.
* [XSTR-493](/jira/493): Using attributes for fields with XML-unfriendly names results in NPE at deserialization.
* [XSTR-497](/jira/497): Unsafe operation with WeakHashMap can raise a NPE in Sun14ReflectionProvider.
* [XSTR-423](/jira/423): Support of CGLIB enhanced proxies with multiple callbacks if the proxy uses a factory (CGLIB
  default).
* [XSTR-536](/jira/536): XStream silently ignores unknown elements.
* [XSTR-503](/jira/503): Omitted properties in JavaBeans are requested at serialization (by Kevin Conaway).
* Fix possible memory leak in ObjectIdMap for JVMs that provide real distinct identity hash codes (happened on
  amd64 system).
* [XSTR-480](/jira/480): Aliasing of array types.
* [XSTR-515](/jira/515): The SubjectConverter and DurationConverter are only registered if the converted class is part
  of the JDK, otherwise they must be registered now explicitly.
* [XSTR-504](/jira/504): XmlHeaderAwareReader fails with improper sized PushbackInputStream.
* [XSTR-489](/jira/489): @XStreamConverter supports now also SingleValueConverter implementations.
* [XSTR-481](/jira/481): @XStreamConverter and @XStreamAsAttribute can be used together (as a result of [XSTR-489](/jira/489)).
* [XSTR-519](/jira/519): New annotation @XStreamInclude to force annotation detection of included types (by Seven
  Sparling).
* [XSTR-469](/jira/469): Support custom converters for enum types.
* [XSTR-502](/jira/502): ClassNotFoundException even if writeReplace returns proper object.
* [XSTR-529](/jira/529): NullPointerException for null elements in implicit lists.
* [XSTR-517](/jira/517): Miscellaneous performance improvements (by Tatu Saloranta).
* [XSTR-525](/jira/525): JsonHierarchicalStreamDriver writes invalid JSON in case of system attribute.
* [XSTR-535](/jira/535): Mode to allow plain values as result for JSON without root node.
* [XSTR-531](/jira/531): Possibility to omit system attributes.
* [XSTR-508](/jira/508): Fix marshalling error for nested serializable objects with own writeReplace/readResolve
  methods.
* [XSTR-507](/jira/507): Advanced ReferenceByIdMarshaller uses id of the current object if available.

* Fix classloader problem, Xpp3 parser cannot be loaded within a web application.
* Dependencies have been updated to latest versions of JDOM, Jettison, Joda Time, and Woodstox. Note for Maven
  builds that the *groupId* of JDOM has changed.
* Fix possible IndexOutOfBoundsException creating returning the message for a ConversionException.
* [XSTR-495](/jira/495): StreamStrategy cannot handle key with value *null*.

## API changes

* Deprecated c.t.x.io.json.JsonHierarchicalStreamWriter in favour of c.t.x.io.json.JsonWriter.
* c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper no longer derives from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper as it has been before version
  1.3. Therefore the new constructor has been deprecated in favour of the old one.
* c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String) has been deprecated in favour of
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String, Class) taking the type as third argument that should be
  handled by the converter.
* c.t.x.core.ReferenceByIdMarshaller.IdGenerator.next() has now the current object as argument.
* New c.t.x.persistence.PersistenceStrategy and c.t.x.persistence.FilePersistenceStrategy.
* Deprecated c.t.x.persistence.StreamStrategy and c.t.x.persistence.FileStreamStrategy.

# 1.3

Released February 27, 2008.

## Major changes

* ReflectionConverter writes now the fields of the parent classes first.
* Support for Converter definition at field level.
* Refactoring of Annotation support, invent auto-detection mode.
* Annotated converters are no longer detected automatically, all annotations are now handled in the same way.
* [XSTR-334](/jira/334): XStream will deserialize directly from a file or URL. Some parser take advantage of these
  objects to define a SystemId used to resolve further references in XML, schema or DTD. Appropriate createReader
  methods have been added to c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamDriver.
* [XSTR-261](/jira/261): All c.t.x.io.HierarchicalStreamDriver implementations respect now the encoding of an XML
  header if read from an InputStream.

## API changes

* c.t.x.annotation.Annotations, c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationReflectionConverter and
  c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationProvider deprecated. Functionality is integrated in new c.t.x.mapper.AnnotationMapper and
  accessible with new methods c.t.x.XStream.processAnnotations().
* New auto-detection mode for annotations, that can be turned on with c.t.x.XStream.autodetectAnnotations()
* c.t.x.annotation.@XStreamContainedType deprecated, the behaviour is now always active and the annotation
  therefore superfluous.
* Due to [XSTR-421](/jira/421) null characters are no longer written as tag with an attribute (<char
  null="true"/>), but as empty tag. The old representation is still supported at deserialization.
* Characters that are not defined in unicode or ISO control characters (expect TAB and LF) are written as
  numerical entity now.
* XPath references are now also XML-friendly encoded to match the path exactly. Unencoded references will
  normally work anyway, but in special cases the exact behaviour of XStream 1.2.x might be necessary. See acceptance
  tests for XStream 1.2.x compatibility.
* c.t.x.core.BaseException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.XStreamException as base exception for all exceptions
  XStream throws.
* c.t.x.XStream.InitializerException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.InitializerException.
* New methods get() and keys() in interface c.t.x.converter.ErrorWriter.
* c.t.x.mapper.XmlFriendlyMapper deprecated, technology is replaced since version 1.2 by
  c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReplacer as part of the different XmlWriter implementations.
* c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.aliasForAttribute() and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.attributeForAlias() deprecated, since it
  provided in reality the combined functionality of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.serializedMember()/realMember() and
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType().
* c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, Mapper, HierarchicalStreamDriver) deprecated, in favour of
  c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, HierarchicalStreamDriver, Mapper, ClassLoader).
* New interface c.t.x.converter.ConverterRegistry to express explicit functionality managing the converters.
* c.t.x.core.DefaultConverterLookup no longer uses a c.t.x.mapper.Mapper. Therefore the old constructor has
  been deprecated in favour of a default constructor.
* Overloaded methods of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType and
  c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute have been deprecated. Only one version has been kept, the
  implementation can handle all cases now at once and therefore multiple calls to the mapper chain are avoided.
* c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper derives now from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper to support enums as attributes.
  Therefore the old constructor has been deprecated in favour of one taking an additional
  c.t.x.converters.ConverterLookup that has to be passed to the new parent.

Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that
each converter can handle a null value in its marshalling methods. If you have implemented your own custom converters,
try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities in case XStream will provide such values with its next
major version.

# Version 1.2.2

Released May 24, 2007.

Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default. XStream emits
all fields in declaration order like Java serialization. But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
classes last while Java serialization emits them first. This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems. However, XStream itself will not be
affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
fine. Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour. In the
meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.

## Major changes

* [XSTR-391](/jira/391), Support for writing (and reading) JSON by the new JettisonMappedXmlDriver (by Dejan Bosanac).
* New FieldKeySorter interface allows a custom sort order of the XML elements.

  Nicolas Gros d'Aillon).
* Support raw bytes read from the ObjectInputStream.
* [XSTR-373](/jira/373), Support for Hitachi JVM (tested by Yuji Yamano).
* [XSTR-378](/jira/378) and [XSTR-379](/jira/379), Fix TextAttributeConverter and EnumSetConverter failing on Apache Harmony.

  by Andrea Aime).
* Ability to alias fields as well as classes, using XStream.addFieldAlias().
* [XSTR-70](/jira/70), [XSTR-204](/jira/204) Support for JDK 5 enums (contributed by Eric Snell and Bryan Coleman).
* [XSTR-206](/jira/206) Clean representation of JDK 5 EnumMap and EnumSet.

  HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer instances.

# Version 1.1.1

Released March 7, 2005. Mostly bugfixes and minor feature enhancements.

## Major changes

* Converters can be registered with a priority, allowing more *generic* filters to handle classes that
  don't have more specific converters.
* Converters can now access underlying HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer implementations to make implementation
  specific calls.
* Improved support for classes using ObjectInputFields to follow the serialization specification.
* [XSTR-179](/jira/179) Support for ObjectInputStream.registerValidation(ObjectInputValidation).
* [XSTR-178](/jira/178) Serialized inner class now maintains reference to outer class.

* Bugfix: Default implementations of aliased classes were not being deserialized by SerializableConverter.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-180](/jira/180) Serializable objects support defaultReadObject() even when no default fields available.
* Bugfix: For serialized objects class hierarchy is serialized starting with superclass (as per Java Object
  Serialization).
* Bugfix: readObject() is now called for classes containing only transient fields.
* Bugfix: Order of fields are maintained when calling ObjectOutputStream.putFields().
* Bugfix: FontConverter extended to support FontUIResource which does some awkward native calls.
* Bugfix: Deserialization of very complicated graphs (such as Swing components) sometimes resulted in broken
  object references. Now fixed.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-188](/jira/188) Classes that use readResolve()/writeReplace() can now return different types.
* Bugfix: [XSTR-185](/jira/185), [XSTR-195](/jira/195) Support for loading of array classes for classes that have not yet been
  loaded. (Thanks to Henri Tremblay and Simon Daniel)

## API changes

* ClassMapper is now deprecated. Replaced with MapperWrapper.
* HierarchicalStreamWriter implementations must now implement close(), flush() and underlyingWriter().
* HierarchicalStreamReader implementations must now implement close() and underlyingReader().

# Version 1.1

Released January 15, 2005. Focus on support for objects defining custom serialization using the standard [Java serialization](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html) mechanism.

## Major changes

* Provides drop in replacement for ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, using
  XStream.createObjectInputStream() and XStream.createObjectOutputStream() and XStream.createObjectInputStream(). This
  provides support for streaming objects.
* Support for objects that specify their own serialization schemes by implementing readObject() and
  writeObject() (as in Java serialization spec). This includes support for ObjectInputStream.getFields() and
  ObjectOuputStream.putFields().
* Support for objects to serialize other objects to the stream by implementing writeReplace() (as in Java
  serialization spec).
* Support for any object that performs custom serialization by implementing java.io.Externalizable (as in Java
  serialization spec).
* Implicit collections can be specified for classes, allowing the element wrapping the collection to be
  skipped.
* New writer implementations to allow XStream to serialize directly to a SAX stream or TrAX pipeline.
* The MarshallingContext and UnmarshallingContext interfaces now extend DataHolder, allowing arbitrary data to
  be stored by the user whilst walking the object graph and passed around to Converters. DataHolders can also be passed
  into XStream from the outside.
* Includes new DomWriter implementation to serialize directly to a W3C DOM tree (to complement the existing
  DomReader).
* Better support for instantiating objects on non Sun 1.4+ JVMs, including non-public constructors, private
  static inner classes and ANY class that implements java.io.Serializable.
* DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric-XML, SAX, STAX
* Specific ClassLoaders can be passed into XStream, to allow for greater compatibility in J2EE containers.
* Ability to change the default converter
* Added optional ISO8601DateConverter for full ISO8601 date format support. The converter is not registered by
  default as it requires the joda-time dependency (http://joda-time.sf.net). To use, ensure joda-time is in classpath
  and register explicitly.
* Enhanced mode is now supported on the Apple 1.4 JDK.

## Minor changes

* PrettyPrintWriter only flushes stream when necessary - large performance improvement for serialization.
* Added XStream.fromXml(xml, root) convenience methods for deserializing into an existing root object.
* JDK 1.3 compatibility: Added mechanism for accessing nested exception.
* JDK 1.3 compatibility: GregorianCalendarConverter only calls Calendar.getTimeInMillis() the JDK supports it.
* Bugfix: All caches are now synchronized - there were some thread safety issues.
* Bugfix: Only *immutable* basic types will have references ignored in XML (for clarity).
* Bugfix: Class names can contain underscores.
* Bugfix: Support for '\0' char.
* Bugfix: PropertyConverter no longer attempts to serialize subclasses of Properties.
* Bugfix: JVM detection uses system properties, which is more accurate than searching the classpath.

## API changes

* XStream.addDefaultCollection() has been deprecated. Use XStream.addImplicitCollection() instead.

# Version 1.0.2

Released August 7, 2004. Focus on improving the converters bundled with XStream to support a wider range of
types.

## Major changes

* XML elements are written in order they are defined in class, rather than alphabetical.
* Converters for java.io.File, java.sql.Timestamp, java.awt.Color, and dynamic proxies are now registered by
  default.
* EncodedByteArrayConverter is now registered by default and uses a single Base64 string to store the contents
  of a byte[]. This now works on all JVMs as it no longer relies on Sun specific classes. This converter will also
  unmarshal byte[] that have been serialized without it, for backwards compatability.
* New converters for java.sql.Time, java.sql.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.Currency, java.util.Calendar and
  java.awt.Font.
* All caching is done in XStream instance instead of statics, allowing applications that use hot redeployment
  of classes to use XStream in a parent classloader.
* XStream will fail fast if a field value is defined more than once in XML when deserializing.

## Minor changes

* The <entry> element used in Maps can now be specified by creating an alias for java.util.Map.Entry.
* Bugfix: Fields with characters that generate invalid XML (such as $ signs) are now escaped.
* Bugfix: Pre-instantiated objects can be unmarshalled through multiple levels.

## API changes

* None.

# Version 1.0.1

Released May 30, 2004. Misc features and bugfixes.

## Major changes

* Support for multidimensional arrays.
* Object with readResolve() method will be treated the same way native serialization treats them.

## Minor changes

* New converters for Throwable and StackTraceElement that retain stack trace (JDK 1.4 only)
* Bugfix: System.identityHashCode() is not guaranteed to be unique. Ensure reference checking is used as well.
* Bugfix: Allows user classes to be defined in WEB-INF/classes in Servlet environments. Tries to use context
  classloader if available.
* Support for java.util.Currency (through readResolve()).
* Instances of Jakarta Commons Lang Enum are now reused (through readResolve()).
* Bugfix: JavaClassConverter handles primitive type classes (contributed by Matthew Sandoz).

## API changes

  this new method.

# Version 1.0

Released May 14, 2004. Focusses on finalizing the API for 1.0 release.

## Major changes

* Supports fields of same name, hidden by inheritance.

## Minor changes

* JavaDoc for most important parts of API.

## API changes

* The ReflectionConverter and ReflectionProviders have had an overhaul to support hidden fields. Most methods
  now take an extra argument to specify which class a field is declared in.

# Version 1.0 (release candidate 1)

Released May 9, 2004. Focusses on finalizing the API for 1.0 release.

## Major changes

* JDK 1.3 compatibility.

* Defaults to using faster XPP based parser.
* Serializes final field under JDK 1.4.
* Fail fast when trying to serialize final field if not Sun 1.4 JRE.

## Minor changes

* Misc performance improvements.
* Converters for TreeMap and TreeSet that store the Comparator.

## API changes

* Default constructor for XStream class uses XppDriver instead of DomDriver. To use DomDriver, explicitly pass
  it in to the constructor.
* Exception is thrown if trying to serialize an object that contains a final field if not Sun 1.4 JRE.

[About XStream version numbers...](versioning.html)

# Version 0.6

Released May 7, 2004. Focusses on providing full object graph support.

## Major changes

* None.

## Minor changes

  Pomfret).
* Bugfix: DateConverter is now thread safe.
* Optimization: String instances are reused as much as possible.
* Converters for BigInteger and BigDecimal.
* IntConverter now recognises hexadecimal and octal notations (thanks to Konstantin Pribluda).

## API changes

* None.

# Version 0.6 (release candidate 1)

Released April 19, 2004. Focusses on providing full object graph support.

## Major changes

* Full support for object graphs, including duplicate references of same object and circular references.
* References can be identified using XPath (default), unique-IDs or disabled.

## Minor changes

* Release includes Ant build file.
* Converters for non standard collections such as Collections.EMPTY\_LIST, syncronizedList(), unmodifiableMap(),
  etc.
* Converter for nulls.
* Converter for dynamic proxies.
* Converter for java.net.URL.
* Converters for java.util.LinkedHashMap and java.util.LinkedHashSet.
* Converters for java.lang.reflect.Method and java.lang.reflect.Constructor.
* If duplicate reference support is disabled and a circular reference is encountered, an exception will be
  thrown.

## API changes

* None.

# Version 0.5

Released March 8, 2004. Focussed on performance.

## Major changes

* Massive performance improvements. Up to 3 times faster for serialization and 22 times faster for
  deserialization!
* Non-DOM building pull parser based reader. Results in much smaller memory footprint, particularly when
  deserializing large object models.

## Minor changes

* Misc performance improvements.
* Misc bugfixes.
* Alternate encodings can be used with DomDriver.

## API changes

* Renamed XMLReader/Writer to HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer as XStream is not actually coupled to serializing
  just to XML.
* Cleaned up the public API.
* Moved internal XStream implementation classes to core package.
* Misc package/class renames to make more sense. Dumped lots of dead code.

# Version 0.4

This version was never publicly released. All changes were made available in 0.5. Focussed on making it easier
to create custom converters.

## Major changes

* Overhaul of interface for Converters. Makes Converters much cleaner to write.

## Minor changes

* Added custom converters for java.io.File, java.util.Properties, java.util.Vector, java.util.Hashtable,
  java.util.BitSet byte[] (Base64 encoded), char[].
* Misc bugfixes.

## API changes

* New interface to be implemented by custom converters.

# Version 0.3

Released January 1, 2004.

## Major changes

* Added ElementMapper interface and default implementations to allow fine grained control over element name to
  class mapper operations.
* Added an XPP based reader and writer that uses a pull-parser to create a lightweight DOM tree.

## Minor changes

* Added XStream.fromXML(XMLReader xmlReader,Object root) method to allow the population of an object graph
  starting with a live object root.
* Added XMLReader.peek() method to allow access to the underlying hierarchical object being unmarshalled.

## API changes

* Aligned the the methods in XStream to use the specified ObjectFactory in the constructor instead of creating
  a SunReflectionObjectFactory.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 399 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2652714.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 74 new security patches for the Oracle E-Business Suite.  70 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle E-Business Suite products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Oracle E-Business Suite. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Oracle E-Business Suite Release 12 Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document (April 2020), [My Oracle Support Note 2650675.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2650675.1).

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  5 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2020verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2020 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2020 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2633852.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2633852.1).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

Starting with the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. Oracle has published two versions of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update Advisory: this version of the advisory implemented the change in how non-exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party components are reported, and the “traditional” advisory follows the same format as the previous advisories. The “traditional” advisory is published at <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020traditional.html>.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 403 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2712240.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Notes:

1. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not received over a network the CVSS score may be lower.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 329 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2739494.1).

**Please note that since the release of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle WebLogic Server: [CVE-2020-14750 (November 1, 2020)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2020-14750.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply this Critical Patch Update, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
