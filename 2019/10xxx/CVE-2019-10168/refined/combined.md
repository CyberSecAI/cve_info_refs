## Overview

A number of related vulnerabilities in the libvirt management API were recently discovered and fixed by the libvirt maintainers. These vulnerabilities expose unintended functionality to API clients with read-only permissions that could be used by the client to perform operations outside their normal sphere of permissions. The most severe vulnerability, with default configuration, could allow a read-only local API user to gain privilege escalation to root on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The issues have been assigned multiple CVEs, all considered [Important](https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification) severity: [CVE-2019-10161](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10161) [CVE-2019-10166](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10166) [CVE-2019-10167](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10167) [CVE-2019-10168](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10168)

## Background

Libvirtd is the daemon component of libvirt. It is responsible for managing the configuration and status of virtual machines and exposes an API over a Unix domain socket for clients such as virsh to manage those VMs.

Libvirt clients can connect in “privileged” read/write mode, or in “unprivileged” read-only mode. The read-only mode is supposed to only allow queries: a read-only client can interrogate libvirt about the VMs it manages, but to change configuration or state requires a read/write connection.

As the libvirt API has evolved over time, the line between “privileged” and “unprivileged” operations became less clear. API calls that were originally exposed read-only, gained more capabilities that made them more powerful, but introduced security risks that were not obvious at the time.

## Impact

This vulnerability is normally exposed to local users on the host where libvirtd is running (AV:L). Thus, multi-user Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems that host virtual machines are at the greatest risk.

Hypervisor hosts such as Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor typically do not support local users other than the administrator, so the impact in these environments is less severe.

Administrative changes made to `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf` may affect your level of exposure:

* If you have enabled the setting `listen_tcp`, network users that can reach the libvirt port may be able to conduct an attack.
* If access to libvirt is restricted by changing `unix_sock_ro_perms` to something more restrictive than `0777`, only those users able to `connect()` to the socket will be able to attack libvirtd. For example, the following allows only members of the `libvirt` group:

```
    unix_sock_group = "libvirt"
    unix_sock_ro_perms = "0770"

```

The potential impact an attack could achieve includes:

* Testing for the existence of files on the host as root. Libvirtd can be given an arbitrary path to read a saved state file, which it will attempt to read (CVE-2019-10161).
* Denial of service. By choosing particular paths in `/dev` or `/proc` with CVE-2019-10161, libvirtd could lock or interfere with other processes on the host.
* Privilege escalation to the “qemu” user. Libvirtd can be convinced to execute an attacker-specified binary, which will be invoked under the qemu user id. This could permit an attacker to start, stop, manipulate, or compromise other virtual machines managed by livbirt (all CVEs).
* Privilege escalation to “root” in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. In this version of libvirtd, the binary is also executed with `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE`, allowing it to read and write root-owned files.

The privilege escalation attacks are not possible on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, as that version of libvirt does not probe emulator capabilities by executing the binary. Only denial of service and testing for the existence of root-owned files are possible there.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is additionally vulnerable to privilege escalation attacks, but only to the “qemu” userid.

On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, full root compromise is possible due to use of the `CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE` capability flag.

## Diagnostics

If your system has a libvirtd process running as root, and has not had the below updates applied, it is vulnerable. On Red Hat Enterprise Linux, if you have the `libvirt-daemon` package installed, this process is started by default to enable the `qemu:///system` connection. You can check with any of the following commands:

```
    $ systemctl status libvirtd
    $ virsh -r -c qemu:///system list
    $ ls -l /var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock-ro

```
## Mitigation

Red Hat recommends updating your libvirt packages according to the table located in the affected products section.

Alternatively, access to the libvirt read-only socket can be restricted to root only, or to a trusted user group. This will impact monitoring of your virtual machines through the read-only socket, but management through the privileged socket will continue to work. To restrict access, edit the file `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf`:

| [Description](#c0)  Sam James   archtester Gentoo Infrastructure gentoo-dev Security  2020-03-02 11:28:40 UTC  ``` 1) CVE-2019-10161  Description: "It was discovered that libvirtd would permit read-only clients to use the virDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc() API, specifying an arbitrary path which would be accessed with the permissions of the libvirtd process. An attacker with access to the libvirtd socket could use this to probe the existence of arbitrary files, cause denial of service or cause libvirtd to execute arbitrary programs."  Bug: <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-10161>  2) CVE-2019-10166  Description: "It was discovered that libvirtd, versions 4.x.x before 4.10.1 and 5.x.x before 5.4.1, would permit readonly clients to use the virDomainManagedSaveDefineXML() API, which would permit them to modify managed save state files. If a managed save had already been created by a privileged user, a local attacker could modify this file such that libvirtd would execute an arbitrary program when the domain was resumed."  Bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10171>  3) CVE-2019-10167  Description: "The virConnectGetDomainCapabilities() libvirt API, versions 4.x.x before 4.10.1 and 5.x.x before 5.4.1, accepts an "emulatorbin" argument to specify the program providing emulation for a domain. Since v1.2.19, libvirt will execute that program to probe the domain's capabilities. Read-only clients could specify an arbitrary path for this argument, causing libvirtd to execute a crafted executable with its own privileges."  Bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10167>  4) CVE-2019-10168  Description: "The virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU() and virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU() libvirt APIs accept an "emulator" argument to specify the program providing emulation for a domain. Since v1.2.19, libvirt will execute that program to probe the domain's capabilities. Read-only clients could specify an arbitrary path for this argument, causing libvirtd to execute a crafted executable with its own privileges."  Bug: <https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1720118>  --- Advisory: <https://access.redhat.com/libvirt-privesc-vulnerabilities>  Impact for all: "The potential impact an attack could achieve includes:      Testing for the existence of files on the host as root. Libvirtd can be given an arbitrary path to read a saved state file, which it will attempt to read (CVE-2019-10161).     Denial of service. By choosing particular paths in /dev or /proc with CVE-2019-10161, libvirtd could lock or interfere with other processes on the host.     Privilege escalation to the “qemu” user. Libvirtd can be convinced to execute an attacker-specified binary, which will be invoked under the qemu user id. This could permit an attacker to start, stop, manipulate, or compromise other virtual machines managed by livbirt (all CVEs).     Privilege escalation to “root” in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. In this version of libvirtd, the binary is also executed with CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, allowing it to read and write root-owned files."   Versions affected: - <5.4.1 - <4.10.1 ```  [Comment 1](#c1)  Larry the Git Cow   gentoo-dev  2020-03-13 16:39:59 UTC  ``` The bug has been referenced in the following commit(s):  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=75352bea6963ac12faff5c565e2b9e19e8b19ef4>  commit 75352bea6963ac12faff5c565e2b9e19e8b19ef4 Author:     Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2020-03-13 15:39:24 +0000 Commit:     Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2020-03-13 16:29:40 +0000      app-emulation/libvirt: drop old          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/711306>     Package-Manager: Portage-2.3.93, Repoman-2.3.20     Signed-off-by: Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org>   app-emulation/libvirt/Manifest                |   4 -  app-emulation/libvirt/libvirt-5.2.0-r2.ebuild | 384 --------------------------  app-emulation/libvirt/libvirt-5.5.0-r1.ebuild | 379 -------------------------  app-emulation/libvirt/libvirt-5.6.0.ebuild    | 379 -------------------------  app-emulation/libvirt/libvirt-5.8.0.ebuild    | 383 -------------------------  app-emulation/libvirt/metadata.xml            |   3 -  6 files changed, 1532 deletions(-)  <https://gitweb.gentoo.org/repo/gentoo.git/commit/?id=4e8cc25768c10f6bca7167956ef6d7dbcc3ab90c>  commit 4e8cc25768c10f6bca7167956ef6d7dbcc3ab90c Author:     Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org> AuthorDate: 2020-03-13 15:36:46 +0000 Commit:     Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org> CommitDate: 2020-03-13 16:29:36 +0000      dev-python/libvirt-python: drop  old          Bug: <https://bugs.gentoo.org/711306>     Package-Manager: Portage-2.3.93, Repoman-2.3.20     Signed-off-by: Matthias Maier <tamiko@gentoo.org>   dev-python/libvirt-python/Manifest                 |  4 --  .../libvirt-python/libvirt-python-5.2.0.ebuild     | 47 ----------------------  .../libvirt-python/libvirt-python-5.5.0.ebuild     | 47 ----------------------  .../libvirt-python/libvirt-python-5.6.0.ebuild     | 47 ----------------------  .../libvirt-python/libvirt-python-5.8.0.ebuild     | 47 ----------------------  5 files changed, 192 deletions(-) ```  [Comment 2](#c2)  Thomas Deutschmann (RETIRED)   gentoo-dev  2020-03-15 02:37:44 UTC  ``` New GLSA request filed. ```  [Comment 3](#c3)  GLSAMaker/CVETool Bot   gentoo-dev  2020-03-15 02:44:28 UTC  ``` This issue was resolved and addressed in  GLSA 202003-18 at <https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-18> by GLSA coordinator Thomas Deutschmann (whissi). ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c0)  Doran Moppert    2019-06-13 07:54:32 UTC  ``` The virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU() and virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU() libvirt APIs accept an "emulator" argument to specify the program providing emulation for a domain.  Since v1.2.19, libvirt will execute that program to probe the domain's capabilities.  Read-only clients could specify an arbitrary path for this argument, causing libvirtd to execute a crafted executable with its own privileges.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c3)  Doran Moppert    2019-06-18 04:49:37 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Jan Tomko (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c7)  Hardik Vyas    2019-06-19 07:12:46 UTC  ``` Statement:  * This vulnerability requires access to the libvirt socket, normally in /var/run/libvirt/libvirt_sock_ro.  Typically in hypervisor environments, local user accounts are not supported so no untrusted users should be able to access this socket. * Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 is not affected by this vulnerability as libvirtd daemon is not shipped in Gluster.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c8)  Doran Moppert    2019-06-20 02:05:41 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://access.redhat.com/libvirt-privesc-vulnerabilities>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c9)  Doran Moppert    2019-06-20 02:05:44 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  The Unix permissions of libvirt's read-only socket can be made more restrictive than the default (0777) by editing `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf`.  The settings `unix_sock_group = libvirt` and `unix_sock_ro_perms = 0770` will restrict access to only members of `libvirt`, who already have management access to virtual machines.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c10)  Doran Moppert    2019-06-20 12:14:01 UTC  ``` Upstream patch:  <https://libvirt.org/git/?p=libvirt.git;a=commit;h=bf6c2830b6c338b1f5699b095df36f374777b291>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c11)  Doran Moppert    2019-06-20 12:14:26 UTC  ``` Created libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1722466](show_bug.cgi?id=1722466 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-10168 libvirt: arbitrary command execution via virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU and virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU APIs [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-libvirt tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1722469](show_bug.cgi?id=1722469 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2019-10168 mingw-libvirt: libvirt: arbitrary command execution via virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU and virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU APIs [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c12)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-20 15:33:30 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:1579 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1579](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1579)   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-06-20 15:48:28 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  Via RHSA-2019:1580 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1580](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1580)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-08 09:19:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Virtualization 4 for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7  Via RHSA-2019:1699 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1699](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1699)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-11 16:26:08 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Advanced Virtualization  Via RHSA-2019:1762 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1762](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1762)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1720118#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:07:47 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.
