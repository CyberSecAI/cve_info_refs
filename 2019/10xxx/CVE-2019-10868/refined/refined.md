Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10868:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing access validation within the Tryton application. Specifically, an authenticated user was able to order records based on a field they did not have the access rights to view.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing Access Control:** The core issue is the lack of proper access control checks when ordering records. The system allowed ordering operations on fields even if the user did not have the necessary permissions to view or access them.
- **Information Disclosure:** This vulnerability leads to information disclosure as it allows a user to infer values of fields they shouldn't have access to, based on the ordering of records.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:**  Exploitation results in the disclosure of information that is intended to be protected by access controls. Users can potentially discern values in fields that they are not authorized to access.
- **Limited Impact:** The impact is limited to confidentiality, with no impact on integrity or availability.  The CVSS v3.0 score reflects this, with a Confidentiality impact of Low and no impact for Integrity or Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Tryton system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the affected Tryton system.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Tryton server.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is fixed in Tryton versions 5.0.6, 4.8.10, 4.6.14, 4.4.19, and 4.2.21 and later versions. Users of affected versions are urged to upgrade to remediate the vulnerability.
