Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10423:

**CVE-2019-10423**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The CodeScan Plugin for Jenkins stored the API key unencrypted in the global configuration file on the Jenkins master.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**  The primary vulnerability is the storage of sensitive data (API key) in plain text within the plugin's global configuration file on the Jenkins controller. This lacks proper encryption or secure storage mechanisms.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker gaining access to the Jenkins master file system can read the plugin's configuration file and retrieve the plaintext API key. This exposed API key could be used to perform unauthorized actions or gain access to associated systems or services.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves gaining access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved through various means, including:
    *   Compromising the Jenkins server itself.
    *   Gaining unauthorized access to the underlying operating system.
    *   Exploiting other vulnerabilities that allow file system access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have at least read access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved through having compromised an account with sufficient privileges to access the filesystem. The attacker does not necessarily need Jenkins administrator privileges, just sufficient access to read the configuration file.
*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The affected configuration file is named `com.villagechief.codescan.jenkins.CodeScanBuilder.xml`.
    *   The plugin maintainers have not yet released a fix for this issue.

**Summary**

The vulnerability in the CodeScan Plugin exposes sensitive API keys due to their storage in plaintext on the Jenkins controller. This could allow unauthorized access and actions if an attacker gains access to the server's file system.
