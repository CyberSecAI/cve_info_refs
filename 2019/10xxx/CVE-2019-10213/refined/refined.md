Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of secret data written to pod logs within OpenShift Container Platform 4. Specifically, when the log level of an operator is set to "Debug" or higher, sensitive information is not properly scrubbed before being written to the logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Secret data is not sanitized before being written to pod logs, leading to its exposure.
- **Overly Verbose Logging:** When operators are set to a debug log level, more information including secrets, are logged. This results in secrets being written to logs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** A low-privileged user could potentially read pod logs and discover exposed secret material.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** An attacker with access to pod logs (even if low privileged) can view the logs for sensitive information.
- **Log Level Manipulation**: A privileged user has to set the log level to debug or higher for the vulnerability to be exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Pod Logs:** The attacker needs to have the ability to read pod logs. This could be a low-privileged user or an attacker who has compromised a system with access to these logs.
- **Debug log level set**: A privileged user must set the log level to debug for sensitive information to be exposed.
- **Knowledge of OpenShift logging**: Knowledge that OpenShift writes sensitive information to logs if the log level of the operator is set to "Debug" or higher.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was introduced by a specific change in the `openshift/library-go` repository.
- The vulnerability has been addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1 via multiple security advisories (RHSA-2019:2791, RHSA-2019:4082, and RHSA-2019:4088).
- The upstream fix for this issue is available.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
