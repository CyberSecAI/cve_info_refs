Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10471:

**CVE-2019-10471**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Libvirt Agents Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation. Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Missing Permission Check:** The plugin lacks proper authorization checks on a form validation method.
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The form validation method does not require POST requests.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can exploit this vulnerability to:
    *   Connect to an attacker-specified SSH server.
    *   Use attacker-specified credential IDs, potentially capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker can exploit the CSRF vulnerability by tricking a user with Overall/Read permissions into making a crafted request.
    *   The attacker needs to know the credential IDs beforehand, likely obtained through the related vulnerability CVE-2019-10473.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to Jenkins.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into making a crafted request, in order to exploit the CSRF vulnerability.
    *  The attacker also needs knowledge of valid credential IDs, likely obtained through CVE-2019-10473

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-10471 in the Libvirt Agents Plugin allows an attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to potentially capture credentials stored in Jenkins. This is achieved by exploiting a combination of a missing permission check and a CSRF vulnerability in a form validation method. The attacker can connect to an attacker-controlled SSH server using credentials obtained via another method (credential ID enumeration).
