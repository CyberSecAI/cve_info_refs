{
  "CVE-2019-10185": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a zip-slip attack during the auto-extraction of JAR files in IcedTea-web.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability in the auto-extraction of nested JAR files.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations, potentially replacing the main running application and breaking out of the sandbox.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the auto-extraction feature of IcedTea-web when processing a malicious JAR file.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker requires the ability to provide a malicious JAR file to IcedTea-web, either through a man-in-the-middle attack or by hosting a modified JNLP file."
  },
  "CVE-2019-10182": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists due to improper sanitization of paths from <jar/> elements in JNLP files.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability when processing the href attribute of the jar node.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, leveraging a crafted JNLP file with a malicious <jar/> element.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to influence the JNLP file loaded by IcedTea-web. This could be achieved through a man-in-the-middle attack or by hosting a modified JNLP file."
    },
  "CVE-2019-10181": {
     "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by the fact that IcedTea-web considers a JAR archive fully signed even when unsigned class files are present in the META-INF folder.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unsigned code injection vulnerability in a signed JAR file, where code can be injected into the META-INF folder without detection by signature verification.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject code into a trusted JAR file, which will be executed within the Java sandbox.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is network-based, where a malicious JAR file with injected code in the META-INF folder is provided to the IcedTea-web.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious JAR file which IcedTea-web will process. This could involve a man-in-the-middle attack or control over the server hosting the JAR."
