The provided content shows two commits related to fixing XSS vulnerabilities in the `totaljs/cms` repository.

**Commit 75205f9:**
*   **Root Cause:** The grid component was rendering values directly without encoding them, leading to potential XSS.
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability in the `COMPONENT('grid')` where values from `items[i][column.name]` were being rendered without encoding.
*   **Fix:** Introduced `Thelpers.encode()` to sanitize values before rendering in the grid component. Specifically, the line `m.value = column.template ? column.template(items[i], column) : column.render ? column.render(val, column, items[i]) : val == null ? '' : (column.format ? val.format(column.format) : val);` was changed to `m.value = column.template ? column.template(items[i], column) : column.render ? column.render(val, column, items[i]) : val == null ? '' : Thelpers.encode((column.format ? val.format(column.format) : val));`
*   **Impact:** Potential XSS attacks via crafted data in the grid.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious data injected through the `items` array displayed in the grid component.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to control the data that is being displayed in the grid component.

**Commit 8b9d7da:**
*   **Root Cause:** Notification messages were rendered directly without encoding, potentially leading to XSS.
*   **Vulnerability:** XSS vulnerability where notification messages were not being encoded before display.
*   **Fix:** Introduced `Thelpers.encode()` to sanitize notification messages before rendering. The line `if (item.message)`  was followed by `item.message = Thelpers.encode(item.message);`
*   **Impact:** Potential XSS attacks via crafted notification messages.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious data injected through the `item.message` in notifications.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to control the content of notification messages.

Both commits address XSS vulnerabilities by encoding user-provided data before rendering it in the UI, using `Thelpers.encode()`.
