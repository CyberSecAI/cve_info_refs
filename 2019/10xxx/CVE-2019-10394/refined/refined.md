Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10394:

**CVE-2019-10394**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Script Security Plugin had insufficient sandbox protection when handling crafted property names in property expressions on the left-hand side of assignment expressions.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Sandbox bypass: The plugin failed to properly sanitize or validate crafted property names within assignment expressions, allowing for the circumvention of the sandbox.
    *   Inadequate Input Validation: The plugin did not sufficiently restrict the characters or structure of property names used in assignment expressions.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution: Attackers could execute arbitrary code within the context of the Jenkins controller JVM. This could lead to complete compromise of the Jenkins server and its connected infrastructure.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sandboxed Scripts: Attackers could inject malicious code through sandboxed scripts that they are able to specify and run.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to specify and run sandboxed scripts: The attacker needs to be able to define and execute sandboxed scripts within the Jenkins environment. This is usually possible if the user has job configuration or build permissions or if there is an exposed API to execute scripts.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory mentions that crafted property names in property expressions were the attack vector, specifically when those expressions were on the left-hand side of assignment operations.
*   The issue was addressed by applying sandbox protection to these expressions, which would mean some sanitization or validation has been implemented.
*   This vulnerability is one of four sandbox bypass issues addressed in the same advisory, along with CVE-2019-10393, CVE-2019-10399 and CVE-2019-10400. All of them affect the Script Security plugin, and have the same ultimate impact, which is arbitrary code execution in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.
