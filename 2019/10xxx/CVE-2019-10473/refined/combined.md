As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (1) / CVE-2019-10471 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10472 (permission check)
Libvirt Slaves Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (2) / CVE-2019-10473
Libvirt Slaves Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1073 / CVE-2019-10474
Global Post Script Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
permission to list the files contained in $JENKINS_HOME/global-post-script
that can be used by the plugin.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1490 / CVE-2019-10475
build-metrics Plugin does not properly escape the label query parameter,
resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

Add libvirt hypervisor agent support to Jenkins

Libvirt Agents 1.8 uses a newer libvirt java binding. If you are upgrading from an earlier version of this plugin, you will have to reconfigure your hypervisor settings and thus also all libvirt-controlled nodes!

The least painful approach (especially for larger setups) is to properly set up the Hypervisor first, followed by editing each node, pointing it to the reconfigured Hypervisor. It is not necessary to delete node configurations!

See the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/jenkinsci/libvirt-agent-plugin/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for a list of released versions.

### Description

This plugin for Jenkins CI adds a way to control guest domains hosted on Xen or QEMU/KVM. You configure a Jenkins Agent, selecting the guest domain and hypervisor. When you need to build a job on a specific Agent, its guest domain is started, then the job is run. When the build process is finished, the guest domain is shut down, ready to be used again as required.

### Requirements

For a communication with Hypervisors you need to install **libvirt** library on Jenkins machine. This plugin comes with libvirt java binding, but is just an interface to the "real" C libvirt library. In your distribution you should have a package to install libvirt (ie *yum install libvirt* on RedHat/Fedora/Centos distributions).

### Configuration

##### Hypervisor

The first step is the Hypervisor configuration. To create a new Hypervisor you need to add a new "Cloud" in the Jenkins "Manage Jenkins" menu.

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/libvirt-agent-plugin@master/docs/images/hypervisor-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/libvirt-agent-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/hypervisor-config.png)

The required parameters to setup are:

* **Hypervisor Type**: The Hypervisor you have in your system
* **Hypervisor Transport**: Remote transport for a libvirtd. Use libssh or libssh2 with Jenkins username/password credentials.
* **Hypervisor Host**: Hostname or IP address to contact your hypervisor
* **Username**: Username to use for connection
* **Port**: The TCP connection port. Each transport has a default.
* **URI parameter**: By default xen and kvm expose the control API using *system*. If, for any reasons, you don't have this default value or need to provide further parameters, you can set them here
* **Concurrent Agents Capacity**: If you are running a setup where agents are being shut down once they are idling and you want to control how many concurrent agents can be run by Jenkins on the particular hypervisor, you can set this threshold here. Providing 0, the default value, disables the threshold. Please note that a threshold will not fail build jobs, Jenkins will simply reissue the agent commissioning once the hypervisor is again running below its threshold, thus delaying the start up of agents

Here an example of connection string will be used by Libvirt Agents Plugin to create a connection with the hypervisor:

```
 xen+ssh://username@hostname:port/system

```

you can test your connection typing, from your Jenkins Server:

```
 virsh connect xen+ssh://username@hostname:port/system

```

To verify all your parameters you can click on *Test Connection* button and check the output reported.

##### Agents

Now you can setup your nodes in Jenkins and use them to build your projects.

Once the node is created, you'll see the configuration page as shown below:

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/libvirt-agent-plugin@master/docs/images/node-config.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/libvirt-agent-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/node-config.png)

Here you can configure the following details:

* **Hypervisor**: Select one of the clouds that you configure at the central Configure Jenkins page
* **Virtual Machine**: Select one of the virtual machines that you want to use as an agent
* **Revert Snapshot**: Optionally, you can select an existing snapshot of the virtual machine that you want the agent to be reverted to once it is being shut down
* **Startup Idle**: This optional value (default is 60) allows you to specify an idle timer in seconds. Once the virtual machine has been started, Jenkins will wait that long before starting the actual agent service on the virtual host. If your hypervisor is super quick, set a low value, if it takes a while to get that VM up, increase the timer.
