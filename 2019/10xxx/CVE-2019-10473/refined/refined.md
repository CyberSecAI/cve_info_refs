Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10473:

**CVE-2019-10473**

*   **Root Cause:** The Libvirt Agents Plugin does not properly check permissions when providing a list of applicable credential IDs.
*   **Weakness:** Missing permission check on a method that provides a list of credential IDs.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with Overall/Read access can obtain a list of valid credential IDs. This list can be used to further exploit other vulnerabilities and potentially capture credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access to the Jenkins instance.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.

**Summary:**
The Libvirt Agents Plugin allowed any user with Overall/Read permission to enumerate valid credential IDs due to a missing permission check. This vulnerability, when combined with another vulnerability, can lead to the capture of stored credentials.
