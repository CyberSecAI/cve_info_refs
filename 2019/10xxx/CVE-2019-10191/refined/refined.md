Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10191:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is improper input validation in the DNS resolver component of Knot Resolver. Specifically, the resolver doesn't correctly validate negative DNS responses, which can be exploited to poison the DNS cache.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of negative DNS answers (NXDOMAIN). This allows an attacker to inject forged responses.
- **Cache Poisoning:** Due to the improper validation, the resolver can cache unsigned negative answers with forged QNAME+QTYPE, leading to cache poisoning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **DNSSEC Downgrade:** A remote attacker can downgrade DNSSEC-secure domains to a DNSSEC-insecure state.
- **Domain Hijacking:**  By making the resolver believe that a domain doesn't exist or redirecting it to a malicious server, the attacker can perform domain hijacking attacks against the insecure DNS protocol.
- **Cache Poisoning:** An attacker can inject malicious data into the DNS cache of the resolver.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector is sending specially crafted DNS responses to a vulnerable Knot Resolver instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send DNS responses to the targeted Knot Resolver. They don't necessarily need to be on the same network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Knot Resolver versions before 4.1.0.
*   The fix involves preventing the caching of negative answers with forged QNAME+QTYPE.
*   This vulnerability is related to, but distinct from CVE-2019-10190, which allows bypassing DNSSEC validation for non-existence answers.
*   The issue affects community products and is not directly related to commercially supported Red Hat products
