# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-05-23 16:13:36 UTC  ``` OpenShift builds don't seem to cache the SSH key of the git repository. This allows an attacker who can MiTM, take over DNS etc to supply their own content.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c1)  Dave Baker    2019-05-23 16:21:04 UTC  ``` Created repro; confirmed against 3.9, 3.11 and 4.1 rc5.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c2)  Dave Baker    2019-05-23 16:31:22 UTC  ``` Tracked to scmauth/sshkey.go within builder.  Link here is for 3.11  <https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/release-3.11/pkg/build/builder/cmd/scmauth/sshkey.go#L26-L28>  	content := "#!/bin/sh\nssh -i " + 		filepath.Join(baseDir, SSHPrivateKeyMethodName) + 		" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false \"$@\"\n"   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c3)  Dave Baker    2019-05-23 16:47:55 UTC  ``` Flagging 3.6 and later as all affected from observation of source code.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c8)  Marian Rehak    2019-05-29 12:29:35 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: @l14n_uk   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c9)  Dave Baker    2019-05-29 20:25:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  OpenShift Container Platform allows for various types of "source clone secrets" to be defined in order to permit building from non-public git repositories.  When using ssh key authentication, the server host key checking function is disabled.  An attacker with the ability to redirect the network traffic and perform a "man in the middle" attack will be able to redirect the build job to use arbitrary content of their choosing.  Note that the same flaw (non-verification of remote server) is present when using HTTP, or when using HTTPS with TLS verification manually disabled.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c10)  Dave Baker    2019-05-29 20:25:05 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.html#source-secrets-ssh-key-authentication>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c11)  Dave Baker    2019-05-29 20:25:06 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use only methods (such as HTTPS with TLS verification) that enable the identity of the remote repository to be validated.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c12)  Dave Baker    2019-05-30 00:07:19 UTC  ``` Updating CVSS to align to other MITM style flaws. - MITM can be performed through many means (DNS redirection, traffic redirection, etc), leading to a complex attack. - Attacking user needs no local privs on the cluster, and with MITM abilities can observe traffic requests in order to construct their attack. - Scope is unchanged - whatever permissions in the cluster the builder pod has, they remain the same with the altered build content.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c14)  Dave Baker    2019-05-30 00:12:52 UTC  ``` Created origin tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1715256](show_bug.cgi?id=1715256 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-10150 origin: atomic-openshift: OpenShift builds don't verify SSH Host Keys for the git repository [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-14 08:48:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.10  Via RHSA-2019:2989 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2989](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2989)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c25)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-10-14 12:51:19 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1737651#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-05 23:59:58 UTC  ``` A third issue was discovered with the Kubernetes `kubectl cp` command that could enable a directory traversal such that a malicious container could replace or create files on a user’s workstation. The vulnerability is a client-side defect and requires user interaction to be exploited.  This vulnerability allows a malicious container to cause a file to be created or replaced on the client computer when the client uses the `kubectl cp` operation.

## How Build Inputs Work

A *build input* provides source content for builds to operate on. There are
several ways to provide source in OpenShift Container Platform. In order of precedence:

* [Inline Dockerfile definitions](#dockerfile-source)
* [Content extracted from existing images](#image-source)
* [Git repositories](#source-code)
* [Binary (Local) inputs](#binary-source)
* [Input secrets and ConfigMaps](#using-secrets-during-build)
* [External artifacts](#using-external-artifacts)

Different inputs can be combined into a single build.
As the inline Dockerfile takes
precedence, it can overwrite any other file named ***Dockerfile*** provided by
another input.
Binary (local) input and Git repositories are mutually exclusive inputs.

Input secrets are useful for when you do not want certain resources or
credentials used during a build to be available in the final application image
produced by the build, or want to consume a value that is defined in a `Secret`
resource. External artifacts can be used to pull in additional files that are
not available as one of the other build input types.

Whenever a build is run:

1. A working directory is constructed and all input content is placed in the
   working directory. For example, the input Git repository is cloned into the
   working directory, and files specified from input images are copied into the
   working directory using the target path.
2. The build process changes directories into the `contextDir`, if one is
   defined.
3. The inline Dockerfile, if any, is written to the current directory.
4. The content from the current directory is provided to the build process
   for reference by the
   Dockerfile, custom builder logic, or
   ***assemble*** script. This means any input content that resides outside the
   `contextDir` will be ignored by the build.

The following example of a source definition includes multiple input types and
an explanation of how they are combined. For more details on how each input type
is defined, see the specific sections for each input type.

```
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git (1)
  images:
  - from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: myinputimage:latest
      namespace: mynamespace
    paths:
    - destinationDir: app/dir/injected/dir (2)
      sourcePath: /usr/lib/somefile.jar
  contextDir: "app/dir" (3)
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" (4)
```

| **1** | The repository to be cloned into the working directory for the build. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | ***/usr/lib/somefile.jar*** from `myinputimage` will be stored in ***<workingdir>/app/dir/injected/dir***. |
| **3** | The working directory for the build will become ***<original\_workingdir>/app/dir***. |
| **4** | A Dockerfile with this content will be created in ***<original\_workingdir>/app/dir***, overwriting any existing file with that name. |

## Dockerfile Source

When a `dockerfile` value is supplied, the content of this field
will be written to disk as a file named ***Dockerfile***. This is
done after other input sources are processed, so if the input
source repository contains a ***Dockerfile*** in the root directory,
it will be overwritten with this content.

The typical use for this field is to provide a `Dockerfile` to a
[Docker
strategy](../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build) build.

The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:

```
source:
  dockerfile: "FROM centos:7\nRUN yum install -y httpd" (1)
```

| **1** | The `dockerfile` field contains an inline Dockerfile that will be built. |
| --- | --- |

## Image Source

Additional files can be provided to the build process via images. Input images
are referenced in the same way the `From` and `To` image targets are defined.
This means both container images and
[image
stream tags](../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#image-stream-tag) can be referenced. In conjunction with the image, you must provide
one or more path pairs to indicate the path of the files or directories to copy
the image and the destination to place them in the build context.

The source path can be any absolute path within the image specified. The
destination must be a relative directory path. At build time, the image will be
loaded and the indicated files and directories will be copied into the context
directory of the build process. This is the same directory into which the source
repository content (if any) is cloned. If the source path ends in ***/.*** then
the content of the directory will be copied, but the directory itself will not
be created at the destination.

Image inputs are specified in the `source` definition of the `BuildConfig`:

```
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world.git
  images: (1)
  - from: (2)
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: myinputimage:latest
      namespace: mynamespace
    paths: (3)
    - destinationDir: injected/dir (4)
      sourcePath: /usr/lib/somefile.jar (5)
  - from:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: myotherinputimage:latest
      namespace: myothernamespace
    pullSecret: mysecret (6)
    paths:
    - destinationDir: injected/dir
      sourcePath: /usr/lib/somefile.jar
```

| **1** | An array of one or more input images and files. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | A reference to the image containing the files to be copied. |
| **3** | An array of source/destination paths. |
| **4** | The directory relative to the build root where the build process can access the file. |
| **5** | The location of the file to be copied out of the referenced image. |
| **6** | An optional secret provided if credentials are needed to access the input image. |

|  | This feature is not supported for builds using the [Custom Strategy](#using-secrets-custom-strategy). |
| --- | --- |

## Git Source

When specified, source code will be fetched from the location supplied.

If an inline Dockerfile is supplied, it will overwrite the ***Dockerfile***
(if any) in the `contextDir` of the Git repository.

The source definition is part of the `spec` section in the `BuildConfig`:

```
source:
  git: (1)
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    ref: "master"
  contextDir: "app/dir" (2)
  dockerfile: "FROM openshift/ruby-22-centos7\nUSER example" (3)
```

| **1** | The `git` field contains the URI to the remote Git repository of the source code. Optionally, specify the `ref` field to check out a specific Git reference. A valid `ref` can be a SHA1 tag or a branch name. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | The `contextDir` field allows you to override the default location inside the source code repository where the build looks for the application source code. If your application exists inside a sub-directory, you can override the default location (the root folder) using this field. |
| **3** | If the optional `dockerfile` field is provided, it should be a string containing a Dockerfile that overwrites any Dockerfile that may exist in the source repository. |

If the `ref` field denotes a pull request, the system will use a `git fetch` operation
and then checkout `FETCH_HEAD`.

When no `ref` value is provided, OpenShift Container Platform performs a shallow clone
(`--depth=1`). In this case, only the files associated with the most recent
commit on the default branch (typically `master`) are downloaded. This results
in repositories downloading faster, but without the full commit history. To
perform a full `git clone` of the default branch of a specified repository, set
`ref` to the name of the default branch (for example `master`).

### Using a Proxy

If your Git repository can only be accessed using a proxy, you can define the
proxy to use in the `source` section of the `BuildConfig`. You can configure
both a HTTP and HTTPS proxy to use. Both fields are optional. Domains for which
no proxying should be performed can also be specified via the **NoProxy** field.

|  | Your source URI must use the HTTP or HTTPS protocol for this to work. |
| --- | --- |

```
source:
  git:
    uri: "https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world"
    httpProxy: http://proxy.example.com
    httpsProxy: https://proxy.example.com
    noProxy: somedomain.com, otherdomain.com
```

Cluster administrators can also
[configure
a global proxy for Git cloning using Ansible](../../install_config/http_proxies.html#configuring-hosts-for-proxies-using-ansible).

|  | For Pipeline strategy builds, given the current restrictions with the Git plug-in for Jenkins, any Git operations through the Git plug-in will not leverage the HTTP or HTTPS proxy defined in the `BuildConfig`. The Git plug-in only will use the proxy configured in the Jenkins UI at the Plugin Manager panel. This proxy will then be used for all git interactions within Jenkins, across all jobs. You can find instructions on how to configure proxies through the Jenkins UI at [JenkinsBehindProxy](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/JenkinsBehindProxy). |
| --- | --- |

### Source Clone Secrets

Builder pods require access to any Git repositories defined as source for a
build. Source clone secrets are used to provide the builder pod with access it
would not normally have access to, such as private repositories or repositories
with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.

The following source clone secret configurations are supported.

* [***.gitconfig*** File](#source-secrets-gitconfig-file)
* [Basic Authentication](#source-secrets-basic-authentication)
* [SSH Key Authentication](#source-secrets-ssh-key-authentication)
* [Trusted Certificate Authorities](#source-secrets-trusted-certificate-authorities)

|  | You can also use [combinations](#source-secrets-combinations) of these configurations to meet your specific needs. |
| --- | --- |

Builds are run with the **builder** service account, which must have access to any
source clone secrets used. Access is granted with the following command:

```
$ oc secrets link builder mysecret
```

|  | Limiting secrets to only the service accounts that reference them is disabled by default. This means that if `serviceAccountConfig.limitSecretReferences` is set to `false` (the default setting) in the master configuration file, linking secrets to a service is not required. |
| --- | --- |

#### Automatically Adding a Source Clone Secret to a Build Configuration

When a `BuildConfig` is created, OpenShift Container Platform can automatically populate its
source clone secret reference. This behaviour allows the resulting `Builds` to
automatically use the credentials stored in the referenced `Secret` to
authenticate to a remote Git repository, without requiring further
configuration.

To use this functionality, a `Secret` containing the Git repository credentials
must exist in the namespace in which the `BuildConfig` will later be created.
This `Secret` must additionally include one or more annotations prefixed with
`build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-`. The value of each of these
annotations is a URI pattern, defined as follows. When a `BuildConfig` is created
without a source clone secret reference and its Git source URI matches a URI
pattern in a `Secret` annotation, OpenShift Container Platform will automatically insert a
reference to that `Secret` in the `BuildConfig`.

A URI pattern must consist of:

* a valid scheme (`*://`, `git://`, `http://`, `https://` or `ssh://`).
* a host (`*` or a valid hostname or IP address optionally preceded by `*.`).
* a path (`/*` or `/` followed by any characters optionally including `*`
  characters).

In all of the above, a `*` character is interpreted as a wildcard.

|  | URI patterns must match Git source URIs which are conformant to [RFC3986](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt). Do not include a username (or password) component in a URI pattern.   For example, if you use `ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/ATLASSIAN/jira.git` for a git repository URL, the source secret must be specified as `ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*` (and not `ssh://git@bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*`).  ``` $ oc annotate secret mysecret \     'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=ssh://bitbucket.atlassian.com:7999/*' ``` |
| --- | --- |

If multiple `Secrets` match the Git URI of a particular `BuildConfig`,
OpenShift Container Platform will select the secret with the longest match. This allows for
basic overriding, as in the following example.

The following fragment shows two partial source clone secrets, the first
matching any server in the domain `mycorp.com` accessed by HTTPS, and the second
overriding access to servers `mydev1.mycorp.com` and `mydev2.mycorp.com`:

```
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: matches-all-corporate-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://*.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...

kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: override-for-my-dev-servers-https-only
  annotations:
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1: https://mydev1.mycorp.com/*
    build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-2: https://mydev2.mycorp.com/*
data:
  ...
```

Add a `build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-` annotation to a pre-existing
secret using:

```
$ oc annotate secret mysecret \
    'build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1=https://*.mycorp.com/*'
```

#### Manually Adding Source Clone Secrets

Source clone secrets can be added manually to a build configuration by adding a
`sourceSecret` field to the `source` section inside the `BuildConfig` and
setting it to the name of the `secret` that you created (`basicsecret`, in this
example).

```
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "BuildConfig"
metadata:
  name: "sample-build"
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: "ImageStreamTag"
      name: "sample-image:latest"
  source:
    git:
      uri: "https://github.com/user/app.git"
    sourceSecret:
      name: "basicsecret"
  strategy:
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: "ImageStreamTag"
        name: "python-33-centos7:latest"
```

|  | You can also use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the source clone secret on an existing build configuration:  ``` $ oc set build-secret --source bc/sample-build basicsecret ``` |
| --- | --- |

[Defining Secrets in the BuildConfig](#using-secrets-in-the-buildconfig) provides more information on this topic.

#### .gitconfig File

If the cloning of your application is dependent on a ***.gitconfig*** file,
then you can create a secret that contains it, and then add
it to the builder service account, and then your `BuildConfig`.

To create a secret from a ***.gitconfig*** file:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> --from-file=<path/to/.gitconfig>
```

|  | SSL verification can be turned off if `sslVerify=false` is set for the `http` section in your ***.gitconfig*** file:  ``` [http]         sslVerify=false ``` |
| --- | --- |

#### .gitconfig File for Secured Git

If your Git server is secured with 2-way SSL and user name with password
you must add the certificate files to your source build and add references to
the certificate files in the ***.gitconfig*** file:

1. Add the ***client.crt***, ***cacert.crt***, and ***client.key*** files to the
   ***/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/*** folder in the
   [application
   source code](../../dev_guide/application_lifecycle/new_app.html#specifying-source-code).
2. In the ***.gitconfig*** file for the server, add the `[http]` section
   shown in the following example:

   ```
   # cat .gitconfig
   [user]
           name = <name>
           email = <email>
   [http]
           sslVerify = false
           sslCert = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.crt
           sslKey = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.key
           sslCaInfo = /var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/cacert.crt
   ```
3. Create the secret:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
   --from-literal=username=<user_name> \ (1)
   --from-literal=password=<password> \ (2)
   --from-file=.gitconfig=.gitconfig \
   --from-file=client.crt=/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.crt \
   --from-file=cacert.crt=/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/cacert.crt \
   --from-file=client.key=/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/source/client.key
   ```

   | **1** | The user’s Git user name. |
   | --- | --- |
   | **2** | The password for this user. |

|  | To avoid having to enter your password again, be sure to specify the S2I image in your builds. However, if you cannot clone the repository, you still need to specify your user name and password to promote the build. |
| --- | --- |

#### Basic Authentication

Basic authentication requires either a combination of `--username` and
`--password`, or a `token` to authenticate against the SCM server.

Create the `secret` first before using the user name and password to access the
private repository:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
    --from-literal=username=<user_name> \
    --from-literal=password=<password> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```

To create a basic authentication secret with a token:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
    --from-literal=password=<token> \
    --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
```

#### SSH Key Authentication

SSH key based authentication requires a private SSH key.

The repository keys are usually located in the ***$HOME/.ssh/*** directory, and
are named `id_dsa.pub`, `id_ecdsa.pub`, `id_ed25519.pub`, or `id_rsa.pub` by
default. Generate SSH key credentials with the following command:

```
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
```

|  | Creating a passphrase for the SSH key prevents OpenShift Container Platform from building. When prompted for a passphrase, leave it blank. |
| --- | --- |

Two files are created: the public key and a corresponding private key (one of
`id_dsa`, `id_ecdsa`, `id_ed25519`, or `id_rsa`). With both of these in place,
consult your source control management (SCM) system’s manual on how to upload
the public key. The private key is used to access your private repository.

Before using the SSH key to access the private repository, create the secret
first:

```
$ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
    --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/ssh/private/key> \
    --from-file=<path/to/known_hosts> \ (1)
    --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
```

| **1** | Optional: Adding this field enables strict server host key check.  |  | Skipping the `known_hosts` file while creating the secret makes the build vulnerable to a potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack. | | --- | --- |   |  | Ensure that the `known_hosts` file includes an entry for the host of your source code. | | --- | --- | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

#### Trusted Certificate Authorities

The set of TLS certificate authorities that are trusted during a `git clone`
operation are built into the OpenShift Container Platform infrastructure images. If your Git
server uses a self-signed certificate or one signed by an authority not trusted
by the image, you can create a secret that contains the certificate or disable
TLS verification.

If you create a secret for the `CA certificate`, OpenShift Container Platform uses it to access
your Git server during the `git clone` operation. Using this method is
significantly more secure than disabling Git’s SSL verification, which accepts
any TLS certificate that is presented.

Complete one of the following processes:

* Create a secret with a CA certificate file (recommended).

  1. If your CA uses Intermediate Certificate Authorities, combine the
     certificates for all CAs in a ***ca.crt*** file. Run the following command:

     ```
     $ cat intermediateCA.crt intermediateCA.crt rootCA.crt > ca.crt
     ```
  2. Create the secret:

     ```
     $ oc create secret generic mycert --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file> (1)
     ```

     | **1** | You must use the key name ***ca.crt***. |
     | --- | --- |
* Disable Git TLS verification.

  Set the `GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY`
  environment variable to `true` in the appropriate strategy section of your build
  configuration. You can use the
  [`oc set env`](../../dev_guide/environment_variables.html#dev-guide-environment-variables) command to
  manage `BuildConfig` environment variables.

#### Combinations

Below are several examples of how you can combine the above methods for
creating source clone secrets for your specific needs.

1. To create an SSH-based authentication secret with a ***.gitconfig*** file:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-file=ssh-privatekey=<path/to/ssh/private/key> \
       --from-file=<path/to/.gitconfig> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/ssh-auth
   ```
2. To create a secret that combines a ***.gitconfig*** file and CA certificate:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-file=ca.crt=<path/to/certificate> \
       --from-file=<path/to/.gitconfig>
   ```
3. To create a basic authentication secret with a CA certificate file:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=username=<user_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<password> \
       --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
   ```
4. To create a basic authentication secret with a ***.gitconfig*** file:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=username=<user_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<password> \
       --from-file=</path/to/.gitconfig> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
   ```
5. To create a basic authentication secret with a ***.gitconfig*** file and CA certificate file:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic <secret_name> \
       --from-literal=username=<user_name> \
       --from-literal=password=<password> \
       --from-file=</path/to/.gitconfig> \
       --from-file=ca.crt=</path/to/file> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/basic-auth
   ```

## Binary (Local) Source

Streaming content from a local file system to the builder is
called a `Binary` type build. The corresponding value of
`BuildConfig.spec.source.type` is `Binary` for such builds.

This source type is unique in that it is leveraged solely based on your use of
the `oc start-build`.

|  | Binary type builds require content to be streamed from the local file system, so automatically triggering a binary type build (e.g. via an image change trigger) is not possible, because the binary files cannot be provided. Similarly, you cannot launch binary type builds from the web console. |
| --- | --- |

To utilize binary builds, invoke `oc start-build` with one of these options:

* `--from-file`: The contents of the file you specify are sent as a binary stream
  to the builder. You can also specify a URL to a file. Then, the builder stores
  the data in a file with the same name at the top of the build context.
* `--from-dir` and `--from-repo`: The contents are archived and sent as a binary
  stream to the builder. Then, the builder extracts the contents of the archive
  within the build context directory. With `--from-dir`, you can also specify
  a URL to an archive, which will be extracted.
* `--from-archive`: The archive you specify is sent to the builder, where it is
  extracted within the build context directory. This option
  behaves the same as `--from-dir`; an archive is created on your host first,
  whenever the argument to these options is a directory.

In each of the above cases:

* If your `BuildConfig` already has a `Binary` source type defined, it will
  effectively be ignored and replaced by what the client sends.
* If your `BuildConfig` has a `Git` source type defined, it is dynamically
  disabled, since `Binary` and `Git` are mutually exclusive, and the data in
  the binary stream provided to the builder takes precedence.

Instead of a file name, you can pass a URL with HTTP or HTTPS schema to
`--from-file` and `--from-archive`. When using `--from-file` with a URL, the
name of the file in the builder image is determined by the `Content-Disposition`
header sent by the web server, or the last component of the URL path if the
header is not present. No form of authentication is supported and it is not
possible to use custom TLS certificate or disable certificate validation.

When using `oc new-build --binary=true`, the command ensures that the
restrictions associated with binary builds are enforced. The resulting
`BuildConfig` will have a source type of `Binary`, meaning that the only
valid way to run a build for this `BuildConfig` is to use `oc
start-build` with one of the `--from` options to provide the requisite binary
data.

The `dockerfile` and `contextDir` [source options](#source-code) have
special meaning with binary builds.

`dockerfile` can be used with any binary build source. If `dockerfile` is
used and the binary stream is an archive, its contents serve as a replacement
Dockerfile to any Dockerfile in the archive. If `dockerfile` is used with the
`--from-file` argument, and the file argument is named `dockerfile`, the value
from `dockerfile` replaces the value from the binary stream.

In the case of the binary stream encapsulating extracted archive content, the
value of the `contextDir` field is interpreted as a subdirectory within the
archive, and, if valid, the builder changes into that subdirectory before
executing the build.

## Input Secrets and ConfigMaps

In some scenarios, build operations require credentials or other configuration
data to access dependent resources, but it is undesirable for that information
to be placed in source control. You can define *input secrets* and *input
ConfigMaps* for this purpose.

For example, when building a Java application via Maven, you can set up a
private mirror of Maven Central or JCenter that is accessed via private keys.
In order to download libraries from that private mirror, you have to supply the
following:

1. A ***settings.xml*** file configured with the mirror’s URL and connection
   settings.
2. A private key referenced in the settings file, such as ***~/.ssh/id\_rsa***.

For security reasons, you do not want to expose your credentials in the
application image.

This example describes a Java application, but you can use the same approach
for adding SSL certificates into the ***/etc/ssl/certs*** directory, API keys or
tokens, license files, and more.

### Adding Input Secrets and ConfigMaps

To add an input secret and/or ConfigMap to an existing `BuildConfig`:

1. Create the ConfigMap, if it does not exist:

   ```
   $ oc create configmap settings-mvn \
       --from-file=settings.xml=<path/to/settings.xml>
   ```

   This creates a new ConfigMap named ***settings-mvn***, which contains the
   plain text content of the ***settings.xml*** file.
2. Create the secret, if it does not exist:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic secret-mvn \
       --from-file=id_rsa=<path/to/.ssh/id_rsa>
   ```

   This creates a new secret named ***secret-mvn***, which contains the base64
   encoded content of the ***id\_rsa*** private key.
3. Add the ConfigMap and secret to the `source` section in the existing
   `BuildConfig`:

   ```
   source:
     git:
       uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
     contextDir: helloworld
     configMaps:
       - configMap:
           name: settings-mvn
     secrets:
       - secret:
           name: secret-mvn
   ```

To include the secret and ConfigMap in a new `BuildConfig`, run the following
command:

```
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn"
```

During the build, the ***settings.xml*** and ***id\_rsa*** files are copied into the
directory where the source code is located. In OpenShift Container Platform S2I builder
images, this is the image working directory, which is set using the `WORKDIR`
instruction in the ***Dockerfile***. If you want to specify another directory,
add a `destinationDir` to the definition:

```
source:
  git:
    uri: https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git
  contextDir: helloworld
  configMaps:
    - configMap:
        name: settings-mvn
      destinationDir: ".m2"
  secrets:
    - secret:
        name: secret-mvn
      destinationDir: ".ssh"
```

You can also specify the destination directory when creating a new
`BuildConfig`:

```
$ oc new-build \
    openshift/wildfly-101-centos7~https://github.com/wildfly/quickstart.git \
    --context-dir helloworld --build-secret “secret-mvn:.ssh” \
    --build-config-map "settings-mvn:.m2"
```

In both cases, the ***settings.xml*** file is added to the ***./.m2*** directory of the
build environment, and the ***id\_rsa*** key is added to the ***./.ssh*** directory.
Note that for a
[Docker strategy](../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build) the destination directory must be a relative path.

### Source-to-Image Strategy

When using a `Source` strategy, all defined input secrets are copied to their
respective `destinationDir`. If you left `destinationDir` empty, then the
secrets are placed in the working directory of the builder image.

The same rule is used when a `destinationDir` is a relative path; the secrets
are placed in the paths that are relative to the image’s working directory.
The final directory in the `destinationDir` path is created if it does not exist in the builder image.
All preceding directories in the `destinationDir` must exist, or an error will occur.

|  | Input secrets are added as world-writable (have `0666` permissions) and will be truncated to size zero after executing the ***assemble*** script. This means that the secret files will exist in the resulting image, but they will be empty for security reasons.   Input ConfigMaps are not truncated after the ***assemble*** script completes. |
| --- | --- |

### Docker Strategy

When using a `Docker` strategy, you can add all defined input secrets into your
container image using the
[`ADD`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#add) and
[`COPY` instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) in
your ***Dockerfile***.

If you do not specify the `destinationDir` for a secret, then the files will be
copied into the same directory in which the ***Dockerfile*** is located. If you
specify a relative path as `destinationDir`, then the secrets will be copied
into that directory, relative to your ***Dockerfile*** location. This makes the
secret files available to the Docker build operation as part of the context
directory used during the build.

Example 1. Example of a Dockerfile referencing secret and ConfigMap data
```
FROM centos/ruby-22-centos7

USER root
COPY ./secret-dir /secrets
COPY ./config /

# Create a shell script that will output secrets and ConfigMaps when the image is run
RUN echo '#!/bin/sh' > /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /secrets/secret1 && echo -n "secret1=" && cat /secrets/secret1)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN echo '(test -f /config && echo -n "relative-configMap=" && cat /config)' >> /input_report.sh
RUN chmod 755 /input_report.sh

CMD ["/bin/sh", "-c", "/input_report.sh"]
```

|  | Users should normally remove their input secrets from the final application image so that the secrets are not present in the container running from that image. However, the secrets will still exist in the image itself in the layer where they were added. This removal should be part of the ***Dockerfile*** itself. |
| --- | --- |

### Custom Strategy

When using a `Custom` strategy, all the defined input secrets and ConfigMaps
are available inside the builder container in the ***/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build***
directory. The custom build image is responsible for using these secrets
and ConfigMaps appropriately. The `Custom` strategy also allows secrets to be
defined as described in [Custom Strategy Options](build_strategies.html#custom-secrets).

There is no technical difference between existing strategy secrets and the input
secrets. However, your builder image might distinguish between them and use them
differently, based on your build use case.

The input secrets are always mounted into the
***/var/run/secrets/openshift.io/build*** directory or your builder can parse the
`$BUILD` environment variable, which includes the full build object.

## Using External Artifacts

It is not recommended to store binary files in a source repository. Therefore,
you may find it necessary to define a build which pulls additional files (such
as Java ***.jar*** dependencies) during the build process. How this is done
depends on the build strategy you are using.

For a `Source` build strategy, you must put appropriate shell commands into
the ***assemble*** script:

***.s2i/bin/assemble*** File
```
#!/bin/sh
APP_VERSION=1.0
wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar
```

***.s2i/bin/run*** File
```
#!/bin/sh
exec java -jar app.jar
```

|  | For more information on how to control which ***assemble*** and ***run*** script is used by a Source build, see [Overriding Builder Image Scripts](build_strategies.html#override-builder-image-scripts). |
| --- | --- |

For a `Docker` build strategy, you must modify the ***Dockerfile*** and invoke
shell commands with the
[`RUN` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run):

Excerpt of ***Dockerfile***
```
FROM jboss/base-jdk:8

ENV APP_VERSION 1.0
RUN wget http://repository.example.com/app/app-$APP_VERSION.jar -O app.jar

EXPOSE 8080
CMD [ "java", "-jar", "app.jar" ]
```

In practice, you may want to use an environment variable for the file location
so that the specific file to be downloaded can be customized using an
environment variable defined on the `BuildConfig`, rather than updating the
***Dockerfile*** or
***assemble*** script.

You can choose between different methods of defining environment variables:

* [Using the ***.s2i/environment*** file](build_strategies.html#environment-files) (only for a
  Source build strategy)
* [Setting in `BuildConfig`](build_strategies.html#buildconfig-environment)
* [Providing
  explicitly using `oc start-build --env`](../../cli_reference/basic_cli_operations.html#build-and-deployment-cli-operations) (only for builds that are triggered
  manually)

## Using Docker Credentials for Private Registries

You can supply builds with a ***.docker/config.json*** file with valid credentials
for private container registries. This allows you to push the output image into a
private container image registry or pull a builder image from the private container image registry
that requires authentication.

|  | For the OpenShift Container Platform container image registry, this is not required because secrets are generated automatically for you by OpenShift Container Platform. |
| --- | --- |

The ***.docker/config.json*** file is found in your home directory by default and
has the following format:

```
auths:
  https://index.docker.io/v1/: (1)
    auth: "YWRfbGzhcGU6R2labnRib21ifTE=" (2)
    email: "user@example.com" (3)
```

| **1** | URL of the registry. |
| --- | --- |
| **2** | Encrypted password. |
| **3** | Email address for the login. |

You can define multiple container image registry entries in this file. Alternatively, you
can also add authentication entries to this file by running the `docker login`
command. The file will be created if it does not exist.

Kubernetes provides
[`Secret`](../../dev_guide/secrets.html#dev-guide-secrets) objects, which can
be used to store configuration and passwords.

1. Create the secret from your local ***.docker/config.json*** file:

   ```
   $ oc create secret generic dockerhub \
       --from-file=.dockerconfigjson=<path/to/.docker/config.json> \
       --type=kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson
   ```

   This generates a JSON specification of the secret named `dockerhub` and
   creates the object.
2. Once the secret is created, add it to the builder service account. Each build is
   run with the `builder` role, so you must give it access your secret with the
   following command:

   ```
   $ oc secrets link builder dockerhub
   ```
3. Add a `pushSecret` field into the `output` section of the `BuildConfig` and
   set it to the name of the `secret` that you created, which in the above example
   is `dockerhub`:

   ```
   spec:
     output:
       to:
         kind: "DockerImage"
         name: "private.registry.com/org/private-image:latest"
       pushSecret:
         name: "dockerhub"
   ```

   You can also use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the push secret on
   the build configuration:

   ```
   $ oc set build-secret --push bc/sample-build dockerhub
   ```
4. Pull the builder container image from a private container image registry by specifying the
   `pullSecret` field, which is part of the build strategy definition:

   ```
   strategy:
     sourceStrategy:
       from:
         kind: "DockerImage"
         name: "docker.io/user/private_repository"
       pullSecret:
         name: "dockerhub"
   ```

   You can also use the `oc set build-secret` command to set the pull secret on
   the build configuration:

   ```
   $ oc set build-secret --pull bc/sample-build dockerhub
   ```

|  | This example uses `pullSecret` in a Source build, but it is also applicable in Docker and Custom builds. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-05-23 16:13:36 UTC  ``` OpenShift builds don't seem to cache the SSH key of the git repository. This allows an attacker who can MiTM, take over DNS etc to supply their own content.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c1)  Dave Baker    2019-05-23 16:21:04 UTC  ``` Created repro; confirmed against 3.9, 3.11 and 4.1 rc5.   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c2)  Dave Baker    2019-05-23 16:31:22 UTC  ``` Tracked to scmauth/sshkey.go within builder.  Link here is for 3.11  <https://github.com/openshift/origin/blob/release-3.11/pkg/build/builder/cmd/scmauth/sshkey.go#L26-L28>  	content := "#!/bin/sh\nssh -i " + 		filepath.Join(baseDir, SSHPrivateKeyMethodName) + 		" -o StrictHostKeyChecking=false \"$@\"\n"   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c3)  Dave Baker    2019-05-23 16:47:55 UTC  ``` Flagging 3.6 and later as all affected from observation of source code.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c8)  Marian Rehak    2019-05-29 12:29:35 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: @l14n_uk   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c9)  Dave Baker    2019-05-29 20:25:03 UTC  ``` Statement:  OpenShift Container Platform allows for various types of "source clone secrets" to be defined in order to permit building from non-public git repositories.  When using ssh key authentication, the server host key checking function is disabled.  An attacker with the ability to redirect the network traffic and perform a "man in the middle" attack will be able to redirect the build job to use arbitrary content of their choosing.  Note that the same flaw (non-verification of remote server) is present when using HTTP, or when using HTTPS with TLS verification manually disabled.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c10)  Dave Baker    2019-05-29 20:25:05 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/dev_guide/builds/build_inputs.html#source-secrets-ssh-key-authentication>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c11)  Dave Baker    2019-05-29 20:25:06 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Use only methods (such as HTTPS with TLS verification) that enable the identity of the remote repository to be validated.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c12)  Dave Baker    2019-05-30 00:07:19 UTC  ``` Updating CVSS to align to other MITM style flaws. - MITM can be performed through many means (DNS redirection, traffic redirection, etc), leading to a complex attack. - Attacking user needs no local privs on the cluster, and with MITM abilities can observe traffic requests in order to construct their attack. - Scope is unchanged - whatever permissions in the cluster the builder pod has, they remain the same with the altered build content.   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c14)  Dave Baker    2019-05-30 00:12:52 UTC  ``` Created origin tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1715256](show_bug.cgi?id=1715256 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-10150 origin: atomic-openshift: OpenShift builds don't verify SSH Host Keys for the git repository [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c24)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-10-14 08:48:55 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.10  Via RHSA-2019:2989 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2989](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2989)   ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=1713433#c25)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-10-14 12:51:19 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
