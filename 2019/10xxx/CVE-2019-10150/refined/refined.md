{
  "CVE-2019-10150": {
    "Description": "Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not perform SSH Host Key checking when using ssh key authentication during builds. An attacker, with the ability to redirect network traffic, could use this to alter the resulting build output.",
    "Root cause": "The OpenShift build process does not verify the SSH host key when cloning a git repository, disabling StrictHostKeyChecking.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Missing SSH host key verification"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker with the ability to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack can redirect the build job to use arbitrary content from a malicious Git repository.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "MITM attack on the network connection between the OpenShift build process and the Git repository."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "Ability to redirect network traffic between the OpenShift build process and the Git repository."
    ],
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is present when using SSH key authentication, and the same flaw is present when using HTTP or HTTPS with TLS verification manually disabled. Mitigation includes only using methods that enable the remote repository to be validated such as HTTPS with TLS verification."
