  "CVE-2019-10740": {
    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2019-10740",
      "Description": "In Roundcube Webmail before 1.3.10, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s) back to the attacker."
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from how Roundcube (and many other email clients) handle partially encrypted multipart messages. It doesn't verify if the PGP encrypted part is the root node in the MIME tree before decrypting it.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of multipart MIME messages with encrypted parts.",
        "Decryption of encrypted parts even if they are not the root node in the MIME structure."
      ],
       "Impact": "An attacker can potentially leak the plaintext of encrypted messages. By crafting a multipart message with an encrypted part embedded within it, an attacker can trick the victim into decrypting the message and then leaking the plaintext back to the attacker through a reply.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted multipart email containing an encrypted part embedded within the message body.",
      "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be in possession of the encrypted messages intended for the victim. This can be achieved through passive man-in-the-middle attacks or by compromising the victim's mail server or gateway. The attacker also needs to be able to send emails to the victim."
    },
     "Additional Information": {
        "Details": "The attacker embeds the encrypted message within a multipart email and prepends or appends attacker-controlled text. When the victim replies, the decrypted message is included in the reply, thus exposing it to the attacker. The attacker can further obfuscate the encrypted part by adding newlines or hiding it within a long conversation history.",
        "Mitigation": "The recommended countermeasure is to not decrypt emails unless the PGP encrypted part is the root node (and the only part) in the MIME tree."
    }
