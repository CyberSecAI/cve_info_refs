## Description

![@jensvoid](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4751530?u=6748d6058573f37628da406021f094442bb2ef85&v=4&size=48)[jensvoid](https://github.com/jensvoid)opened [on Feb 22, 2019](https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/6638#issue-413348015)

In the scope of academic research in cooperation with Ruhr-Uni Bochum and FH Münster, Germany we discovered a security issue in Roundcube/Enigma: An attacker who is in possession of PGP encrypted messages can embed them into a multipart message and re-send them to the intended receiver. When the message is read and decrypted by the receiver, the attacker's content is shown. If the victim replies, the plaintext is leaked to an attacker's email address. The root cause for these vulnerabilities lies in the way Roundcube (and many other mail clients) handle partially encrypted multipart messages.

**Leaking plaintext through replies**

*Attacker model*: Attacker is in possession of PGP encrypted messages, which she may have obtained as passive man-in-the-middle or by actively hacking into the victim's mail server or gateway

*Attacker's goal*: Leak the plaintext by wrapping the ciphertext part within a benign-looking MIME mail sent to and decrypted+replied to by the victim

*Attack outline:* If Roundcube receives a multipart email, as depicted below, it decrypt the ciphertext part(s), together with the attacker-controlled text (which may be prepended and/or appended).

```
multipart/mixed
   |--- Attacker's part
   |--- [encrypted part]
   +--- Attacker's part

```

A benign-looking attacker's text may lure the victim into replying. Because the decrypted part is also quoted in the reply, the user unintentionally acts as a decryption oracle. To obfuscate the existence of the encrypted part(s), the attacker may add a lot of newlines or hide it within a long conversation history. A user replying to such a ‘mixed content’ conversation thereby leaks the plaintext of encrypted messages wrapped within attacker-controlled text.

**Countermeasures**

Do not decrypt emails unless the PGP encrypted part is the root node -- and therefore the only part -- in the MIME tree.

Thanks for the great work on enigma and roundcube-1.4 with elastic!

I had this issue on version 1.3.6 and on 1.4-beta now too.

I once had enigma running pretty well but I do not know when exactly, it broke somewhere.

I have debian stable with php-7.0. I read somewhere about issues with no available php-crypt-gpg and php-mail-mime but both are installed on my debian, the php-crypt-pgp from current unstable (including all stable dependencies. Worked fine). Regardless, the error was the same without php-crypt-pgp.

The debug log is from use case: Send signed and encrypted mail to myself. My pub and priv keys are available as pair. Sending fails with: "Encryption failed. Public key not found for ."

This is logs/enigma.log (enigma debug is on):

## Description

In Roundcube Webmail before 1.3.10, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s) back to the attacker.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVE-2019-10740

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-10735.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-10744.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-10740 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10740)

#### Description

In Roundcube Webmail before 1.3.10, an attacker in possession of S/MIME or PGP encrypted emails can wrap them as sub-parts within a crafted multipart email. The encrypted part(s) can further be hidden using HTML/CSS or ASCII newline characters. This modified multipart email can be re-sent by the attacker to the intended receiver. If the receiver replies to this (benign looking) email, they unknowingly leak the plaintext of the encrypted message part(s) back to the attacker.
