{
  "CVE-2019-10220": {
    "root_cause": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel SMB client (cifs.ko). Path separators are not checked when parsing directory listings. A malicious server can return relative paths, which can lead to manipulation of files outside shared mount points.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of directory entries returned by SMB servers."
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious SMB server can cause manipulation of files outside the shared mount point, leading to potential data confidentiality and integrity issues, as well as system availability problems. This can also lead to security checks being bypassed in applications that read the directory.",
    "attack_vectors": "A compromised or malicious SMB server that sends directory listings containing relative paths.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to control or compromise an SMB server and have a client that connects to it.",
      "additional_details": "The fix was implemented at the VFS (Virtual File System) level instead of per file system level, which means all networked filesystems are protected from this vulnerability."
