                 CVE-2019-19966

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leak.

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14895, CVE-2019-14901

    ADLab of Venustech discovered potential heap buffer overflows in
    the mwifiex wifi driver.  On systems using this driver, a
    malicious Wireless Access Point or adhoc/P2P peer could use these
    to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or
    possibly for remote code execution.

CVE-2019-14896, CVE-2019-14897

Debian Bug     : 869511 945023

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2018-13093, CVE-2018-13094

    Wen Xu from SSLab at Gatech reported several NULL pointer
    dereference flaws that may be triggered when mounting and
    operating a crafted XFS volume.  An attacker able to mount
    arbitrary XFS volumes could use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).

CVE-2018-20976

    It was discovered that the XFS file-system implementation did not
    correctly handle some mount failure conditions, which could lead
    to a use-after-free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2018-21008

    It was discovered that the rsi wifi driver did not correctly
    handle some failure conditions, which could lead to a use-after-
    free.  The security impact of this is unclear.

CVE-2019-0136

    It was discovered that the wifi soft-MAC implementation (mac80211)
    did not properly authenticate Tunneled Direct Link Setup (TDLS)
    messages.  A nearby attacker could use this for denial of service
    (loss of wifi connectivity).

CVE-2019-2215

    The syzkaller tool discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in
    the Android binder driver.  A local user on a system with this
    driver enabled could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.
    However, this driver is not enabled on Debian packaged kernels.

CVE-2019-10220

    Various developers and researchers found that if a crafted file-
    system or malicious file server presented a directory with
    filenames including a '/' character, this could confuse and
    possibly defeat security checks in applications that read the
    directory.

    The kernel will now return an error when reading such a directory,
    rather than passing the invalid filenames on to user-space.

CVE-2019-14615

    It was discovered that Intel 9th and 10th generation GPUs did not
    clear user-visible state during a context switch, which resulted
    in information leaks between GPU tasks.  This has been mitigated
    in the i915 driver.

    The affected chips (gen9 and gen10) are listed at
    <<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_graphics_processing_units#Gen9>>.

CVE-2019-14814, CVE-2019-14815, CVE-2019-14816

    Multiple bugs were discovered in the mwifiex wifi driver, which
    could lead to heap buffer overflows.  A local user permitted to
    configure a device handled by this driver could probably use this
    for privilege escalation.

    could use this to cause a denial of service (BUG/oops) or to read
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-15917

    The syzkaller tool found a race condition in code supporting
    UART-attached Bluetooth adapters, which could lead to a use-
    after-free.  A local user with access to a pty device or other
    suitable tty device could use this to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-16746

    It was discovered that the wifi stack did not validate the content
    of beacon heads provided by user-space for use on a wifi interface
    in Access Point mode, which could lead to a heap buffer overflow.

CVE-2019-17056

    Ori Nimron reported that various network protocol implementations
    - AX.25, IEEE 802.15.4, Appletalk, ISDN, and NFC - allowed all
    users to create raw sockets.  A local user could use this to send
    arbitrary packets on networks using those protocols.

CVE-2019-17075

    It was found that the cxgb4 Infiniband driver requested DMA
    (Direct Memory Access) to a stack-allocated buffer, which is not
    supported and on some systems can result in memory corruption of
    the stack.  A local user might be able to use this for denial of
    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2019-17133

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the wifi stack did not valdiate
    received SSID information before copying it, which could lead to a
    buffer overflow if it is not validated by the driver or firmware.
    A malicious Wireless Access Point might be able to use this to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or for
    remote code execution.

CVE-2019-17666

    Nicholas Waisman reported that the rtlwifi wifi drivers did not
    properly validate received P2P information, leading to a buffer
    overflow.  A malicious P2P peer could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or for remote code
    execution.

CVE-2019-18282

    Jonathan Berger, Amit Klein, and Benny Pinkas discovered that the
    generation of UDP/IPv6 flow labels used a weak hash function,
    "jhash".  This could enable tracking individual computers as they
    communicate with different remote servers and from different
    networks.  The "siphash" function is now used instead.

CVE-2019-18683

    Multiple race conditions were discovered in the vivid media
    driver, used for testing Video4Linux2 (V4L2) applications,
    These race conditions could result in a use-after-free.  On a
    system where this driver is loaded, a user with permission
    to access media devices could use this to cause a denial
    of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-18809

    information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-19534, CVE-2019-19535, CVE-2019-19536

    The syzkaller tool discovered that the peak_usb CAN driver was
    missing initialisation of some structures, which could leak
    sensitive information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-19537

    The syzkaller tool discovered race conditions in the USB stack,
    involving character device registration.  An attacker able to add
    USB devices could use this to cause a denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19767

    The syzkaller tool discovered that crafted ext4 volumes could
    trigger a buffer overflow in the ext4 filesystem driver.  An
    attacker able to mount such a volume could use this to cause a
    denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for
    privilege escalation.

CVE-2019-19947

    It was discovered that the kvaser_usb CAN driver was missing
    initialisation of some structures, which could leak sensitive
    information from kernel memory.

CVE-2019-19965

    Gao Chuan reported a race condition in the libsas library used by
    SCSI host drivers, which could lead to a null pointer dereference.
    An attacker able to add and remove SCSI devices could use this to
    cause a denial of service (BUG/oops).

CVE-2019-20096

    The Hulk Robot tool discovered a potential memory leak in the DCCP
    protocol implementation.  This may be exploitable by local users,
    or by remote attackers if the system uses DCCP, to cause a denial
    of service (out of memory).

For Debian 8 "Jessie", these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.210-1~deb8u1.  This update additionally fixes Debian bugs
#869511 and 945023; and includes many more bug fixes from stable
updates 4.9.190-4.9.210 inclusive.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.9 packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-08-16 00:41:52 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in the Linux kernel SMB client. Path separators are not checked by cifs.ko when parsing directory listings back, so a bad server can return relative paths that will be returned as-is to userspace potencially leading to manipulating of files outside shared mount points.  Upstream patch:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/fs?id=4f11918ab93bc113ec0831ed2ab7b88847d44dd7>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c1)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-08-16 00:41:57 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the SUSE Labs samba team Upstream: Michael Hanselmann   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c2)  Marian Rehak    2019-11-27 15:16:44 UTC  ``` Created kernel tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1777399](show_bug.cgi?id=1777399 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-10220 kernel: CIFS: Relative paths injection in directory entry lists [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c3)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2019-11-27 20:05:42 UTC  ``` Hi  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741728](show_bug.cgi?id=1741728) is not publicly accessible, which I assume contains more information. Can you make those available? Is the issue fixed upstream?  Regards, Salvatore   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c4)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2019-11-27 20:10:11 UTC  ``` Seems related to the SuSE bugzilla entry at <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1144903>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c5)  Justin M. Forbes    2019-12-02 14:18:07 UTC  ``` This was fixed for Fedora with the 5.3.8 stable kernel updates.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c6)  Petr Matousek    2019-12-06 13:00:00 UTC  ``` Hi Salvatore,  In reply to [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c3): > [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1741728](show_bug.cgi?id=1741728) is not publicly > accessible, which I assume contains more information.

Please see [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c0).  Thank you, -- Petr Matousek / Red Hat Product Security   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c7)  Wade Mealing    2019-12-09 04:05:47 UTC  ``` Gday,  I think that this was fixed here:  <https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/fs?id=4f11918ab93bc113ec0831ed2ab7b88847d44dd7>  Which kinda negates the need for this fix as its fixing it for all networked filesystems on the vfs level.  Does this answre your question ?   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c8)  Salvatore Bonaccorso    2019-12-13 14:16:32 UTC  ``` Many thanks for confirming!   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1741727#c9)  Wade Mealing    2019-12-16 03:32:36 UTC  ``` No problem , thanks for the follow up.   ``` |  |
