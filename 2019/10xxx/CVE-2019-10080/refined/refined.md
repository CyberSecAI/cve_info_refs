Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10080:

**CVE Description:**

The provided content states:
* **Title:** Potential Information Disclosure through XML External Entity Resolution in File Lookup Service
* **Affected Versions:** 1.3.0 to 1.9.2
* **Fixed Versions:** 1.10.0

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `XMLFileLookupService` in Apache NiFi was vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. The service allowed users to configure an XML file, which, if malicious, could make external calls to services using XXE resolution, potentially revealing sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The service did not properly sanitize or restrict XML input, allowing external entity references.
- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, such as versions of Java, Jersey, and Apache being used by the NiFi instance.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially gain insights into the NiFi instance's environment, including software versions and potentially internal configurations. This information could then be used to further exploit the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- An authenticated user, who is authorized to configure a controller service, could upload a malicious XML configuration file to the `XMLFileLookupService` with external entity references.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a trusted/authenticated user with authorization to configure the `XMLFileLookupService`.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in NiFi 1.10.0 by adding an XML validator to ensure the XML file is not malicious. Specifically:
    - A `SafeXMLConfiguration` was implemented to disable XML DTDs.
    - An `XXEValidator` was added to check for `!ENTITY` declarations in the file.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was reported by RunningSnail.
- The fix involved creating a new SafeXMLConfiguration that disables XML DTDs that may call external entities.
- The fix was implemented by adding a check for `!ENTITY` declarations in the XML file using a regular expression.
- Multiple attempts were made to resolve the issue, including initial fixes that were bypassed by multiline XXE attacks.
- The validator was found to run continuously, even after a controller service was deleted, which was fixed under another JIRA ticket `NIFI-6371`.
- The vulnerability could potentially expose the version of Java, Jersey and Apache used by the NiFi instance.
