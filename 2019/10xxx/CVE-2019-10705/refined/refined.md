      "Improperly protected intermediate key leading to decryption of data without proper authentication.",
        "If the Opal SSC is activated and configured with more than one LBA range enabled, and at least one range does not have read or write locking enabled, the contents of any ranges with both read and write locking enabled may be decrypted through an improperly protected intermediate key.",
