This is not guaranteed to exist in all clusters.

Node roles are not an api and no business logic should based on node roles.

IIUC, there are 2 ways to distinguish master nodes from worker nodes:

* role label
* Master taints

So, are you suggesting, we cannot rely on role label which the `defaultNodeSelector` is based on? IIRC, we used to have something like `type=Compute` as defaultNodeSelector in 3.11.

This is not to say that we cannot have a validation against pods have master tolerations

[@smarterclayton](https://github.com/smarterclayton) Can you explain what you mean by "Node roles are not an api and no business logic should based on node roles."? It has been common practice with OpenShift in the field to add role labels to nodes and separate workload based on these labels by using node selectors and the `openshift.io/node-selector` annotation. This has been a very effective design pattern, what is inappropriate about this? Should we encourage use of a different label?

| I'm a -1 on resolving the issue this way. The mechanism for steering workloads away from masters is taints and restricting tolerations. I thought this is what PodTolerationRestrictions did, but that plugin is very confused. Mapping tolerations to rbac permissions for serviceaccounts seems more practical.  Doing it like this will restrict our future choices of node topologies |

| Can we get an update on where we are at on this issue?  We need this resolved both for the potential security impact and also to clarify how users should isolate workload when there is a security concern.  In my experience as an openshift consultant and instructor, taints and tolerations are not well suited for security isolation because most users find these difficult to understand and implement. While it may be possible to resolve this with podTolerationRestrictions, this is likely going to be hopelessly complicated for many OpenShift administrators. Node selectors are much easier for our users and administrators to understand and node selectors on namespaces are easy to audit with automation.  imho, we should label all masters as `node-role.kubernetes.io/master` everything else as workers, `node-role.kubernetes.io/worker`, and set the default for the defaultNodeSeloctor to run on workers as this PR was aiming to do. In the case where we want workload to run on the masters, we simply add the worker label to the masters, so it really shouldn't limit node topologies. |

## Description

A flaw was discovered in OpenShift Container Platform 4 where, by default, users with access to create pods also have the ability to schedule workloads on master nodes. Pods with permission to access the host network, running on master nodes, can retrieve security credentials for the master AWS IAM role, allowing management access to AWS resources. With access to the security credentials, the user then has access to the entire infrastructure. Impact to data and system availability is high.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-07-16 02:59:38 UTC  ``` In the default configuration, OpenShift Container Platform 4 allows users with access to create pods the ability to schedule workloads on master nodes. Pods with permission to access the host network, running on master nodes, can retrieve security credentials for the master AWS IAM role, allowing management access to AWS resources. Pod access to the host network can be granted with the hostnetwork SCC.   Original Bug:  [https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1729242](show_bug.cgi?id=1729242)   Upstream Fix:  <https://github.com/openshift/cluster-kube-apiserver-operator/pull/524>   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c4)  Sam Fowler    2019-12-12 03:47:45 UTC  ``` OpenShift Documentation has been updated to include the following:  "If additional workloads are run on master hosts, use caution when providing access to hostnetwork. A workload that runs hostnetwork on a master host is effectively root on the cluster and must be trusted accordingly."  <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c5)  Sam Fowler    2019-12-12 04:54:46 UTC  ``` Transitioning to Version 2 of the Instance Metadata Service would address this issue:  <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance-metadata-service.html>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c6)  Sam Fowler    2020-05-06 05:59:33 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c5): > Transitioning to Version 2 of the Instance Metadata Service would address > this issue: >  > <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/configuring-instance>- > metadata-service.html  While IMDSv2 seems a valuable defense-in-depth measure (to protect against SSRF etc), it seems a pod with access to the host network on a master node will still be able to retrieve IAM role credentials (via an additional PUT request beforehand).   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c9)  Sam Fowler    2020-05-20 02:13:15 UTC  ``` Downgrading impact to Moderate as only admin users should be able to schedule pods onto master nodes.   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1730161#c13)  Sam Fowler    2020-08-20 02:18:01 UTC  ``` Mitigation:  Do not run untrusted workloads with `hostnetwork` access on master nodes.  If additional workloads are run on master hosts, use caution when providing access to hostnetwork. A workload that runs hostnetwork on a master host is effectively root on the cluster and must be trusted accordingly.   <https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.4/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html>   ``` |  |
