The provided content describes multiple stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities within Delta Industrial Automation's CNCSoft ScreenEditor related to parsing DPB files. All of them are assigned to CVE-2019-10947.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input validation when parsing specific elements within DPB files. The software does not check the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a fixed-size stack buffer. This allows for a buffer overflow when the provided data exceeds the allocated buffer size.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Multiple stack-based buffer overflows exists due to the lack of user-supplied data validation. Specifically, these vulnerabilities occur when parsing the following elements of a DPB file:
*   `wTextLen`
*   `wMessageLen`
*   `wKPFStringLen`
*   `PanelName`
*  `wFontTextLen`

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Administrator, potentially leading to complete system compromise. Additionally, the application may crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves tricking the user into opening a specially crafted DPB file or visiting a malicious page which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to craft a malicious DPB file. The attacker must also rely on user interaction to open the malicious file or visit a malicious website. No specific privileges are required by the attacker, but the targeted user will be executing the program as administrator.
