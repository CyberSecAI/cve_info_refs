The provided content is related to CVE-2019-10441.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The iceScrum Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation and did not require POST requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The plugin lacked proper authorization checks on a method used for form validation.
- CSRF vulnerability: The form validation method did not require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server using attacker-specified credentials (access token, username, or password).
- Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information (e.g., access tokens or credentials) or unauthorized actions on the attacker-specified server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: A malicious user could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
- CSRF: An attacker could trick a logged-in user into submitting a malicious request, potentially exploiting the vulnerable form validation method.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Jenkins server.
