Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10795

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `undefsafe` library is vulnerable to prototype pollution. The `undefsafe` function could be manipulated to add or modify properties of `Object.prototype` by using a `__proto__` payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Prototype Pollution: The core weakness is the ability to modify the prototype of the base JavaScript `Object`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security issues across the application using the vulnerable library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Although the text discusses ReDoS, it is not the vulnerability in question. This vulnerability could lead to unexpected behaviour, or possibly a DoS via prototype modification.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted input to the `undefsafe` function, specifically by providing a `__proto__` property as a path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input to the `undefsafe` function, specifically the `path` argument. This implies an attacker would need to influence the code using this library.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Snyk information includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability, showing how setting `__proto__.toString` modifies the prototype.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade `undefsafe` to version 2.0.3 or higher.
- The commit log from Github shows the fix implemented in the `undefsafe.js` file.
