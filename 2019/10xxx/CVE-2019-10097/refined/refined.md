  "description": "When mod_remoteip was configured to use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the \"PROXY\" protocol, a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients.",
