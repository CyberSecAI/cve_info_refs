  "CVE-2019-10999": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a buffer overflow in the `alphapd` server when processing the `wireless.htm` page. Specifically, the `WEPEncryption` parameter in the URL is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to supply a value longer than 0x28 bytes, leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Buffer overflow due to lack of input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can gain control of the device by injecting arbitrary code. The provided exploit demonstrates remote command execution. The impact could range from denial of service to full device compromise.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending a crafted HTTP GET request to the device's web server with a long `WEPEncryption` parameter in the URL, leading to the buffer overflow."
      ],
      "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device and valid credentials to access the web interface (default credentials are 'admin' with a blank password)"
      ],
        "additional_info": "The exploit requires authentication to be successful, but the default credentials are 'admin' with a blank password which makes exploitation more feasible. The vulnerability is present in multiple D-Link camera models, as specified in the provided information. The provided exploit allows for remote command execution. The provided links also contain a video and detailed blog posts which goes in depth on the issue. The exploit is specifically triggered when accessing the `wireless.htm` page with the `WEPEncryption` parameter, thus targeting the device's web server."
