Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `im-resize` package is vulnerable to command injection. The `cmd` argument within `index.js` is constructed using user-supplied data without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the shell command executed by the application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization, which enables command injection through the `image` parameter in `index.js`. Specifically, the `path` property within the `image` object is not properly sanitized before being used to construct a shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the application. This can lead to a variety of malicious activities, including data exfiltration, system compromise, and denial of service.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The impact could range from the disclosure of sensitive information (confidentiality) to modification or destruction of data (integrity), and disruption of service (availability). According to the CVSS vector, the Confidentiality is rated High, Integrity and Availability are None.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable. Attackers can send crafted requests containing malicious input via the network.
- **Input Parameter:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious commands via the `image` parameter, specifically the `path` property.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to send network requests to the server running the vulnerable application.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know that the `image` parameter, specifically the `path` property, is vulnerable to command injection.
- **No Privileges Required:** No prior authentication or special access to the system is required to carry out this attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The Snyk analysis provides a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability by injecting a command that creates a file.
- A fix was pushed to the master branch that checks for suspicious characters in the input using a regular expression.
- Snyk gives the vulnerability a severity score of 7.5 (High) while NVD gives it a score of 9.8 (Critical)
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). However, this categorization seems incorrect, the described vulnerability is command injection which should be categorized under CWE-78.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-10787 is a command injection vulnerability in the `im-resize` package stemming from unsanitized input being used to construct shell commands. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, doesn't require user interaction and can lead to a complete loss of confidentiality.
