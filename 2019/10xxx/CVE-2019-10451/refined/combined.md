## Descriptions

### Arbitrary file read vulnerability in Google OAuth Credentials Plugin

**SECURITY-1583
/
CVE-2019-10436**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-oauth-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-oauth-plugin)**

**Description:**

Google OAuth Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of credentials based on the content of files on the Jenkins controller through a feature retaining backwards compatibility with earlier plugin releases.
This allowed users with the permission to configure jobs and credentials to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller by creating a credential referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins controller.

Google OAuth Credentials Plugin no longer allows a regular user to create credentials in the legacy format.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1006 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10437 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10438 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`crx-content-package-deployer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/crx-content-package-deployer)**

**Description:**

CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin now requires POST requests and Item/Configure permission.

### Users with Overall/Read access could enumerate credential IDs in CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin

**SECURITY-1006 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10439**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`crx-content-package-deployer`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/crx-content-package-deployer)**

**Description:**

CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not correctly check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in CRX Content Package Deployer Plugin now requires the appropriate permission.

### NeoLoad Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1427
/
CVE-2019-10440**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`neoload-jenkins-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/neoload-jenkins-plugin)**

**Description:**

NeoLoad Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jenkinsci.plugins.neoload.integration.NeoGlobalConfig.xml` and in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

NeoLoad Plugin now stores these credentials encrypted.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in iceScrum Plugin

**SECURITY-1484
/
CVE-2019-10441 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10442 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`icescrum`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/icescrum)**

**Description:**

iceScrum Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified access token or username and password.

Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

iceScrum Plugin now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.

### iceScrum Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1436
/
CVE-2019-10443**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`icescrum`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/icescrum)**

**Description:**

iceScrum Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

iceScrum Plugin 1.1.5 and newer now stores these credentials encrypted.

### Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-1481
/
CVE-2019-10444**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`bumblebee`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/bumblebee)**

**Description:**

Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for connections to the HP ALM service.

Bumblebee HP ALM Plugin no longer does that.
Instead, it now allows users to opt out of certificate validation.

### Missing permission checks in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin allowed validating and obtaining data

**SECURITY-1607
/
CVE-2019-10445**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-kubernetes-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-kubernetes-engine)**

**Description:**

Missing permission checks in Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to obtain limited information about the scope and access of a credential with an attacker-specified credential ID obtained through another method.

Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission for these operations.

### Cadence vManager Plugin globally and unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-1615
/
CVE-2019-10446**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`vmanager-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vmanager-plugin)**

**Description:**

Cadence vManager Plugin unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

Cadence vManager Plugin no longer does that.
Instead, it now has an opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors for its connections.

### Script sandbox bypass vulnerability in Puppet Enterprise Pipeline Plugin

**SECURITY-918
/
CVE-2019-10458**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`puppet-enterprise-pipeline`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/puppet-enterprise-pipeline)**

**Description:**

Puppet Enterprise Pipeline
Plugin defines a custom list of pre-approved signatures for all scripts protected by the Script Security sandbox.

This custom list of pre-approved signatures allows the use of methods that can be used to bypass Script Security sandbox protection.
This results in arbitrary code execution on any Jenkins instance with this plugin installed.

# SOASTA CloudTest

How to installThe Jenkins project announced unresolved security vulnerabilities affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):

* **[CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check allow SSRF](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-04-03/#SECURITY-1054)**
* **[Credentials stored in plain text](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-10-16/#SECURITY-1439)**

* [Documentation](/cloudtest/)
* [Releases](/cloudtest/releases/)
* [Issues](/cloudtest/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/cloudtest/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/cloudtest/healthscore/)

This plugin integrates [SOASTA
CloudTest](http://www.soasta.com/products/cloudtest/) and [SOASTA
TouchTest](http://www.soasta.com/products/touchtest/) features into
Jenkins.

The CloudTest Jenkins plugin provides the ability to

* Easily run the MakeAppTouchTestable utility on an iOS or Android
  project
* Silently install an iOS app on a connected device
* Play CloudTest compositions and include the output in the build's
  test results
* Launch and tear down grids, results databases, and test
  environments.

## Prerequisites

The CloudTest plug-in requires Jenkins 1.580.1 or later.

## Global Configuration Options

Before using the plug-in, you will need to provide the CloudTest server
information, in the "Manage Jenkins" -> "Configure System" page. This
includes the CloudTest URL and a set of credentials. *We recommend
creating a dedicated CloudTest account for Jenkins to use.*

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/cloudtest/docs/images/Configure_System_Screen_Shot.png)

The CloudTest password is encrypted before saving it to disk. It is also
masked (e.g. "\*\*\*\*") in all output generated during builds.

## Build Steps

The plug-in adds the following new build steps:

#### Make App TouchTestable

Adds the TouchTest Driver library to your app's source code. Typically
this build step is inserted right before the build step that compiles
the app's code (e.g. before the Xcode build step for iOS, or before the
"Invoke Ant" build step for Android).

#### Install iOS App on Device

Silently installs an IPA file on one or more attached iOS devices. This
ensures that your tests run against the latest version of your app.

**Note**: there is no Android version of this build step, because the
Android SDK already provides this functionality ("adb install").

#### Play Composition

Executes a CloudTest composition, and saves the output in the build's
test results. You can include this build step multiple times if there
are multiple compositions in your test suite.

#### Start Grid

Starts the grid with the specified CloudTest server, and name, and
ensures that the object reaches a ready status. In the event that the
grid fails to reach a ready status, it will be torn down and the build
step will fail.

#### Stop Grid

Terminates the grid, and ensures that the grid reaches a terminated
status. In the event that the grid fails to reach a terminated status,
the build step will fail.

#### Start RSDB

Starts the RSDB with the specified CloudTest server, and name, and
ensures that the RSDB reaches a ready status. In the event that the RSDB
fails to reach a ready status, it will be torn down and the build step
will fail.

#### Stop RSDB

Terminates the RSDB, and ensures that the RSDB reaches a terminated
status. In the event that the grid fails to reach a terminated status,
the build step will fail.

#### Test Environments

Note that for test environments you will need to set up a CloudTest
Server to point to CloudTest Manager
<https://cloudtestmanager.soasta.com/concerto/>.

#### Start Test Environment

Starts the test environment with the specified CloudTest server (Note
this MUST be CTM), and name, and ensures that the object reaches a ready
status. In the event that the test environment fails to reach a ready
status, it will be torn down and the build step will fail.

#### Stop Test Environment

Terminates the test environment, and ensures that the test environment
reaches a terminated status. In the event that the test environment
fails to reach a terminated status, the build step will fail.

#### Wake Up iOS Device

Wakes up one or more attached iOS devices, and opens Mobile Safari to
the most recently-viewed page (e.g. TouchTest Agent). This can
optionally be used at the beginning of a build, to "prep" the devices
for testing.

**Note:** There is no Android version of this build step, because the
Android SDK already provides this functionality.

#### Reboot iOS Device

Reboots one or more attached iOS devices. This can optionally be used at
the end of a build, to "reset" for the next one.

**Note**: There is no Android version of this build step, because the
Android SDK already provides this functionality ("adb reboot").

* "Play Composition(s)" build step now includes the ability to
  generate CSV output.

### Version 2.18 (released July 9, 2014)

### Version 2.5 (released November 08, 2013)

* Issue where CloudTest servers were not being detected correctly has
  been resolved.
* New "Additional Options" input for the "Play Composition(s)" build
  step.  Any values entered here will be passed directly to SCommand.
* Server configurations are now managed using a unique ID and friendly
  name, instead of being bound to the URL.  This means that you can
  use multiple CloudTest accounts with a single server (e.g. for
  concurrent builds), and can change the URL for a server
  configuration without affecting existing jobs.

### Version 2.4 (released June 25, 2013)

* The "Run App in iOS Simulator" build step now works correctly when
  only a single CloudTest server has been configured.
