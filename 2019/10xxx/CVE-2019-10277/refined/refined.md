Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10277:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10277

**Vulnerability Description:**

The `starteam` plugin for Jenkins stores credentials in plain text within the `config.xml` files associated with jobs on the Jenkins controller. This vulnerability allows users with either Extended Read permissions or access to the Jenkins controller's file system to view the unencrypted credentials.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is the storage of sensitive credentials in plain text within job configuration files. The plugin lacks proper encryption or secure handling of these credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The primary vulnerability is storing sensitive data (credentials) in an unencrypted format.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The vulnerability is exacerbated by the fact that these configuration files are accessible to users with Extended Read permissions or direct file system access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker gaining access to the stored credentials could compromise the accounts and services protected by those credentials.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker could potentially use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to connected systems or services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Jenkins Account:** An attacker with a Jenkins account that has "Extended Read" permissions can view the unencrypted credentials.
*   **Direct File System Access:** An attacker with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can directly read the configuration files and obtain the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Jenkins User with Extended Read Permissions:** The attacker needs a Jenkins account with at least Extended Read permissions.
*   **File System Access:** The attacker could also have direct access to the server's filesystem where Jenkins is installed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability exists in `starteam` plugin versions up to and including 0.6.13.
*   The Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-04-03 lists this vulnerability along with many other plugins with similar issues.
*   The `starteam` plugin distribution has been suspended from the Jenkins plugin repository.
