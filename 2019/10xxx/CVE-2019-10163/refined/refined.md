Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-10163:

**CVE-2019-10163**

*   **Root Cause:** The PowerDNS Authoritative Server, when configured as a slave, is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack caused by receiving a large number of NOTIFY messages from an authorized master server. The server does not properly handle the influx of these messages, leading to high CPU load or preventing further zone updates.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Insufficient rate-limiting or processing of incoming NOTIFY messages.
    *   Slave servers are susceptible when receiving a high number of NOTIFY packets.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of service of slave servers, resulting in high CPU load.
    *   Prevention of further updates to slave zones
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Sending a large number of NOTIFY packets from an authorized master server to a vulnerable slave server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have a server authorized as a master for a zone that a vulnerable server is configured as a slave for.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send NOTIFY messages to the vulnerable slave server.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects PowerDNS Authoritative Server up to and including version 4.1.8.
*   Versions 4.1.9 and 4.0.8 are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   The issue was found and reported by George Asenov.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which only mentions "A Vulnerability has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server before versions 4.1.9, 4.0.8 allowing a remote, authorized master server to cause a high CPU load or even prevent any further updates to any slave zone by sending a large number of NOTIFY messages. Note that only servers configured as slaves are affected by this issue."
