Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The `config.FunctionName` from user-supplied input is directly used to construct a command line string without any sanitization, and then executed by the `exec` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization or validation on `config.FunctionName`, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the executed shell command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the vulnerable code is running. This can lead to a full system compromise and allow for malicious activities like:
    *   Data exfiltration
    *   Malware installation
    *   Denial of service
    *   Privilege escalation

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `config.FunctionName` parameter of the `aws-lambda` tool. The attacker needs to manipulate a configuration file or provide the malicious input through the command line interface to trigger the execution of injected commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide or manipulate the configuration file that's used by `aws-lambda` tool, specifically the `FunctionName` parameter.
*   No user interaction is required for exploitation.
*   The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack, implying a remote exploitation is possible, and the attacker does not need any privileges to exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Package:** `aws-lambda` npm package
*   **Affected Versions:**  Versions prior to 1.0.5
*   **Proof of Concept:** A simple proof of concept was provided using the config file, showcasing the command injection vulnerability:
```
// aws-lambda-config.lambda
{"FunctionName": "& touch Song &",
"PATH": "./"}
```
*  **Fix:** Upgrade to version 1.0.5 or higher, which presumably addresses the vulnerability through proper input sanitization or use of safe execution methods.
*   **CVSS Score:** The content mentions CVSS scores from both Snyk and NVD:
    *   Snyk: 7.5 (High)
    *   NVD: 9.8 (Critical)
*   **CWE:** CWE-78 (OS Command Injection)
