Yesterday, I published about Mint's 1.6.3 being vulnerable to the same flaw that I reported to Xiaomi, even after Xiaomi pushed a fix on the 5th of April, 2019. The fix could be bypassed with little effort neatly.

   "The vulnerability impacts millions of users globally yet the bounty offered as such was, $99 (for Mi Browser) and another $99 (for Mint Browser)."

   In all fairness, the most common reward around here is a customized FU followed by a keep your mouth shut "or else". Really puts into perspective those $99.
