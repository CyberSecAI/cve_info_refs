The provided content is related to CVE-2019-10305.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The XebiaLabs XL Deploy Plugin had a missing permission check in a form validation method.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission check: The form validation method lacked proper authorization checks, allowing users with Overall/Read permissions to access functionality that should have been restricted.
- CSRF: The form validation method didn't require POST requests, making it vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Users with Overall/Read permissions could initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server using attacker-specified credentials. This could allow an attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to the targeted server.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious request to the vulnerable form validation method, exploiting the lack of a permission check to trigger a connection test to an arbitrary server.
- CSRF could be exploited by tricking a user with Overall/Read permissions to click on a malicious link or visit a malicious page, which would send a forged request to the vulnerable endpoint and perform the connection test on an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have at least Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft or induce the victim to submit a malicious request to the vulnerable form validation method.
