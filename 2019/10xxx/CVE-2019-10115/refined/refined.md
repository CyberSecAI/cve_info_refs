Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper authorization checks in the GitLab API and release page. Guest users, who should not have access to the project's code, were able to access release information. Releases, while tied to git tags and containing similar information, were not properly protected, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** Guest users were not restricted from accessing release information through both the web interface and the API.
*   **API Vulnerability:** The API endpoints (`/api/v4/<project-id>/releases` and `/api/v4/<project-id>/releases/:tag_name`) lacked proper authorization checks, allowing guest users to retrieve release data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Guest users could access private release information such as:
    *   Tag names
    *   Release descriptions
    *   Commit details
    *   Author information
    *   Links to source code archives
*   **Potential Security Risks:** Exposure of release information can reveal internal security practices or provide insights to potential attackers about vulnerabilities being addressed in specific releases.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface Access:** A guest user could navigate directly to the release page using the URL.
*   **API Access:** A guest user could send API requests with a valid guest token to retrieve release data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Guest User Status:** The attacker needs to be a guest user of the private project.
*   **GitLab Instance Access:** Access to the GitLab instance where the vulnerable project resides is required.
*   **Guest User Token:** For API exploitation, the attacker requires a valid guest user token.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported via HackerOne.
*   The fix involves implementing proper authorization checks for both the API and the web interface release page.
*   The example JSON output demonstrates the type of information exposed to guest users.
