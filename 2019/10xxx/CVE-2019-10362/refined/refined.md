Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10362:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The Configuration as Code plugin allowed variable references (e.g., `${VARIABLE_NAME}`) within the exported configuration YAML file. These references are meant to be interpolated with their corresponding environment variable values during import. The vulnerability arose because the export process did not escape these variable references, specifically in descriptions of certain entities (credentials, agents etc.).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unescaped Variable References:** The primary weakness was the lack of escaping variable references during export. This meant that a crafted description containing `${VARIABLE}` would not be exported as `^${VARIABLE}`, thus enabling interpolation when re-imported.
*   **Variable Interpolation on Import:** The plugin's import feature automatically interpolates the variable references with environment variable values upon re-import, if they are not escaped.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure/Modification:** An attacker with permission to configure entities could inject crafted descriptions containing variable references. During a subsequent import, these references would be replaced with potentially sensitive environment variable values. The could lead to:
    *   Exposure of sensitive information such as secrets.
    *   Potentially modifying the imported configuration with the values of environment variables, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Descriptions:** An attacker would need to craft descriptions of entities (credentials, agents, etc.) with unescaped variable references.
*   **Export/Import Cycle:** The attacker needs to be able to trigger an export and import of the configuration.
*   **Environment Variables:** The vulnerability leverages the existence of environment variables that the attacker can potentially control, or is interested in exposing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Permissions to Configure Entities:** The attacker needs permissions to configure certain entities (credentials, agents etc.) where they can insert the variable references in the descriptions.
*   **Trigger Import:** The attacker would either need to be able to import the configuration or cause an administrator to import the crafted configuration.
*   **Overall/Read Access:** The attacker needs access to the Jenkins system with at least overall/read access (as this is required to configure entities).
