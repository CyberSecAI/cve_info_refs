Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10405:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Jenkins displayed technical information about the current user on the `/whoAmI` URL, including HTTP request headers. This included the `Cookie` header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Exposure:** The `/whoAmI` page exposed sensitive information (HTTP headers) that could be leveraged by attackers.
*   **Lack of proper header filtering:** The application displayed the `Cookie` header, which should have been filtered out for security reasons, specifically due to the presence of sensitive session information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could leverage a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to extract the `Cookie` header from the `/whoAmI` output. With the `Cookie` value, an attacker can impersonate a user, gaining access to the application with the privileges of the user. This is especially problematic with highly privileged user sessions.
*   The HttpOnly flag, intended to protect cookies from JavaScript access, was bypassed by exfiltrating the cookie via the `/whoAmI` endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary attack vector involved leveraging a pre-existing XSS vulnerability within the Jenkins application.
*   **Targeted endpoint access**: Attackers would need to trigger the vulnerable XSS to redirect to the `/whoAmI` page, and exfiltrate the `Cookie` header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Exploitable XSS:** Attackers required an existing XSS vulnerability within Jenkins. They would need the ability to inject malicious script into a Jenkins page that is viewable by the target user.
*   **Target user interaction:** The target user must visit the page with the injected XSS payload.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is described as "Diagnostic web page exposed Cookie HTTP header."
*   The fix involves Jenkins no longer displaying the value of the `Cookie` HTTP header on the `/whoAmI` URL.
*   The severity is rated as Medium, with a CVSS score of 5.4 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N).
