# Twitter

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Credentials stored in plain text](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-04-30/#SECURITY-1143)

* [Documentation](/twitter/)
* [Releases](/twitter/releases/)
* [Issues](/twitter/issues/)
* [Dependencies](/twitter/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/twitter/healthscore/)

This plugin posts build results to Twitter.Each Twitter update will
contain build result, its build number, and job name. Optionally, the
build URL can be included in which case it will be run through
tinyurl.com. See [the demo user](http://twitter.com/mtvn_builds)
([other](https://twitter.com/jhudson_bot)).

The Twitter plugin uses the configuration of the core Mailer in order to
determine the build URL.

This plugin uses
[Twitter4J](http://yusuke.homeip.net/twitter4j/en/index.html), created
by [Yusuke Yamamoto](http://yusuke.homeip.net/diary/).

[Download](https://hudson.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=9184&expandFolder=9184&folderID=5818)
.

**Setup**

After the plugin is installed you will need to get an OAuth token and
token secret. These can be gotten by logging into Twitter as the user
you want Hudson to tweet as and then download

[auth-0.8.jar](https://wiki.jenkins.io/download/attachments/25591848/auth-0.8.jar?version=1&modificationDate=1404317428000&api=v2)

Then execute ***java -jar auth.jar***. This will give you a URL to
authorize Hudson to tweet with this user account. Twitter will then give
you a pin to give to auth.jar. Then you will be presented with a Token
and TokenSecret. Copy these into the appropriate fields in your Hudson
setup.

SECURITY-1100 / CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to
display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis
Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of
each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a
permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the
per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and
POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

SECURITY-930 / CVE-2019-10317
SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for
the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that. Instead, it now has an opt-in option
to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

SECURITY-1252 / CVE-2019-10309
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover
Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser
in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows
unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a
maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary
files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1355 (1) / CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)
Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer
permissions.

SECURITY-1355 (2) / CVE-2019-10312
Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be
used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1390 / CVE-2019-10318
Azure AD Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global config.xml
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Azure AD Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

SECURITY-1143 / CVE-2019-10313
Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file
on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-936 / CVE-2019-10314
Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-443 / CVE-2019-10315
GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to
prevent CSRF. This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided
during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim. If
the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be
attached to the attacker’s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

SECURITY-1380 / CVE-2019-10316
Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |
