Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10371:

**CVE-2019-10371**

*   **Root Cause:** The Gitlab Authentication Plugin does not invalidate the existing HTTP session upon successful login, and instead reuses it.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Session fixation vulnerability.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has access to a user's pre-login session ID can impersonate that user.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker needs to obtain a victim's session ID before they log in. This could happen through various methods, such as:
        *   Man-in-the-middle attacks.
        *   Malware on the victim's machine.
        *   Social engineering tactics that trick the user into revealing their session ID.
    *   The attacker then uses the captured session ID to access the Jenkins instance, impersonating the victim user.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to obtain the pre-login session ID of a targeted user.
    *   The attacker does not need any specific privileges or authentication to obtain the session ID. They can be external.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability exists in the GitLab Authentication Plugin up to version 1.4.
*   No fix was available at the time of the advisory.
