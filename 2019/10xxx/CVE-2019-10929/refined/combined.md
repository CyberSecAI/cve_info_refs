SSA-273799: Message Integrity Protection Bypass Vulnerability in
SIMATIC Products

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 3.7

SUMMARY

A message integrity protection bypass vulnerability has been identiﬁed in several SIMATIC products. The
vulnerability could allow an attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle position to modify network trafﬁc exchanged
on port 102/tcp to PLCs of the SIMATIC S7-1200, SIMATIC S7-1500 and SIMATIC SoftwareController
CPU families.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10929

Affected devices contain a message protection bypass vulnerability due to certain properties in the
calculation used for integrity protection.

This could allow an attacker in a Man-in-the-Middle position to modify network trafﬁc sent on port
102/tcp to the affected devices.

V1.4

SUMMARY

Two vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in the SIMATIC S7-1200/S7-1500 CPU families and related
products. One vulnerability (CVE-2019-10943) could allow an attacker with network access to affected
devices to modify the user program stored on these devices such that the source code differs from the
actual running code. The other vulnerability (CVE-2019-10929) could allow an attacker in a Man-in-the-
Middle position to modify network trafﬁc exchanged on port 102/tcp.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products to ﬁx CVE-2019-10929 and recommends to
update to the latest versions. Regarding CVE-2019-10943, Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermea-
sures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC Drive Controllers have been designed for the automation of production machines, combining
the functionality of a SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU and a SINAMICS S120 drive control.

SIMATIC ET 200SP Open Controller is a PC-based version of the SIMATIC S7-1500 Controller including
optional visualization in combination with central I/Os in a compact device.

SIMATIC S7-1200 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 CPU products have been designed for discrete and continuous control in industrial
environments such as manufacturing, food and beverages, and chemical industries worldwide.

SIMATIC S7-1500 Software Controller is a SIMATIC software controller for PC-based automation solutions.

SIMATIC S7-PLCSIM Advanced simulates S7-1200, S7-1500 and a few other PLC derivatives. Includes
full network access to simulate the PLCs, even in virtualized environments.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10943

An attacker with network access to port 102/tcp could potentially modify the user program on the PLC
in a way that the running code is different from the source code which is stored on the device.

An attacker must have network access to affected devices and must be able to perform changes to
the user program. The vulnerability could impact the perceived integrity of the user program stored on
the CPU. An engineer that tries to obtain the code of the user program running on the device, can
receive different source code that is not actually running on the device.
