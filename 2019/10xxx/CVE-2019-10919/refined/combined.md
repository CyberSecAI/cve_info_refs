Advisory ID: SYSS-2020-013
Product: LOGO!
Manufacturer: Siemens
Affected Version(s): LOGO! 8 (all versions)
Tested Version(s): LOGO! 8, 6ED1052-2MD00-0BA8 FS:03, 0BA8.Standard V1.08.03
Vulnerability Type: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CWE-306)
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2019-04-04
Solution Date: 2019-05-14 (recommended mitigation by manufacturer)
Public Disclosure: 2019-05-29
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-10919
Authors of Advisory: Manuel Stotz (SySS GmbH), Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Siemens LOGO! is a programmable logic controller (PLC) for small
automation tasks.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Simple installation, minimum wiring, user-friendly programming: You can
easily implement small automation projects with LOGO!, the intelligent
logic module from Siemens. The LOGO! Logic Module saves space in the
control cabinet, and lets you easily implement functions, such as
time-delay switches, time relays, counters and auxiliary relays. "

Due to storing passwords in a recoverable format on LOGO! 8 PLCs, an
attacker can gain access to configured passwords as cleartext.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the provided function "GetProfile" of a LOGO! 8
PLC that is for instance used by the software tool LOGO! Soft Comfort
does not require any authentication.

Thus, an attacker can send a "GetProfile" query to a LOGO! 8 PLC and
will receive the requested profile information containing sensitive
data such as different configured passwords.

This profile data is encrypted - but it is encrypted via 3DES using a
static, hard-coded cryptographic key, which is described in the SySS
security advisory SYSS-2019-012 [2]. So, by knowing this 3DES key, an
attacker can simply decrypt all sensitive data and use the contained
cleartext passwords (see SySS security advisory SYSS-2019-014 [3]) in
further attacks.

Furthermore, SySS GmbH found out that the provided function for setting
password data on a LOGO! 8 PLC can also be used without any
authentication. Therefore, an attacker can simply set arbitrary
passwords by sending a specific request to the LOGO! 8 PLC via the
network.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH could successfully extract sensitive data such as configured
passwords as cleartext from a LOGO! 8 using a developed Nmap script.

The following Nmap output exemplarily shows extracting cleartext
password data from a LOGO! 8 PLC:

$ nmap -p 10005 --script slig.nse 192.168.10.112
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( <https://nmap.org> ) at 2019-04-04 09:35 CEST
Nmap scan report for 192.168.10.112

A successful attack against a LOGO! 8 extracting all configured
passwords is demonstrated in our SySS PoC video [7].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

In the publicly released Siemens Security Advisory SSA-542701 [3],
the manufacturer Siemens recommends to apply a defense-in-depth concept,
including protection concept outlined in the system manual, as a
mitigation for reducing the risk of the described security issue.

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in SIEMENS LOGO!8 BM devices. The most severe vulnera-
bility could lead to an attacker reading and modifying the device conﬁguration if the attacker has access
to port 10005/tcp.

Siemens has released an update for the LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants) and recommends that
customers update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants):
All versions < V8.3

Update to V8.3. Notice that in order to update, a
new hardware version is required.

view/109783346/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply Defense-in-Depth concept, including protection concept outlined in the system manual.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

SSA-542701

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10919

Attackers with access to port 10005/tcp could perform device reconﬁgurations and obtain project ﬁles
from the devices. The system manual recommends to protect access to this port.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to
port 10005/tcp. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. The vulnerability
impacts conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.

Overview:

Siemens LOGO! is a programmable logic controller (PLC) for small

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Simple installation, minimum wiring, user-friendly programming: You can
easily implement small automation projects with LOGO!, the intelligent

Due to storing passwords in a recoverable format on LOGO! 8 PLCs, an
attacker can gain access to configured passwords as cleartext.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that the provided function "GetProfile" of a LOGO! 8

Thus, an attacker can send a "GetProfile" query to a LOGO! 8 PLC and

This profile data is encrypted - but it is encrypted via 3DES using a
