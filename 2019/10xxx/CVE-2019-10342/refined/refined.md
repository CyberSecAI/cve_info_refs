Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10342:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Docker Plugin did not properly check permissions when providing a list of applicable credential IDs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Missing permission check:** The plugin failed to verify if the user had the necessary permissions to access the list of credential IDs.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed unauthorized users to enumerate valid credential IDs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker with Overall/Read access to Jenkins could obtain a list of valid credential IDs.
- This list of IDs could be used to exploit other vulnerabilities (specifically CVE-2019-10340/10341) in the plugin to capture the credentials themselves.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can access the plugin's functionality that lists credential IDs.
- This does not require any user interaction outside of accessing Jenkins.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read access to the Jenkins instance.
- No specific user interaction is needed for this attack to work.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.7 of the Docker Plugin.
- The advisory links this CVE to "another vulnerability", which is likely CVE-2019-10340 and CVE-2019-10341, where the credentials could be captured.
