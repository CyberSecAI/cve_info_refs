Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A malicious version of the `bootstrap-sass` Ruby gem (version 3.2.0.3) was published to the official RubyGems repository, containing a backdoor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The backdoor allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on servers running vulnerable versions of the gem.
- **Code Injection:** The vulnerability arises from the gem's modification of the `Rack::Sendfile` middleware.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The code extracts a value from the `___cfduid` HTTP cookie, decodes it using Base64, and executes it with `eval()`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers could steal sensitive data, including database credentials, API keys, and other confidential information.
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers can cause a denial of service by crashing the application or consuming resources.
- **Malware Installation:** Attackers could install malware, including ransomware, onto the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by injecting a Base64-encoded payload into the `___cfduid` HTTP cookie of a request to the affected server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **No Prior Authentication:** No prior authentication or access to the server is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The malicious code resides in `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb` within the `bootstrap-sass` gem.
- It modifies the `call` method of `Rack::Sendfile` in production environments.
- The modified method extracts the `___cfduid` cookie, decodes it using Base64, and executes the resulting code using `eval()`.
- The code is executed within the context of the Rails application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The malicious version (3.2.0.3) was published after the previous version (3.2.0.2) was yanked from the RubyGems repository by the attacker to force users to upgrade to the malicious version.
- The maintainers quickly removed the malicious version and republished a clean version (3.2.0.4) to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability affects applications using `bootstrap-sass` that run in a production environment.
- The Snyk vulnerability ID for this issue is `SNYK-RUBY-BOOTSTRAPSASS-174093`.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE-2019-10842.
