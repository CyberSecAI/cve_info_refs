  "CVE-2019-10125": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The Linux kernel's aio subsystem has a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs because the file may be released by aio_poll_wake() if an expected event is triggered immediately after the return of vfs_poll()",
    "root_cause": "The file structure referenced by the aio subsystem can be released by aio_poll_wake() immediately after vfs_poll() returns if an expected event occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A use-after-free vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service or information disclosure.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger the race condition by creating pipes and using the aio_poll() syscall",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to call the aio_poll() syscall. No special privileges are required."
