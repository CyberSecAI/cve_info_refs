### Relevant Information for CVE-2019-10442:
- **Vulnerability:** Missing permission check and CSRF
- **Affected Plugin:** iceScrum Plugin
- **Description:** The iceScrum Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation, allowing users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server with attacker-specified access token or username and password.
  Additionally, the form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
- **Attack Vector:** A user with Overall/Read access to Jenkins can initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified server using attacker-specified access token or username and password due to missing permission checks. The CSRF vulnerability is due to the form validation method not requiring POST requests.
- **Impact:** An attacker can initiate connection tests to arbitrary servers with attacker-specified credentials.
- **Fix:** The iceScrum Plugin now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permission.
