## CVE-2019-10320

Based on the provided information, here's a summary of the vulnerability:

- **Vulnerability:** Certificate file read
- **Affected Software:** Jenkins Credentials Plugin (versions 2.1.18 and earlier)
- **Root Cause:** Missing permission check and lack of input validation during the creation of Certificate credentials from a PKCS#12 file.
- **Attack Vector:**
  - Users with permission to create or update credentials could use the form validation to check for the existence of arbitrary files on the Jenkins master.
  - Attackers could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins master and, by configuring jobs to access these credentials, obtain the certificate content.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission to access the Jenkins instance, and permission to create or update credentials. Anonymous users typically do not have these privileges.
- **Impact:**
  - Information Disclosure: Attackers can confirm the existence of arbitrary files on the Jenkins master.
  - Sensitive Data Exposure: Attackers can obtain the content of valid PKCS#12 files stored on the Jenkins master, potentially exposing private keys and other sensitive information.
- **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Credentials Plugin version 2.1.19 or later. This version removes the ability to create Certificate credentials from PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins master. Existing credentials of this type are automatically migrated.

The advisory also notes a potential issue with migrated credentials requiring manual saving in rare situations.
