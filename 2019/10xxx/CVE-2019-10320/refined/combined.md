Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following
releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* Credentials 2.1.19
* PAM Authentication 1.5.1

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-05-21/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1316 / CVE-2019-10319
A missing permission check in PAM Authentication Plugin allowed users with
Overall/Read permission to invoke a form validation method to obtain
limited information about the file /etc/shadow on systems with that file
present, as well as the system user the Jenkins process is running as.

SECURITY-1322 / CVE-2019-10320
Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials from a
PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins master. Users with permission to create or
update credentials could use the associated form validation to confirm the
existence of files with an attacker-specified path.

Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on
the Jenkins master. With the ability to configure jobs to access these
credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.

```

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1716794#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-06-04 06:30:24 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

# Exploring the File System via Jenkins Credentials Plugin Vulnerability – CVE-2019-10320

[May 23, 2019May 24, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/05/23/exploring-the-file-system-via-jenkins-credentials-plugin-vulnerability-cve-2019-10320/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)[cve-2019-10320](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/cve-2019-10320/), [jenkins](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/jenkins/)

## Summary

The recently fixed vulnerability in the Jenkins Credentials plugin (fixed in v2.1.19) allowed users with certain permissions to confirm existence of a file on the server’s file system. While this doesn’t allow an attacker to view the file content, the ability to obtain information about the file system can be leveraged for other attacks. In this post we will explain how to reproduce this vulnerability.

It is also possible to load credentials from a valid PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins server, and obtain access to the contents of those credentials via a job. That may be addressed in a future blog post.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is only exploitable by users that have sufficient access to the Jenkins server to add or update credentials. Usually anonymous users do not have that level of access.

## Prerequisites

You will need to [download](https://jenkins.io/download/), install and initialize Jenkins [following these instructions](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/). DO NOT install any plugin during the installation process. When done, you should be able to login to Jenkins via the following URL: “**<http://localhost:8080/>**“.

## Installing the Vulnerable Plugin

1. Download the vulnerable plugin (v2.1.18) from [the Jenkins update site](https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/credentials/) as an HPI file:

![updatesite](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/updatesite-1.png?w=700)

2. Go to the Jenkins plugin manager, and click the advanced tab (“**<http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/advanced>**“) to get to the manual plugin installation page. Select the HPI file downloaded in the previous step and install it. Restart the Jenkins server (“**<http://localhost:8080/restart>**“) after the plugin has been installed.

![plugin](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin.png?w=700)

3. Login to the Jenkins management page (“**<http://localhost:8080/manage>**“) and plugin manager (“**<http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/>**“) to confirm that the vulnerable plugin has been installed.

![manage](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/manage.png?w=700)

![plugin](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin-1.png?w=700)

## Getting to the Vulnerable Page

1. Login to Jenkins, then go to “Credentials”, “System”, “Global Credentials”. Click the new option “Add Credentials” that appears on the left side. The user that you are using MUST have sufficient permissions to add or update credentials. You can also reach this page by going directly to “**<http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials>**“.

2. In the “Kind” drop down box select “Certificate”, and from the two radio buttons select “From a PKCS#12 file on Jenkins master”.

## Exploitation

Put in a valid path in the “file” box and click anywhere in the page to refresh. You will get an error message “**The file xxxx doesn’t exists**” if the file is not present, OR “C**ould not load keystore**” if the file does exists. This would allow an attacker to explore the file system and confirm whether specific files exist or not. While file content cannot be viewed (unless they are PKCS#12 files), the attacker can use this technique to help advance other attacks.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1719782#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-06-12 14:35:01 UTC  ``` Token Macro Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allowed attackers able to control the contents of files processed with the ${XML} macro to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins agent, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks. Token Macro Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

# Exploring the File System via Jenkins Credentials Plugin Vulnerability – CVE-2019-10320

[May 23, 2019May 24, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/05/23/exploring-the-file-system-via-jenkins-credentials-plugin-vulnerability-cve-2019-10320/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)[cve-2019-10320](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/cve-2019-10320/), [jenkins](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/jenkins/)

## Summary

The recently fixed vulnerability in the Jenkins Credentials plugin (fixed in v2.1.19) allowed users with certain permissions to confirm existence of a file on the server’s file system. While this doesn’t allow an attacker to view the file content, the ability to obtain information about the file system can be leveraged for other attacks. In this post we will explain how to reproduce this vulnerability.

It is also possible to load credentials from a valid PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins server, and obtain access to the contents of those credentials via a job. That may be addressed in a future blog post.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is only exploitable by users that have sufficient access to the Jenkins server to add or update credentials. Usually anonymous users do not have that level of access.

## Prerequisites

You will need to [download](https://jenkins.io/download/), install and initialize Jenkins [following these instructions](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/). DO NOT install any plugin during the installation process. When done, you should be able to login to Jenkins via the following URL: “**<http://localhost:8080/>**“.

## Installing the Vulnerable Plugin

1. Download the vulnerable plugin (v2.1.18) from [the Jenkins update site](https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/credentials/) as an HPI file:

![updatesite](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/updatesite-1.png?w=700)

2. Go to the Jenkins plugin manager, and click the advanced tab (“**<http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/advanced>**“) to get to the manual plugin installation page. Select the HPI file downloaded in the previous step and install it. Restart the Jenkins server (“**<http://localhost:8080/restart>**“) after the plugin has been installed.

![plugin](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin.png?w=700)

3. Login to the Jenkins management page (“**<http://localhost:8080/manage>**“) and plugin manager (“**<http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/>**“) to confirm that the vulnerable plugin has been installed.

![plugin](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin-1.png?w=700)

## Getting to the Vulnerable Page

1. Login to Jenkins, then go to “Credentials”, “System”, “Global Credentials”. Click the new option “Add Credentials” that appears on the left side. The user that you are using MUST have sufficient permissions to add or update credentials. You can also reach this page by going directly to “**<http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials>**“.

2. In the “Kind” drop down box select “Certificate”, and from the two radio buttons select “From a PKCS#12 file on Jenkins master”.

## Exploitation

Put in a valid path in the “file” box and click anywhere in the page to refresh. You will get an error message “**The file xxxx doesn’t exists**” if the file is not present, OR “C**ould not load keystore**” if the file does exists. This would allow an attacker to explore the file system and confirm whether specific files exist or not. While file content cannot be viewed (unless they are PKCS#12 files), the attacker can use this technique to help advance other attacks.

nmap — Network exploration tool and security / port scanner

## Synopsis

`nmap` [
*`<Scan Type>`*
...] [
*`<Options>`*
] {
*`<target specification>`*
}

## Description

| [Note] | Note |
| --- | --- |
| This document describes the very latest version of Nmap available from [`https://nmap.org/download.html`](https://nmap.org/download.html) or [`https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D`](https://nmap.org/dist/?C=M&O=D). Please ensure you are using the latest version before reporting that a feature doesn't work as described. |

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other
characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for security audits,
many systems and network administrators find it useful for routine
tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.

The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with
supplemental information on each depending on the options
used. Key among that information is the “interesting ports
table”.
That table lists the port number and protocol,
service name, and state. The state is either
`open`, `filtered`,
`closed`, or `unfiltered`.
`Open`
means that an application on the target machine is listening for
connections/packets on that port.
`Filtered`
means that a firewall, filter, or other network
obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap cannot tell whether it is
`open` or `closed`.
`Closed`
ports have no application listening on them,
though they could open up at any time.
Ports are classified as
`unfiltered`
when they are
responsive to Nmap's probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are
open or closed.
Nmap reports the state combinations
`open|filtered`
and `closed|filtered`
when it cannot determine which
of the two states describe a port. The port table may also
include software version details when version detection has been
requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
(`-sO`), Nmap provides information on supported IP
protocols rather than listening ports.

In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide
further information on targets, including reverse DNS names,
operating system guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.

A typical Nmap scan is shown in [Example 15.1](man.html#man-ex-repscan "Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan"). The only Nmap arguments used in
this example are `-A`, to enable OS and version
detection, script scanning, and traceroute; `-T4` for
faster execution; and then the hostname.

Example 15.1. A representative Nmap scan
```
# nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# Exploring the File System via Jenkins Credentials Plugin Vulnerability – CVE-2019-10320

[May 23, 2019May 24, 2019](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/05/23/exploring-the-file-system-via-jenkins-credentials-plugin-vulnerability-cve-2019-10320/) [nightwatchcyber](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/author/nightwatchcyber/)
[Research](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/category/research/)[cve-2019-10320](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/cve-2019-10320/), [jenkins](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/tag/jenkins/)

## Summary

The recently fixed vulnerability in the Jenkins Credentials plugin (fixed in v2.1.19) allowed users with certain permissions to confirm existence of a file on the server’s file system. While this doesn’t allow an attacker to view the file content, the ability to obtain information about the file system can be leveraged for other attacks. In this post we will explain how to reproduce this vulnerability.

It is also possible to load credentials from a valid PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins server, and obtain access to the contents of those credentials via a job. That may be addressed in a future blog post.

**PLEASE NOTE:** This is only exploitable by users that have sufficient access to the Jenkins server to add or update credentials. Usually anonymous users do not have that level of access.

## Prerequisites

You will need to [download](https://jenkins.io/download/), install and initialize Jenkins [following these instructions](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/). DO NOT install any plugin during the installation process. When done, you should be able to login to Jenkins via the following URL: “**<http://localhost:8080/>**“.

## Installing the Vulnerable Plugin

1. Download the vulnerable plugin (v2.1.18) from [the Jenkins update site](https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/credentials/) as an HPI file:

![updatesite](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/updatesite-1.png?w=700)

2. Go to the Jenkins plugin manager, and click the advanced tab (“**<http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/advanced>**“) to get to the manual plugin installation page. Select the HPI file downloaded in the previous step and install it. Restart the Jenkins server (“**<http://localhost:8080/restart>**“) after the plugin has been installed.

![plugin](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin.png?w=700)

3. Login to the Jenkins management page (“**<http://localhost:8080/manage>**“) and plugin manager (“**<http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/>**“) to confirm that the vulnerable plugin has been installed.

![manage](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/manage.png?w=700)

![plugin](https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/plugin-1.png?w=700)

## Getting to the Vulnerable Page

1. Login to Jenkins, then go to “Credentials”, “System”, “Global Credentials”. Click the new option “Add Credentials” that appears on the left side. The user that you are using MUST have sufficient permissions to add or update credentials. You can also reach this page by going directly to “**<http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials>**“.

2. In the “Kind” drop down box select “Certificate”, and from the two radio buttons select “From a PKCS#12 file on Jenkins master”.

## Exploitation

Put in a valid path in the “file” box and click anywhere in the page to refresh. You will get an error message “**The file xxxx doesn’t exists**” if the file is not present, OR “C**ould not load keystore**” if the file does exists. This would allow an attacker to explore the file system and confirm whether specific files exist or not. While file content cannot be viewed (unless they are PKCS#12 files), the attacker can use this technique to help advance other attacks.

# Exploring the File System via Jenkins Credentials Plugin Vulnerability – CVE-2019-10320

---

*From*: Nightwatch Cybersecurity Research <research () nightwatchcybersecurity com>

[Original blog post here:
<https://wwws.nightwatchcybersecurity.com/2019/05/23/exploring-the-file-system-via-jenkins-credentials-plugin-vulnerability-cve-2019-10320/>]

SUMMARY

The recently fixed vulnerability in the Jenkins Credentials plugin
(v2.1.19) allowed users with certain permissions to confirm existence
of a file on the server’s file system. While this doesn’t allow an
attacker to view the file content, the ability to obtain information
about the file system can be leveraged for other attacks. In this post
we will explain how to reproduce this vulnerability.

It is also possible to load credentials from a valid PKCS#12 files on
the Jenkins server, and obtain access to the contents of those
credentials via a job. That may be addressed in a future blog post.

PLEASE NOTE: This is only exploitable by users that have sufficient
access to the Jenkins server to add or update credentials. Usually
anonymous users do not have that level of access.

PREREQUISITES

You will need to download, install and initialize Jenkins following
these instructions ("[https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/"](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/%22);). DO NOT
install any plugin during the installation process. When done, you
should be able to login to Jenkins via the following URL:
“[http://localhost:8080/“](http://localhost:8080/%E2%80%9C).

INSTALLING THE VULNERABLE PLUGIN

1. Download the vulnerable plugin (v2.1.18) from the Jenkins update
site as an HPI file
("[https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/credentials/"](https://updates.jenkins.io/download/plugins/credentials/%22);).

2. Go to the Jenkins plugin manager, and click the advanced tab
(“[http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/advanced“](http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/advanced%E2%80%9C)) to get to the manual
plugin installation page. Select the HPI file downloaded in the
previous step and install it. Restart the Jenkins server
(“[http://localhost:8080/restart“](http://localhost:8080/restart%E2%80%9C)) after the plugin has been installed.

3. Login to the Jenkins management page
(“[http://localhost:8080/manage“](http://localhost:8080/manage%E2%80%9C)) and plugin manager
(“[http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/“](http://localhost:8080/pluginManager/%E2%80%9C)) to confirm that the
vulnerable plugin has been installed.

GETTING TO THE VULNERABLE PAGE

1. Login to Jenkins, then go to “Credentials”, “System”, “Global
Credentials”. Click the new option “Add Credentials” that appears on
the left side. The user that you are using MUST have sufficient
permissions to add or update credentials. You can also reach this page
by going directly to
“[http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials“](http://localhost:8080/credentials/store/system/domain/_/newCredentials%E2%80%9C).

2. In the “Kind” drop down box select “Certificate”, and from the two
radio buttons select “From a PKCS#12 file on Jenkins master”.

EXPLOITATION

Put in a valid path in the “file” box and click anywhere in the page
to refresh. You will get an error message “The file xxxx doesn’t
exists” if the file is not present, OR “Could not load keystore” if
the file does exists. This would allow an attacker to explore the file
system and confirm whether specific files exist or not. While file
content cannot be viewed (unless they are PKCS#12 files), the attacker
can use this technique to help advance other attacks.

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-05-21

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* [Credentials
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials)
* [PAM Authentication
  Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pam-auth)

## Descriptions

### Missing permission check allowed obtaining limited information about system configuration in PAM Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-1316
/
CVE-2019-10319**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`pam-auth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pam-auth)**

**Description:**

A missing permission check in PAM Authentication Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to invoke a form validation method to obtain limited information about the file `/etc/shadow` on systems with that file present, as well as the system user the Jenkins process is running as.

Depending on configuration, one of the following messages could be obtained by an attacker:

* *"Jenkins needs to be able to read /etc/shadow"*
* *"(1) needs to belong to group (2) to read /etc/shadow"*
* *"Either Jenkins needs to run as (3) or (1) needs to belong to group (2) and 'chmod g+r /etc/shadow' needs to be done to enable Jenkins to read /etc/shadow"*
* *"Success"*

The numeric placeholders in the messages above would be populated with the following values:

1. The system user that the Jenkins controller process is running as (usually `jenkins`)
2. The group owning `/etc/shadow`
3. The user owning `/etc/shadow`

This form validation method now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Certificate file read vulnerability in Credentials Plugin

**SECURITY-1322
/
CVE-2019-10320**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`credentials`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/credentials)**

**Description:**

Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials from a PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins controller.
Users with permission to create or update credentials could use the associated form validation to confirm the existence of files with an attacker-specified path.

Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS#12 file on the Jenkins controller.
With the ability to configure jobs to access these credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.

Credentials Plugin no longer supports Certificate credentials from PKCS#12 files on the Jenkins controller file system.
Existing Certificate credentials of this kind are automatically migrated to *directly entered* Certificate credentials during Jenkins startup.

|  | Due to technical limitations, these migrated credentials are not immediately persisted. In rare situations a non-administrator user might access a credential migrated this way and encounter a permission error. The solution is to save affected credentials manually, either individually through the UI or with the following script for the Script Console:  ``` com.cloudbees.plugins.credentials.CredentialsProvider.saveAll() ```    This operation may impact performance.   In almost all cases the automatic migration will work and these additional steps will be unnecessary. |

  Plugin**
  up to and including
  2.1.18
* **PAM Authentication
  Plugin**
  up to and including
  1.5

## Fix

* **Credentials
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  2.1.19
* **PAM Authentication
  Plugin**
  should be updated to version
  1.5.1
