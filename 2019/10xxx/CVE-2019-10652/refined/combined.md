## Description

![@geeeez](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/29922543?u=78ba4b1f27bb80cc30f0d919188f32e7a1dfc12d&v=4&size=48)[geeeez](https://github.com/geeeez)opened [on Mar 29, 2019](https://github.com/flatCore/flatCore-CMS/issues/38#issue-426791616)

There are any files uploaded in the background of your website, you can upload PHP files, so that if the administrator password is leaked, the file uploaded through here can be directly getshell, take over the web

example:

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29922543/55206040-1d894300-5210-11e9-851b-37d846ebff42.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29922543/55206040-1d894300-5210-11e9-851b-37d846ebff42.png)

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29922543/55206005-034f6500-5210-11e9-9f48-3b8e5b0b0dad.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29922543/55206005-034f6500-5210-11e9-9f48-3b8e5b0b0dad.png)

I think you should limit the type of file you upload
