# Skytap Cloud CI

How to installThe Jenkins project announced an unresolved security vulnerability affecting the current version of this plugin ([why?](https://www.jenkins.io/security/plugins/#unresolved)):[Credentials transmitted in plain text](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-03-09/#SECURITY-1522)

* [Documentation](/skytap/)

* [Dependencies](/skytap/dependencies/)
* [Health Score](/skytap/healthscore/)

This plugin allows you to use Jenkins to run continuous integration and
automated testing workflows using dynamically-created development and
testing environments in [Skytap](http://www.skytap.com/)

Sections in this document:

# Introduction

The **Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins** allows you to create and
configure [Skytap Cloud](http://www.skytap.com/) environments as part of
your Jenkins-based continuous integration workflow.

In a matter of minutes, you can create a Skytap virtual environment from
a golden template and then use that environment to develop your
application or run test passes for unit testing, functional testing,
integration testing, stress/performance testing or user acceptance
testing. All of the VM and network settings are saved with the template,
so once you've created an environment, the network is already set up and
you're ready to go.

With **Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins**, you can add the following
actions to your Jenkins build steps:

# Before You Begin

To use the **Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins**, you must have a
Skytap account.

If you do not have a Skytap account, you can sign up for a demo account
at <http://www.skytap.com/>

# Step 1: Installing the Skytap Cloud CI Plugin for Jenkins

You can install the plugin from the Jenkins web UI, or you can download
the plugin from the plugin repository.

**Option 1:**

**To install the plugin from the Jenkins Web UI:**

# Step 2: Configuring the Plugin

To configure the plugin, you will need to enter to your Skytap
credentials. Optionally, you can also enable verbose logging.

1. To enter your Skytap credentials:## Navigate to the configuration
   page for your Jenkins build project.## Under **Build
   Environment**, enter your Skytap User ID and API security token.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/skytap/docs/images/jauth.jpg)

   NOTE: You can retrieve your user ID (user name) and API security
   token from your Skytap account settings page
   (<https://cloud.skytap.com/account>). If you do not have an API
   security token listed, use the instructions
   at <http://help.skytap.com/#Access_Policy.html> to enable API
   security tokens in your account.
2. To enable verbose logging for Skytap actions:##  Navigate to
   **Manage Jenkins** > **Configure System**.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/skytap/docs/images/sysconfig.jpg)##
   In the Skytap Cloud Plugin settings, select **Enable Console Logging
   of Skytap Actions**.

   Logs will be sent to the Jenkins Project build console.

   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jenkins-infra/plugins-wiki-docs/master/skytap/docs/images/logging.jpg)

# Step 3: Adding Skytap Actions to Your Build Steps

Once the plugin is installed and configured, you can add Skytap actions
to your Jenkins build steps:

1. Navigate to the Jenkins Project Configuration screen.
2. From the **Add build step** dropdown menu, select **Execute Skytap
   Action**.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1735515#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-01 03:18:59 UTC  ``` Sandbox protection in Jenkins Script Security Plugin could be circumvented by casting crafted objects to other types. This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to invoke constructors that weren’t whitelisted.  Additionally, this could be used to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins master.  Casting collections to other types as an alternative syntax for constructor invocation is now only allowed when the collection type is defined in java.util, and prohibited otherwise. Casting files and enums to arrays is now intercepted by the sandbox and treated as the invocation of an equivalent method.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1735521#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-01 03:32:58 UTC  ``` The Jenkins Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin provides form validation to determine whether the revision (e.g. commit, tag, or branch name) specified for a global library exists in the repository. This form validation method lacked a permission check, allowing attackers with Overall/Read access to determine whether an attacker-specified revision exists in an SCM repository configured for use in an existing shared library.  Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin now performs the appropriate permission check.

SECURITY-1465 (1) / CVE-2019-10355
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented by
casting crafted objects to other types. This allowed attackers able to
specify sandboxed scripts to invoke constructors that weren’t whitelisted.

Additionally, this could be used to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins
master.

SECURITY-1465 (2) / CVE-2019-10356
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
crafted subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions. This
allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary
code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1422 / CVE-2019-10357
Pipeline: Shared Groovy Libraries Plugin provides form validation to
determine whether the revision (e.g. commit, tag, or branch name) specified
for a global library exists in the repository. This form validation method
lacked a permission check, allowing attackers with Overall/Read access to
determine whether an attacker-specified revision exists in an SCM repository
configured for use in an existing shared library.

SECURITY-713 / CVE-2019-10358
Maven Integration Plugin did not apply build log decorators from the Build
Environment configuration to module builds. This could prevent sensitive
content in module build logs from being masked.

SECURITY-1098 / CVE-2019-10359
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to initiate the release process use POST. This resulted in a
cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to perform
releases.

SECURITY-1184 / CVE-2019-10360
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not properly escape variables in multiple
views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

SECURITY-1435 / CVE-2019-10361
Maven Release Plug-in Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global
configuration file org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.m2release.M2ReleaseBuildWrapper.
xml on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
access to the master file system.

SECURITY-1279 / CVE-2019-10343
Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins
system log. Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with
asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.

Between Configuration as Code Plugin 0.8-alpha and 1.0, log messages
contained values if the values were specified using properties in the YAML
file (SECURITY-929).
Since Configuration as Code Plugin 1.1, log messages in Configuration as
Code Plugin instead mask values of type Secret, which is used in Jenkins to
store the values encrypted on disk. This did not work in many instances, as
plugins could use the Secret type to store credentials encrypted on disk
while not having the Secret type appear in their Java API.

SECURITY-1290 / CVE-2019-10344
Configuration as Code Plugin provides a generated schema and reference
documentation for the configuration options supported on the current Jenkins
instance. These URLs did not perform additional permission checks, resulting
in their content being available to users with Overall/Read access. This
included detailed information about installed plugins that may not be
available otherwise.

SECURITY-1303 / CVE-2019-10345
Configuration as Code Plugin provides a custom configurator for the Jenkins
proxy configuration.

This feature did not mask the password for logging or encrypt it in the
export.

SECURITY-1446 / CVE-2019-10362
Configuration as Code Plugin allows exporting the live Jenkins
configuration, as well as importing and applying a configuration provided in
the same format. One of the features of the import is that it allows
specifying variable references (e.g. ${VARIABLE_NAME}) in the configuration
YAML file. These will be replaced by the value of the corresponding
environment variable (or other source of secrets) during import (
interpolation). If such a value should not be interpolated, the escape
character ^ can be used before (e.g. ^${VARIABLE_NAME}).

Exporting did not add ^ escape characters to exported strings, such as
various entity descriptions. This allowed attackers with permission to
configure certain entities, such as credentials or agents, to specify
crafted descriptions containing variable references. These would be replaced
by the corresponding environment variable’s value during a subsequent import.

SECURITY-1458 / CVE-2019-10363
Configuration as Code Plugin allows to export the current Jenkins
configuration as a YAML file. Secrets such as passwords should be exported
in their encrypted form to prevent accidental disclosure.

Configuration as Code Plugin did not reliably detect which values in the
exported YAML file need to be considered sensitive (e.g. credentials and
other secrets), as plugins could use the Secret type to store credentials
encrypted on disk while not having the Secret type appear in their Java API.
This resulted in credentials being exported in plain text in some cases.

SECURITY-673 / CVE-2019-10364
Amazon EC2 Plugin printed a log message that contained the beginning of the
private key to the Jenkins system log.

SECURITY-1345 / CVE-2019-10365
Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin created a temporary file named .kube…config
containing a temporary access token in the project workspace. This allowed
the file to be accessed via workspace browsers, or accidentally archived,
disclosing the token.

SECURITY-1429 / CVE-2019-10366
Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job config.xml
files on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass through type casts in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1465 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10355**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented by casting crafted objects to other types.
This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to invoke constructors that weren’t approved.

Additionally, this could be used to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins controller.

Casting collections to other types as an alternative syntax for constructor invocation is now only allowed when the collection type is defined in `java.util`, and prohibited otherwise.
Casting files and enums to arrays is now intercepted by the sandbox and treated as the invocation of an equivalent method.

### Sandbox bypass through method pointer expressions in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1465 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10356**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through crafted subexpressions used as arguments to method pointer expressions.
This allowed attackers able to specify sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

Method pointer subexpressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Missing permission check in Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin

**SECURITY-1422
/
CVE-2019-10357**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-cps-global-lib`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-cps-global-lib)**

**Description:**

Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin provides form validation to determine whether the revision (e.g. commit, tag, or branch name) specified for a global library exists in the repository.
This form validation method lacked a permission check, allowing attackers with Overall/Read access to determine whether an attacker-specified revision exists in an SCM repository configured for use in an existing shared library.

Pipeline: Deprecated Groovy Libraries Plugin now performs the appropriate permission check.

### Maven Integration Plugin did not mask sensitive values in module build logs

**SECURITY-713
/
CVE-2019-10358**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`maven-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/maven-plugin)**

**Description:**

Maven Integration Plugin did not apply build log decorators from the Build Environment configuration to module builds.
This could prevent sensitive content in module build logs from being masked.

Maven Integration Plugin now applies build log decorators from the Build Environment configuration to module builds.

### CSRF vulnerability in Maven Release Plug-in Plugin

**SECURITY-1098
/
CVE-2019-10359**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to initiate the release process use POST.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to perform releases.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin now requires that these requests be sent via POST.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in Maven Release Plug-in Plugin

**SECURITY-1184
/
CVE-2019-10360**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin did not properly escape variables in multiple views, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Variables on affected views are now escaped.

### Maven Release Plug-in Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1435
/
CVE-2019-10361**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`m2release`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/m2release)**

**Description:**

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `org.jvnet.hudson.plugins.m2release.M2ReleaseBuildWrapper.xml` on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Maven Release Plug-in Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

### Configuration as Code Plugin failed to mask secrets in system log messages

**SECURITY-1279
/
CVE-2019-10343**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin logs the changes it applies to the Jenkins system log.
Secrets such as passwords should be masked (i.e. replaced with asterisks) in that log to prevent accidental disclosure.

Between Configuration as Code Plugin 0.8-alpha and 1.0, log messages contained values if the values were specified using properties in the YAML file ([SECURITY-929](/security/advisory/2018-06-25/#SECURITY-929)).

Since Configuration as Code Plugin 1.1, log messages in Configuration as Code Plugin instead mask values of type `Secret`, which is used in Jenkins to store the values encrypted on disk.
This did not work in many instances, as plugins could use the [`Secret`](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/byShortName/Secret "Javadoc for Secret") type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the `Secret` type appear in their Java API.

Configuration as Code Plugin now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of log message masking.

As a workaround, administrators can configure the logging level of the logger `io.jenkins.plugins.casc.Attribute` to a level that does not include `INFO` messages.
See [the logging documentation](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Logging) for details.

### Configuration as Code Plugin allowed users without Overall/Administer permission to access documentation

**SECURITY-1290
/
CVE-2019-10344**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin provides a generated schema and reference documentation for the configuration options supported on the current Jenkins instance.
These URLs did not perform additional permission checks, resulting in their content being available to users with Overall/Read access.
This included detailed information about installed plugins that may not be available otherwise.

Access to these URLs is now restricted to users with Overall/Administer permission.

### Configuration as Code Plugin did not mask proxy credentials

**SECURITY-1303
/
CVE-2019-10345**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin provides a custom configurator for the Jenkins proxy configuration.

This feature did not mask the password for logging or encrypt it in the export.

Configuration as Code Plugin 1.20 and newer mask the Jenkins proxy password when logged and only store it encrypted in the export.

### Configuration as Code Plugin evaluated variable references when importing a previously exported configuration

**SECURITY-1446
/
CVE-2019-10362**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin allows exporting the live Jenkins configuration, as well as importing and applying a configuration provided in the same format.
One of the features of the import is that it allows specifying variable references (e.g. `${VARIABLE_NAME}`) in the configuration YAML file.
These will be replaced by the value of the corresponding environment variable (or [other source of secrets](https://github.com/jenkinsci/configuration-as-code-plugin/#handling-secrets)) during import (interpolation).
If such a value should not be interpolated, the escape character `^` can be used before (e.g. `^${VARIABLE_NAME}`).

Exporting did not add `^` escape characters to exported strings, such as various entity descriptions.
This allowed attackers with permission to configure certain entities, such as credentials or agents, to specify crafted descriptions containing variable references.
These would be replaced by the corresponding environment variable’s value during a subsequent import.

The export now adds `^` escape characters to exported strings as needed to prevent them from being interpolated during import.
Previously exported configurations may require manual cleanup by Jenkins admins before being imported.

### Configuration as Code Plugin exported secret values in plain text

**SECURITY-1458
/
CVE-2019-10363**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`configuration-as-code`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code)**

**Description:**

Configuration as Code Plugin allows to export the current Jenkins configuration as a YAML file.
Secrets such as passwords should be exported in their encrypted form to prevent accidental disclosure.

Configuration as Code Plugin did not reliably detect which values in the exported YAML file need to be considered sensitive (e.g. credentials and other secrets), as plugins could use the [`Secret`](https://javadoc.jenkins.io/byShortName/Secret "Javadoc for Secret") type to store credentials encrypted on disk while not having the `Secret` type appear in their Java API.
This resulted in credentials being exported in plain text in some cases.

Configuration as Code Plugin now inspects the type and looks for a field, getter, or constructor argument corresponding to the property, making the secret detection much more robust for the purpose of exporting encrypted secrets.

### Amazon EC2 Plugin leaked beginning of private key in system log

**SECURITY-673
/
CVE-2019-10364**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ec2`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ec2)**

**Description:**

Amazon EC2 Plugin printed a log message that contained the beginning of the private key to the Jenkins system log.

The log message no longer includes the beginning of the private key.

### Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin stored temporary secret in a user accessible location

**SECURITY-1345
/
CVE-2019-10365**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`google-kubernetes-engine`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/google-kubernetes-engine)**

**Description:**

Google Kubernetes Engine Plugin created a temporary file named `.kubeâ¦config` containing a temporary access token in the project workspace.
This allowed the file to be accessed via workspace browsers, or accidentally archived, disclosing the token.

This temporary file is now created outside the regular project workspace.

### Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1429
/
CVE-2019-10366**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`skytap`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/skytap)**

**Description:**

Skytap Cloud CI Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Skytap Cloud CI Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |
| --- | --- |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)
