Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10760:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `safer-eval` package not properly sanitizing or restricting the use of `constructor` properties within the evaluated code. This allows specially crafted payloads to escape the intended sandbox environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary code by exploiting the way `safer-eval` handles `constructor` properties.
- **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to break out of the intended sandbox environment provided by `safer-eval`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation can lead to a total loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, meaning an attacker can:
   - Access all resources
   - Modify any/all files
   - Deny access to resources/system
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system, essentially taking control of it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network, as indicated by the Attack Vector (AV) being 'Network'. This implies the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires minimal privileges, essentially user-level access, as stated by the Privileges Required (PR) being 'Low'.
- **No User Interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction.
- **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is relatively easy to execute, with an Attack Complexity (AC) of 'Low', which means no special conditions are required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Package:** The vulnerability exists in the `safer-eval` package, specifically in versions prior to 1.3.2.
- **CVSS Score:** Both Snyk and NVD assigned a critical CVSS score of 9.9.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection').

In summary, CVE-2019-10760 represents a critical vulnerability in the `safer-eval` package, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code due to the improper handling of constructor properties, which can lead to total loss of Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
