## Descriptions

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check allowed changing default graph configuration in analysis-core Plugin

**SECURITY-1100
/
CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`analysis-core`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/analysis-core)**

**Description:**

analysis-core Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to display trend graphs for their static analysis results.
analysis-core Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

analysis-core Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

### SiteMonitor Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-930
/
CVE-2019-10317**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`sitemonitor`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/sitemonitor)**

**Description:**

SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that.
Instead, it now has an opt-in option to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

### XXE vulnerability via UDP broadcast response in Swarm Plugin client

**SECURITY-1252
/
CVE-2019-10309**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`swarm`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/swarm)**

**Description:**

Swarm Plugin allows clients to auto-discover Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Swarm Plugin does not configure the XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.
This allows unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Ansible Tower Plugin allowed capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1355 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible-tower`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower)**

**Description:**

Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method implementing form validation.
This allowed users with Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer permissions.

### Users with Overall/Read access are able to enumerate credential IDs in Ansible Tower Plugin

**SECURITY-1355 (2)
/
CVE-2019-10312**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ansible-tower`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ansible-tower)**

**Description:**

Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs.
Those could be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires Overall/Administer permission.

### Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1390
/
CVE-2019-10318**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`azure-ad`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/azure-ad)**

**Description:**

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global `config.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Microsoft Entra ID (previously Azure AD) Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

### Twitter Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1143
/
CVE-2019-10313**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`twitter`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/twitter)**

**Description:**

Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### Koji Plugin globally and unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation

**SECURITY-936
/
CVE-2019-10314**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`koji`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/koji)**

**Description:**

Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the entire Jenkins controller JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### CSRF vulnerability in OAuth callback in GitHub Authentication Plugin

**SECURITY-443
/
CVE-2019-10315**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`github-oauth`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/github-oauth)**

**Description:**

GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to prevent CSRF.
This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim.
If the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be attached to the attacker’s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

### Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1380
/
CVE-2019-10316**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`aqua-microscanner`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/aqua-microscanner)**

**Description:**

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin stored credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

Aqua MicroScanner Plugin now stores credentials encrypted.

SECURITY-1100 / CVE-2019-10307 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10308 (permission check)
Static Analysis Utilities Plugin has the capability to allow other plugins to
display trend graphs for their static analysis results. Static Analysis
Utilities Plugin provides the configuration form for the default settings of
each graph.

The configuration form and form submission handler did not perform a
permission check, allowing attackers with Job/Read access to change the
per-job graph configuration defaults for all users.

Additionally, the form submission handler did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

Static Analysis Utilities Plugin now requires Job/Configure permission and
POST requests to configure the per-job graph defaults for all users.

SECURITY-930 / CVE-2019-10317
SiteMonitor Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for
the entire Jenkins master JVM.

SiteMonitor Plugin no longer does that. Instead, it now has an opt-in option
to ignore SSL/TLS errors for each site check individually.

SECURITY-1252 / CVE-2019-10309
Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin allows clients to auto-discover
Jenkins instances on the same network through a UDP discovery request.
Responses to this request are XML documents.

Self-Organizing Swarm Plug-in Modules Plugin does not configure the XML parser
in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing. This allows
unauthenticated attackers on the same network to have Swarm clients parse a
maliciously crafted XML response that uses external entities to read arbitrary
files from the Swarm client or denial-of-service attacks.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1355 (1) / CVE-2019-10310 (CSRF) and CVE-2019-10311 (permission check)
Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allowed users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials stored
in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

This form validation method now requires POST requests and Overall/Administer
permissions.

SECURITY-1355 (2) / CVE-2019-10312
Ansible Tower Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality did not check permissions, allowing any user with
Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those could be
used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

An enumeration of credentials IDs in this plugin now requires
Overall/Administer permission.

SECURITY-1390 / CVE-2019-10318
Azure AD Plugin stored the client secret unencrypted in the global config.xml
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by
users with access to the master file system.

Azure AD Plugin now stores the client secret encrypted.

SECURITY-1143 / CVE-2019-10313
Twitter Plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file
on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with access
to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-936 / CVE-2019-10314
Koji Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for the
entire Jenkins master JVM.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-443 / CVE-2019-10315
GitHub Authentication Plugin did not manage the state parameter of OAuth to
prevent CSRF. This allowed an attacker to catch the redirect URL provided
during the authentication process using OAuth and send it to the victim. If
the victim was already connected to Jenkins, their Jenkins account would be
attached to the attacker’s GitHub account.

The state parameter is now correctly managed.

SECURITY-1380 / CVE-2019-10316
