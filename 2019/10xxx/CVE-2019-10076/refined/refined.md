Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10076:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of attachment filenames during upload, allowing for the injection of malicious code into the filename.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS): Malicious code embedded in an attachment filename is executed when the filename is displayed within the JSPWiki application.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Session hijacking: Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, granting the attacker unauthorized access to user accounts and their associated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious attachment: The primary attack vector involves uploading a specially crafted file with a malicious filename.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload attachments to the JSPWiki application. This typically requires user privileges on the system (e.g., a registered user).

**Technical details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the application displays the uploaded attachment filename, which was not sanitized.
- The vulnerable code is located within the Apache JSPWiki application when handling attachment uploads and rendering attachment lists or related UI elements.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 2.11.0.M4 or later to sanitize the input.
