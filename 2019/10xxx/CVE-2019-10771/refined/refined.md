Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper handling of characters in the GET URL path by `iobroker.web` versions before 2.4.10. Specifically, these characters are not properly escaped before being reflected in the server response.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79). The lack of proper output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is then executed by the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Stealing cookies and hijacking user sessions.
    - Exposing sensitive information.
    - Enabling access to privileged services and functionality.
    - Delivering malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious URL with unescaped characters in the path, which are then reflected in the server's response.
- This is a reflected XSS vulnerability. An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link that includes the attack payload, causing the payload to be sent to the vulnerable server which reflects the malicious code to the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a URL that is sent to a user. The attacker needs to trick a user to click the link, for example via social engineering.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication or access to the vulnerable system.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content includes a detailed explanation of XSS attacks, including different types (stored, reflected, DOM-based, mutated), affected environments, and prevention methods.
- The Snyk vulnerability report also includes CVSS v3.1 scores, threat intelligence (EPSS), and links to the relevant GitHub commit that introduced the fix.
