CVE-2019-10779: Cross-site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in stroom:stroom-app

- Root cause of vulnerability: The application is vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can load the Stroom UI into a hidden iframe and issue commands to the Stroom UI, gaining full control on behalf of the logged-in user. This occurs because the application doesn't properly validate or escape user input before reflecting it back to the user.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can take full control of the Stroom UI on behalf of a logged-in user. This can lead to stealing cookies, hijacking user sessions, exposing sensitive information, enabling access to privileged services and functionality, and delivering malware.
- Attack vectors: An attacker website loads the Stroom UI into a hidden iframe. The attacker site then issues commands to the Stroom UI.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to host a malicious website that can load the vulnerable Stroom UI in an iframe and interact with it. The attacker requires a user to visit the attacker's website while being logged into the Stroom application.
