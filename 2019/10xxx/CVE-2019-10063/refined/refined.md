    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-10063",
    "description": "flatpak: Sandbox bypass via IOCSTI (incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5226)",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "An incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5226 in flatpak allowed a sandbox bypass. The initial fix used a seccomp filter to prevent sandboxed apps from using the TIOCSTI ioctl. However, on 64-bit platforms, this filter could be bypassed using an ioctl request number with TIOCSTI in the 32 least significant bits and an arbitrary nonzero value in its 32 most significant bits.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incomplete seccomp filter implementation for the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems.",
         "Improper handling of 64-bit ioctl request numbers where the kernel only uses the lower 32 bits."
       ],
      "impact": "A malicious flatpak application could inject commands into the controlled terminal of the host after the flatpak application exits, leading to data confidentiality and integrity issues, as well as system availability issues. If the application is run as root on the host, code could be executed as root on the host system.",
      "attack_vector": "A malicious flatpak application executing within the sandbox.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to create and distribute a malicious flatpak application and convince a user to download and run it. The attacker needs to include exploit code to utilize the incorrect handling of the TIOCSTI ioctl.",
      "affected_components": [
        "flatpak versions before 1.0.8",
        "1.1.x and 1.2.x before 1.2.4",
