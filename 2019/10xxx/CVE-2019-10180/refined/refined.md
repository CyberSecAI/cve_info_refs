Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-10180:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Token Processing Service (TPS) in Dogtag PKI did not properly sanitize several parameters stored for tokens. Specifically, user IDs and policy fields were not being sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of sanitization of user-controlled input (token parameters) allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the database. This code is then executed in the browsers of other users when they view the affected data in the UI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser.
- **Potential for Defacement:** Although the impact is described as limited, one consequence is that the attacker could deface the web UI.
- **Other potential malicious actions:** Although not explicitly mentioned, this could also include other malicious actions like stealing session cookies, redirecting the user, or performing actions on behalf of the user, if they are not protected by client-side TLS authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker modifies the token parameters (user ID, policy, etc.) through the application's interface or potentially through direct database manipulation (if access is available).
- The XSS payload is stored in the database.
- When a victim (an authenticated user) views the token information in the TPS web UI, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Modify Token Parameters:** The attacker needs the privilege to modify the token parameters within the TPS.
- **Access to the TPS UI:** The attacker needs access to the web interface to modify parameters.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to make the changes.
- **Victim Interaction:** The attacker needs an authenticated victim to navigate to the vulnerable URL in order for the XSS payload to be executed.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed with input validation and output escaping:
    - The `TPSProfileService` was modified to validate the profile ID and profile property names received via the REST API.
    - The TPS UI was modified to validate the profile ID and property names before sending them to the server.
    - The `TableItem.renderColumn()` method was modified to escape the value already stored in the database before displaying it in the UI.
- The fix was implemented in commit `1dbb07f8e41b4809b0f41a7643c37301fcf712d8`.
- The severity of the issue was initially classified as medium, but later reduced to low due to the need for high privileges to modify token policies.
- The issue was addressed in Red Hat Certificate System 9.7 and 9.4 EUS via RHSA-2021:0947 and RHSA-2021:0948 respectively.
