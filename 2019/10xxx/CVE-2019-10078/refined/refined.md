Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10078:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability stemming from a lack of proper input sanitization within Apache JSPWiki plugins. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered through crafted plugin link invocations. While initially identified in `ReferredPagesPlugin`, further analysis revealed that multiple plugins were affected by the same flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of an XSS vulnerability, indicating insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input when creating plugin links. This allows for malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to session hijacking. This means that a malicious actor could potentially gain control of a user's active session and perform actions on their behalf.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves the use of a carefully crafted plugin link invocation, which could be embedded within a wiki page. By crafting a malicious plugin link, an attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to be able to create or modify content within the JSPWiki instance. This would require at least the privileges to edit pages. The attacker must be able to craft a malicious link that would execute JavaScript when rendered.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects Apache JSPWiki versions up to 2.11.0.M3.
- The issue was discovered by RunningSnail.
- The recommended mitigation is to upgrade to Apache JSPWiki 2.11.0.M4 or later.
- The provided content also mentions that multiple plugins were found to be vulnerable beyond the originally reported `ReferredPagesPlugin`.
