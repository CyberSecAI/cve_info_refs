Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10721:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the `ReturnUrl` parameter within the BlogEngine.NET application. Specifically, the application checks if the `ReturnUrl` starts with a forward slash (`/`) but does not perform sufficient checks to prevent redirection to external sites. This check is performed in the `BlogEngine/BlogEngine.Core/Services/Security/Security.cs` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unvalidated Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an unvalidated redirect. By manipulating the `ReturnUrl` parameter, an attacker can force a user to be redirected to an arbitrary external website after a successful login. This allows an attacker to perform phishing attacks or potentially deliver malware.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** The most direct impact is that attackers can redirect users to a fake login page designed to steal credentials. Users who believe they are logging into the legitimate BlogEngine.NET application would instead be providing their information to the attacker.
*   **Malware Delivery:** The attacker could redirect users to a page that downloads malware or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser.
*   **Loss of user trust:** Users being redirected to unexpected sites could severely damage trust in the website

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a specially crafted URL that includes a malicious `ReturnUrl` parameter. The user is required to log in first.
*   An attacker could distribute the malicious URL via email, social media, or other channels.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create and distribute a link to the vulnerable application's login page with a crafted `ReturnUrl` parameter.
*   The attacker does not need any special access or privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   The attacker is in a remote network position.
*   User interaction is required for exploitation

**Technical details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `login.aspx` and `register.aspx` pages.
*   The vulnerable code is located in `BlogEngine/BlogEngine.Core/Services/Security/Security.cs`.
*   The application's logic incorrectly considers URLs beginning with `//` to be local.
*   The application was patched in version 3.3.8.0 by restricting the `ReturnUrl` to local pages.

**Additional Notes:**
*  The provided content indicates that the vulnerability has a "Moderate" severity rating with a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1, indicating potential for exploitation, but with some restrictions.
*  The related CWE is CWE-601 which is "URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect')"
*  The EPSS score is 0.122%, meaning it has a low probability of being exploited.
