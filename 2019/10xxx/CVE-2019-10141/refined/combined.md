## Environment considerations

Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with versions 6.1 and 5.7 introduced a new Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM) service. Red Hat Network (RHN) has been decommissioned.

Users that are new to Red Hat or would like the enhanced subscription information and improved content access should use RHSM. If you are still using Red Hat Network, we advise you to [migrate to RHSM as soon as possible](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-subscription-management#migration). Customers using older versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux must continue using RHN Classic. Refer to [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](https://access.redhat.com/articles/47844) and [What's the difference between management services provided by Red Hat Network (RHN) Classic and Red Hat Subscription Management (RHSM)?](https://access.redhat.com/articles/63269) for more information on benefits of RHSM over RHN.

* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9](#rhel9).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8](#rhel8).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7**, register the system using RHSM as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7](#rhel7).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 6.1 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). Then update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6](#rhel6).
* For **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5**, register the system using RHSM (if RHEL 5.7 or above) as described in [Registering the system with the Subscription Manager](#rhsm). After registration, update the system according to instructions in [Applying package updates on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5](#rhel5).
* If your system cannot connect to the Internet directly, our [Red Hat Satellite](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-satellite/) offering may be of interest.

## Prerequisites

### Registering the system with the Subscription Manager

#### Graphical interface

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 via **Activities** and then **Show Applications** which is visible in the Favorites dock by default.

Access the Subscription Management GUI client in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 via **Activities**, then select **Show Applications** and click **All**. Then select **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 open **Applications** -> **System Tools** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager** and in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 via **System** -> **Administration** -> **Red Hat Subscription Manager**.

#### Command line

A system can also be registered via the command line by using the "subscription-manager" command. To register your system, either through the GUI or from the command line, follow the instructions in the [Using and Configuring Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Subscription_Management/1/html-single/RHSM/index.html) guide.

Make sure that your firewall allows configuring RHSM, for more information see [How do I access RHSM (yum) through a firewall?](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/65300).

General information on RHSM can be found in [Red Hat Network Subscription Management](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Customer_Portal/1/html/Red_Hat_Network_Certificate-based_Subscription_Management/index.html), while [FAQ for Changes to Red Hat's Entitlement Platform with RHEL 6.1 and 5.7](/knowledge/node/47844) provides a quick overview and a comparison with RHN.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c0)  Summer Long    2019-05-19 23:24:47 UTC  ``` There is an SQL-injection vulnerability in the inpector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes an SQL query using unescaped data received on the wire from a server reporting inspection results (specifically, via a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint).  The unescaped data should not be trusted - the API is unauthenticated and it's likely that anything with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening could exploit the vulnerability.  Because of how the results of the query are used, there appears to be no way to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data. It could be exploited for destructive ends by passing malicious data (e.g. "\'; DROP DATABASE;\'").  Every release from RHOS 8 on is affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c1)  Summer Long    2019-05-19 23:31:17 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Zane Bitter (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c7)  Summer Long    2019-05-21 00:31:57 UTC  ``` Created openstack-ironic-inspector tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1712186](show_bug.cgi?id=1712186 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-10141 openstack-ironic-inspector: SQL Injection vulnerability when receiving introspection data [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c8)  Summer Long    2019-05-21 00:49:44 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://review.opendev.org/660234>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c10)  Summer Long    2019-05-26 23:17:54 UTC  ``` Upstream patches: queens 7.2.4 -<https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660306/1>,  rocky 8.0.3 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660305/1> ocata 5.0.2 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660310/1> pike 6.0.3 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660308/1> stein 8.2.1 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660304/1>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c11)  Summer Long    2019-05-26 23:17:56 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/stein.html#relnotes-8-2-1-stable-stein> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/rocky.html#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/queens.html#relnotes-7-2-4-stable-queens> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/pike.html#relnotes-6-0-3-4-stable-pike> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/ocata.html#relnotes-5-0-2-7-origin-stable-ocata>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-02 19:45:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14.0 (Rocky)  Via RHSA-2019:1669 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1669](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1669)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-10 09:18:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2019:1722 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1722](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1722)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-10 13:02:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2019:1734 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1734](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1734)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:07:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

  from the introspection data. It could potentially allow SQL injections
  via the `/v1/continue` API endpoint. See [story 2005678](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005678) for details.

## 8.2.0[Â¶](#relnotes-8-2-0-stable-stein "Link to this heading")

### Prelude[Â¶](#prelude "Link to this heading")

The Stein release of ironic-inspector features support of storing introspection data in the database instead of the Object Store service, as well as fixes for IPv6.

### New Features[Â¶](#new-features "Link to this heading")

* Adds the support to store introspection data in ironic-inspector database.
  Set the option `[processing]store_data` to `database` to use this
  feature.

* Adds a migration tool `ironic-inspector-migrate-data` to facilitate the
  introspection data migration between supported introspection data storage
  backends. Currently the available introspection data storage backends are:
  `database` and `swift`. For example, to migrate existing introspection
  data stored in the swift to database, execute following command:

  ```
  $ ironic-inspector-migrate-data --from swift --to database --config-file /etc/ironic-inspector/inspector.conf

  ```

  Storage backends involved in the migration should have been properly
  configured in the ironic inspector configuration file. Before the
  introspection data migration can be started. The ironic inspector database
  should be upgraded to have the latest schema.

* Adds support to use `latest` as the microversion value in the request
  to the ironic-inspector API.

### Upgrade Notes[Â¶](#upgrade-notes "Link to this heading")

* The `set-attribute` action now automatically sets `reset_interfaces` to
  `True` if the driver is updated. If itâs not desired, set it explicitly
  to `False`.

### Deprecation Notes[Â¶](#deprecation-notes "Link to this heading")

* Deprecates the configuration option `[processing]store_data_location`.
  The introspection data can be retrieved from the ironic-inspector API,
  there is no need to keep an extra link in ironic.

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-8-2-0-stable-stein-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixes inspection of nodes with IPv6 BMC address. Inspection could not be
  initiated because an IPv6 address was treated as a hostname, which could
  not be resolved.

* Remove debug logging for PXE filter driver which tends to fill up inspector logs when debug is enabled.

* Fixes updating a driver with the `set-attribute` introspection rule
  action by providing `reset_interfaces`.

# Queens Series (6.1.0 - 7.2.x) Release Notes

# Queens Series (6.1.0 - 7.2.x) Release Notes[Â¶](#queens-series-6-1-0-7-2-x-release-notes "Link to this heading")

## 7.2.4[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-4-stable-queens "Link to this heading")

### Security Issues[Â¶](#security-issues "Link to this heading")

* Fixes insufficient input filtering when looking up a node by information
  from the introspection data. It could potentially allow SQL injections
  via the `/v1/continue` API endpoint. See [story 2005678](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005678) for details.

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fix starting inspection of node having IPv6 BMC address.
  Inspection could not be initiated because v6 address
  was being considered as a hostname. Thus resolving incorrect
  hostname ended up with blocking error.

## 7.2.3[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-3-stable-queens "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-3-stable-queens-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Allows the `set-attribute` introspection rule action to accept `None`
  as value for a property.

## 7.2.2[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-2-stable-queens "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-2-stable-queens-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* A new rootwrap filter is now included to allow control of the systemd
  dnsmasq service used by ironic-inspector. This fixes a permission issue
  when systemctl commands are used as `dnsmasq_start_command` and
  `dnsmasq_stop_command` in the configuration for the dnsmasq pxe filter.
  See bug [2002818](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002818).

  Note

  The filter uses the systemd service name used by the RDO
  distrubution (`openstack-ironic-inspector-dnsmasq.service`).

* Fixes issue that can result in introspection failure when a network switch sends incomplete information for LLDP switch\_id or port\_id. The validation expects these fields when a port is updated, this fix now handles the validation exception.

* The `dnsmasq` PXE filter no longer whitelists the MAC addresses of ports
  deleted from the Bare Metal service. Instead they are blacklisted unless
  introspection is active or the `node_not_found_hook` is set in the
  configuration. This ensures that no previously enrolled node accidentally
  boot the inspection image when no node introspection is active.
  [Bug #2001979](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001979).

## 7.2.1[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-1-stable-queens "Link to this heading")

### New Features[Â¶](#new-features "Link to this heading")

* Adds wildcard ignore entry to `dnsmasq` PXE filter. When node
  introspection is active, or if `node_not_found_hook` is set in the
  configuration the ignore is removed from the wildcard entry. This ensures
  that unknown nodes do not accidentally boot into the introspection image
  when no node introspection is active.

  This brings `dnsmasq` PXE filter driver feature parity with the
  `iptables` PXE filter driver, which uses a firewall rule to block any
  DHCP request on the interface where Ironic Inspectorâs DHCP server is
  listening.

## 7.2.0[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-0-stable-queens "Link to this heading")

### Upgrade Notes[Â¶](#upgrade-notes "Link to this heading")

* Adds dependency on the [retrying](https://github.com/rholder/retrying)
  python library.

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-7-2-0-stable-queens-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixes bug in which the `switch_id` field in a portâs `local_link_connection` can be set to
  a non-MAC address if the processed LLDP has a value other than a
  MAC address for `ChassisID`. The bare metal API requires the `switch_id`
  field to be a MAC address, and will return an error otherwise.
  See [bug 1748022](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1748022)
  for details.

* Ironic introspection no longer tries to access the Identity service if the
  `auth_strategy` option is set to `noauth` and the `auth_type` option
  is not set to `none`.

* The periodic PXE filter update task now retries fetching port list from
  the Bare Metal service 5 times (with 1 second delay) before giving up.
  This ensures that a temporary networking glitch will not result in
  the ironic-inspector service stopping.

## 7.1.0[Â¶](#relnotes-7-1-0-stable-queens "Link to this heading")

### Deprecation Notes[Â¶](#deprecation-notes "Link to this heading")

* Several configuration options related to ironic API access
  are deprecated and will be removed in the Rocky release.
  These include:

  + `[ironic]/os_region` - use `[ironic]/region_name` option instead
  + `[ironic]/auth_strategy` - set `[ironic]/auth_type` option to
    `none` to access ironic API in noauth mode
  + `[ironic]/ironic_url` - use `[ironic]/endpoint_override` option
    to set specific ironic API endpoint address if discovery of ironic API
    endpoint is not desired or impossible (for example in standalone mode)
  + `[ironic]/os_service_type` - use `[ironic]/service_type` option
  + `[ironic]/os_endpoint_type` - use `[ironic]/valid_interfaces`
    option to set ironic endpoint types that will be attempted to be used

* Several configuration options related to swift API access are deprecated
  and will be removed in Rocky release.
  These include:

  + `[swift]/os_service_type` - use `[swift]/service_type` option
  + `[swift]/os_endpoint_type` - use `[swift]/valid_interfaces` option
  + `[swift]/os_region` - use `[swift]region_name` option

### Other Notes[Â¶](#other-notes "Link to this heading")

* The sample configuration file located at `example.conf`
  and the sample policy file located at `policy.yaml.sample`
  were removed in this release, as they are now published with documentation.
  See [the sample configuration file](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest/configuration/sample-config.html)
  and [the sample policy file](https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest/configuration/sample-policy.html).

# Rocky Series (8.0.0 - 8.0.x) Release Notes

# Rocky Series (8.0.0 - 8.0.x) Release Notes[Â¶](#rocky-series-8-0-0-8-0-x-release-notes "Link to this heading")

## 8.0.4[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-4-stable-rocky "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixes an issue while mapping port InfiniBand MAC
  address to EthernetOverInfiniBand MAC. Prior to this fix,
  it will fail to map and raise an exception.

## 8.0.3[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky "Link to this heading")

### Security Issues[Â¶](#security-issues "Link to this heading")

* Fixes insufficient input filtering when looking up a node by information
  from the introspection data. It could potentially allow SQL injections
  via the `/v1/continue` API endpoint. See [story 2005678](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005678) for details.

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fix starting inspection of node having IPv6 BMC address.
  Inspection could not be initiated because v6 address
  was being considered as a hostname. Thus resolving incorrect
  hostname ended up with blocking error.

## 8.0.2[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-2-stable-rocky "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-2-stable-rocky-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Allows the `set-attribute` introspection rule action to accept `None`
  as value for a property.

## 8.0.1[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-1-stable-rocky "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-1-stable-rocky-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* A new rootwrap filter is now included to allow control of the systemd
  dnsmasq service used by ironic-inspector. This fixes a permission issue
  when systemctl commands are used as `dnsmasq_start_command` and
  `dnsmasq_stop_command` in the configuration for the dnsmasq pxe filter.
  See bug [2002818](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002818).

  Note

  The filter uses the systemd service name used by the RDO
  distrubution (`openstack-ironic-inspector-dnsmasq.service`).

* Fixes issue that can result in introspection failure when a network switch sends incomplete information for LLDP switch\_id or port\_id. The validation expects these fields when a port is updated, this fix now handles the validation exception.

## 8.0.0[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-0-stable-rocky "Link to this heading")

### New Features[Â¶](#new-features "Link to this heading")

* Adds new parameter `manage_boot` to the introspection API to allow
  disabling boot management (setting the boot device and rebooting)
  for a specific node. If it is set to `False`, the boot is supposed
  to be managed by a 3rd party.

  If the new option `can_manage_boot` is set to `False` (the default is
  `True), then ``manage_boot` must be explicitly set to `False`.

* Modifies introspection rules to allow formatting to be applied to strings nested in dicts and lists in the actions.

### Upgrade Notes[Â¶](#upgrade-notes "Link to this heading")

* Updates the default Ironic API version to 1.38.

  This version is used by default within the Bare Metal Inspection service
  when communicating with the Bare Metal API. It is the default used by
  processing plugins, which may override the version, and by introspection
  rules, which may not override the version.

  1.38 was the API version at the time of the most recent Queens series
  Bare Metal service release (10.1.0).

  See [story 2002166](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002166).

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-8-0-0-stable-rocky-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* The `dnsmasq` PXE filter no longer whitelists the MAC addresses of ports
  deleted from the Bare Metal service. Instead they are blacklisted unless
  introspection is active or the `node_not_found_hook` is set in the
  configuration. This ensures that no previously enrolled node accidentally
  boot the inspection image when no node introspection is active.
  [Bug #2001979](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2001979).

* Stops introspection when setting boot device is failed, as the node is
  not guarenteed to perform a PXE boot in this case.

### Other Notes[Â¶](#other-notes "Link to this heading")

* The deprecated configuration option `[iptables]manage_firewall` was
  removed, use `[pxe_filter]driver` to set filtering driver.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c0)  Summer Long    2019-05-19 23:24:47 UTC  ``` There is an SQL-injection vulnerability in the inpector's node_cache.find_node(). This function makes an SQL query using unescaped data received on the wire from a server reporting inspection results (specifically, via a POST to the /v1/continue endpoint).  The unescaped data should not be trusted - the API is unauthenticated and it's likely that anything with access to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening could exploit the vulnerability.  Because of how the results of the query are used, there appears to be no way to exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data. It could be exploited for destructive ends by passing malicious data (e.g. "\'; DROP DATABASE;\'").  Every release from RHOS 8 on is affected.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c1)  Summer Long    2019-05-19 23:31:17 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Zane Bitter (Red Hat)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c7)  Summer Long    2019-05-21 00:31:57 UTC  ``` Created openstack-ironic-inspector tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: openstack-rdo [[bug 1712186](show_bug.cgi?id=1712186 "CLOSED CURRENTRELEASE - CVE-2019-10141 openstack-ironic-inspector: SQL Injection vulnerability when receiving introspection data [openstack-rdo]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c8)  Summer Long    2019-05-21 00:49:44 UTC  ``` Upstream patch: <https://review.opendev.org/660234>   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c10)  Summer Long    2019-05-26 23:17:54 UTC  ``` Upstream patches: queens 7.2.4 -<https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660306/1>,  rocky 8.0.3 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660305/1> ocata 5.0.2 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660310/1> pike 6.0.3 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660308/1> stein 8.2.1 - <https://review.opendev.org/#/c/660304/1>   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c11)  Summer Long    2019-05-26 23:17:56 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/stein.html#relnotes-8-2-1-stable-stein> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/rocky.html#relnotes-8-0-3-stable-rocky> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/queens.html#relnotes-7-2-4-stable-queens> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/pike.html#relnotes-6-0-3-4-stable-pike> <https://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/ironic-inspector/ocata.html#relnotes-5-0-2-7-origin-stable-ocata>   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-02 19:45:18 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 14.0 (Rocky)  Via RHSA-2019:1669 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1669](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1669)   ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c15)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-10 09:18:12 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 10.0 (Newton)  Via RHSA-2019:1722 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1722](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1722)   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c16)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-07-10 13:02:24 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13.0 (Queens)  Via RHSA-2019:1734 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:1734](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A1734)   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1711722#c17)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-07-12 13:07:11 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Pike Series (6.0.0 - 6.0.x) Release Notes

# Pike Series (6.0.0 - 6.0.x) Release Notes[Â¶](#pike-series-6-0-0-6-0-x-release-notes "Link to this heading")

## 6.0.3-5[Â¶](#relnotes-6-0-3-5-stable-pike "Link to this heading")

### Security Issues[Â¶](#security-issues "Link to this heading")

* Fixes insufficient input filtering when looking up a node by information
  from the introspection data. It could potentially allow SQL injections
  via the `/v1/continue` API endpoint. See [story 2005678](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005678) for details.

## 6.0.2[Â¶](#relnotes-6-0-2-stable-pike "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Fixes bug in which the `switch_id` field in a portâs `local_link_connection` can be set to
  a non-MAC address if the processed LLDP has a value other than a
  MAC address for `ChassisID`. The bare metal API requires the `switch_id`
  field to be a MAC address, and will return an error otherwise.
  See [bug 1748022](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1748022)
  for details.

## 6.0.1[Â¶](#relnotes-6-0-1-stable-pike "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-6-0-1-stable-pike-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* The older `ipmi_address` field in the introspection data no longer has
  priority over the newer `bmc_address` inventory field during lookup.
  This fixes lookup based on MAC addresses, when the BMC address is reported
  as `0.0.0.0` for any reason (see [bug 1714944](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/%2Bbug/1714944)).

## 6.0.0[Â¶](#relnotes-6-0-0-stable-pike "Link to this heading")

### New Features[Â¶](#new-features "Link to this heading")

* Querying **ironic-inspector** rules API now also returns the `invert` and
  `multiple` attributes of the associated conditions.

* Add `disabled` option to `add_ports`, so discovered nodes can be
  created without creating ports.

* Add a check from the `link_local_connection` plugin to use data stored by
  the `lldp_basic`; this avoids parsing the LLDP packets twice.

* Adds node state to the `GET /v1/introspection/<node UUID or name>` and `GET /v1/introspection` API response data.

* Processing hooks can now define dependencies on other processing hooks.
  **ironic-inspector** start up fails when required hooks are not enabled
  before the hook that requires them.

* Update `pxe_enabled` field on ports. It is set to `True` for the
  PXE-booting port and `False` for the remaining ports. Both newly
  discovered and existing ports are affected.

### Upgrade Notes[Â¶](#upgrade-notes "Link to this heading")

* Experimental setting IPMI credentials support was removed from all versions
  of the API. The current **ironic-inspector** API version was bumped to
  1.12 to mark this change.

* The default API version was synchronized with the current API version again
  after removal of the IPMI credentials setting.

* Ports creating logic was moved from core processing code to the
  `validate_interfaces` processing hook. This may affect deployments
  that disable this hook or replace it with something else. Also make
  sure to place this hook before any hooks expecting ports to be created.

* Bare metal API version 1.19 is now required.

* Removes deprecated configuration options: `introspection_delay_drivers` from the
  default section and `log_bmc_address` from the `processing` section.

* Support for rollback actions in introspection rules was removed.

* Old status records are no longer removed by default. They are still
  removed if a node is removed from Ironic.

### Deprecation Notes[Â¶](#deprecation-notes "Link to this heading")

* The `node_status_keep_time` configuration option is deprecated.
  Now that we can remove status information about nodes removed from
  **ironic**, this option does not make much sense,
  and [may be confusing](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1695858)

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-6-0-0-stable-pike-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Timeout in an active state led to an
  [undefined transition error](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1662494).
  This is fixed and an introspection finishes now with `Timeout` error.

* `0.0.0.0` and an empty string in the `bmc_address` inventory field
  are now correctly treated as missing BMC address.

* For postgreSQL, the database migration command `ironic-inspector-dbsync upgrade` always
  failed (with [enum NODE\_STATE does not exist](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1696950)).
  This is fixed and the migration now works.

* Do not fail the whole introspection due to a value formatting error during
  introspection rules rollback. See [bug 1686942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1686942) for an example
  and detailed investigation.

# Ocata Series (5.0.0 - 5.0.x) Release Notes

# Ocata Series (5.0.0 - 5.0.x) Release Notes[Â¶](#ocata-series-5-0-0-5-0-x-release-notes "Link to this heading")

## 5.0.2-8[Â¶](#relnotes-5-0-2-8-origin-stable-ocata "Link to this heading")

### Security Issues[Â¶](#security-issues "Link to this heading")

* Fixes insufficient input filtering when looking up a node by information
  from the introspection data. It could potentially allow SQL injections
  via the `/v1/continue` API endpoint. See [story 2005678](https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2005678) for details.

## 5.0.1[Â¶](#relnotes-5-0-1-origin-stable-ocata "Link to this heading")

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Exception CalledProcessError is raised when running iptables cmd on start up.
  The issue is caused by eventlet bug, see:
  <https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/357>
  The issue affects *ironic-inspector* only if it manages firewall - configured
  with `manage_firewall = True` configuration option.

* Do not fail the whole introspection due to a value formatting error during
  introspection rules rollback. See [bug 1686942](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/%2Bbug/1686942) for an example
  and detailed investigation.

## 5.0.0[Â¶](#relnotes-5-0-0-origin-stable-ocata "Link to this heading")

### New Features[Â¶](#new-features "Link to this heading")

* Extend the introspection status returned from
  `GET@/v1/introspection/<Node Id>` to contain the `uuid`, `started_at`
  and `finished_at` fields.

* Add a plugin to parse raw LLDP Basic Management, 802.1, and 802.3 TLVs and store the data in Swift.

* Add an API endpoint for listing introspection statuses. Operators can use
  this to get the status for all running or previously run introspection
  processing.

* Introduce a new configuration option `api_max_limit` that defines the
  maximum number of items per page when API results are paginated.

* InfiniBand interface discovery is now supported through introspection. The
  ironic-inspector will add the client-id to the corresponding ironic port
  that represents the InfiniBand interface. The ironic-inspector should be
  configured with a list of interfaces `firewall.ethoib_interfaces` to
  indicate which Ethernet Over InfiniBand Interfaces are used for DHCP.

* Node introspection state is now kept in a dedicated database column. The introspection is now using a finite state machine. The state isnât exposed to the user yet.

* Adds support for using operators with the root device hints mechanism. The supported operators are `=`, `==`, `!=`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `s==`, `s!=`, `s>=`, `s>`, `s<=`, `s<`, `<in>`, `<all-in>` and `<or>`.

* Looking up nodes during introspection or discovery now supports multiple
  attributes matching. For example, two nodes can use the same `bmc_address`
  and still can be distinguished by MAC addresses.

* Avoid failing introspection on diskless nodes. The node property `local_gb
  == 0` is set in that case.

### Known Issues[Â¶](#known-issues "Link to this heading")

* Due to the nature of the NodeInfo.state attribute (being updated independently from the rest of the node\_info attributes) if a (DB) connection was lost before the Node.state column was updated, Node.finished\_at and Node.error columns may not be in sync with the Node.state column.

### Upgrade Notes[Â¶](#upgrade-notes "Link to this heading")

* Add a new dependency, `pytz`.

* A database migration is required to change some columns from Float to
  DateTime type. This may take some time based on the number of introspection
  statuses in DB.

* Removed previously deprecated authentication options from âironicâ,
  âswiftâ, and âkeystone\_authtokenâ sections.

* Removed long deprecated support for âdiscoverdâ section in configuration
  file.

* The default value for the configuration option
  âintrospection\_delay\_driversâ was changed to `.*`, which means that by
  default âintrospection\_delayâ is now applied to all drivers. Set
  âintrospection\_delayâ to 0 to disable the delay.

* Node.state and Node.version\_id database columns are introduced.

* The introspection state column defaults to the state `finished` unless the introspection error column value on a node row isnât null, then node state is set to `error`.

* Uniqueness of a node `bmc_address` isnât enforced any more.

* The primary key of the `attributes` table is relaxed from the
  `attributes.name, attributes.value` column pair to a new column
  `attributes.uuid`.

### Deprecation Notes[Â¶](#deprecation-notes "Link to this heading")

* The configuration option âlog\_bmc\_addressâ is deprecated.

* Support for setting IPMI credentials via ironic-inspector is deprecated
  and will be removed completely in Pike. A new API version 1.9 was
  introduced with this feature de-activated. For reasoning see
  [https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/+bug/1654318](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/%2Bbug/1654318).

* The configuration option âintrospection\_delay\_driversâ is deprecated.

### Bug Fixes[Â¶](#relnotes-5-0-0-origin-stable-ocata-bug-fixes "Link to this heading")

* Change database columns `started_at` and `finished_at` to type
  DateTime from type Float so that timestamps fit into these columns
  correctly.

* Fix bug where periodic clean up failed with DBDeadlock if introspection
  timed out.

* Ensure the configuration options `firewall.firewall_update_period` and
  `clean_up_period` are applied to the `periodic_clean_up` and
  `periodic_update` tasks after the config file is read.

* LLC hook now formats the chassis ID and port ID MAC addresses into Unix format as expected by ironic.

* LLC hook ensures that correct port information is passed to the patch\_port function

* LLC hook no longer assumes all inspected ports are added to ironic

* Loopback BMC addresses (useful e.g. with virtualbmc) are no longer used
  for lookup.

* Introspection fails on nodes with the same IPMI address but different IPMI
  ports.

### Other Notes[Â¶](#other-notes "Link to this heading")

* Default API version is temporary pinned to 1.8 (before deprecating setting
  IPMI credentials). It will be reset to the latest version again when
  support for setting IPMI credentials is removed.
