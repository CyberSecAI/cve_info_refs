  "CVE-2019-10141": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "SQL Injection vulnerability in openstack-ironic-inspector when receiving introspection data.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `node_cache.find_node()` function in openstack-ironic-inspector constructs an SQL query using unfiltered data received from a server reporting introspection results via a POST request to the `/v1/continue` endpoint. This endpoint is unauthenticated, making it vulnerable.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "SQL Injection"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker with network access to the ironic-inspector service could potentially exploit this vulnerability to create a denial of service by injecting malicious data into the SQL query. Data exfiltration is unlikely due to how the query results are used, but database manipulation is possible.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Network access to the ironic-inspector service.",
          "Sending malicious data in a POST request to the `/v1/continue` endpoint."
      ],
       "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs network access to the ironic-inspector service to send crafted requests."
