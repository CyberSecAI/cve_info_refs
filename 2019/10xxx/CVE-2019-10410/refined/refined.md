  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Log Parser Plugin did not properly escape an error message displayed when log parsing patterns were invalid.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output escaping"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who can control the log parsing rules configuration (typically users with Job/Configure permission) could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the context of other users' browsers when viewing the build log.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker with Job/Configure permission could inject malicious script into the log parsing rules configuration.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have Job/Configure permissions in Jenkins."

        "fix_versions": "Log Parser Plugin 2.1",
    "notes": "Jenkins applies the missing escaping by default since 2.146 and LTS 2.138.2, so newer Jenkins releases are not affected by this vulnerability."
