-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

Advisory ID: SYSS-2019-012
Product: LOGO!
Manufacturer: Siemens
Affected Version(s): LOGO! 8 (all versions)
Tested Version(s): LOGO! 8, 6ED1052-2MD00-0BA8 FS:03, 0BA8.Standard V1.08.03
Vulnerability Type: Use of Hard-coded Cryptographic Key (CWE-321)
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: Open
Manufacturer Notification: 2019-04-04
Solution Date: 2019-05-14 (recommended mitigation by manufacturer)
Public Disclosure: 2019-05-29
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-10920
Authors of Advisory: Manuel Stotz, Matthias Deeg (SySS GmbH)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Overview:

Siemens LOGO! is a programmable logic controller (PLC) for small
automation tasks.

The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):

"Simple installation, minimum wiring, user-friendly programming: You can
easily implement small automation projects with LOGO!, the intelligent
logic module from Siemens. The LOGO! Logic Module saves space in the
control cabinet, and lets you easily implement functions, such as
time-delay switches, time relays, counters and auxiliary relays. "

Due to the use of a hard-coded cryptographic key, an attacker can put
the integrity and confidentiality of encrypted data of all LOGO! 8 PLCs
using this key at risk, for instance decrypting network communication
during a man-in-the-middle attack.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Vulnerability Details:

SySS GmbH found out that LOGO! PLCs use a static, hard-coded
cryptographic 3DES key for protecting sensitive information, like
network communication and configuration data.

For instance, this key can be found within the LOGO! Soft Comfort
software.

By knowing this static cryptographic 3DES key, an attacker can decrypt
all LOGO! data that is encrypted with this key and gain access to
sensitive data, for instance different configured passwords.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Proof of Concept (PoC):

SySS GmbH used the hard-coded cryptographic 3DES key in a software tool
(Nmap script) for extracting sensitive data such as configured passwords
as cleartext.

The following Nmap output exemplarily shows extracting password data
from a LOGO! 8 PLC:

$ nmap -p 10005 --script slig.nse 192.168.10.112
Starting Nmap 7.70 ( <https://nmap.org> ) at 2019-04-04 09:35 CEST

A successful attack against a LOGO! 8 extracting all configured
passwords is demonstrated in our SySS PoC video [5].

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Solution:

In the publicly released Siemens Security Advisory SSA-542701 [3],
the manufacturer Siemens recommends to apply a defense-in-depth concept,
including protection concept outlined in the system manual, as a
mitigation for reducing the risk of the described security issue.

SUMMARY

Multiple vulnerabilities have been identiﬁed in SIEMENS LOGO!8 BM devices. The most severe vulnera-
bility could lead to an attacker reading and modifying the device conﬁguration if the attacker has access
to port 10005/tcp.

Siemens has released an update for the LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants) and recommends that
customers update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants):
All versions < V8.3

Update to V8.3. Notice that in order to update, a
new hardware version is required.

view/109783346/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply Defense-in-Depth concept, including protection concept outlined in the system manual.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siemens LOGO! BM (Base Module) devices are used for basic small-scale automation tasks.

SIPLUS extreme products are designed for reliable operation under extreme conditions and are based on
SIMATIC, LOGO!, SITOP, SINAMICS, SIMOTION, SCALANCE or other devices. SIPLUS devices use the
same ﬁrmware as the product they are based on.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

SSA-542701

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10919

Attackers with access to port 10005/tcp could perform device reconﬁgurations and obtain project ﬁles
from the devices. The system manual recommends to protect access to this port.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker with network access to
port 10005/tcp. No user interaction is required to exploit this security vulnerability. The vulnerability
impacts conﬁdentiality, integrity, and availability of the device.
