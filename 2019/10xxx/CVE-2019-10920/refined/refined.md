  "summary": "The Siemens LOGO! 8 programmable logic controller (PLC) uses a hard-coded cryptographic 3DES key to protect sensitive information such as network communication and configuration data. An attacker knowing this key can decrypt all LOGO! data encrypted with it, gaining access to sensitive data such as configured passwords.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The Siemens LOGO! 8 PLC uses a static, hard-coded cryptographic 3DES key.",
    "vulnerability": "Use of a hard-coded cryptographic key (CWE-321).",
    "impact": "An attacker can decrypt all LOGO! data encrypted with the hardcoded key and gain access to sensitive data, such as configured passwords, and put the integrity and confidentiality of encrypted data at risk.",
    "attack_vector": "Knowing the static cryptographic 3DES key allows decryption of encrypted data, potentially through a man-in-the-middle attack on network communication.",

  "remediation": "Siemens recommends applying a defense-in-depth concept, including the protection concept outlined in the system manual, as a mitigation. Update to V8.3. Notice that in order to update, a new hardware version is required.",
