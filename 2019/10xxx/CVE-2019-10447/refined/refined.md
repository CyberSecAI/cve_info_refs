Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10447:

**CVE-2019-10447**

*   **Vulnerability:** The Sofy.AI Plugin stores an API token unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin stores the API token in plain text within the configuration files.
*   **Weaknesses:**

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker requires either:
        *   "Extended Read" permissions within Jenkins, or
        *   Direct access to the Jenkins controller file system.
*   **Additional Information:** As of the publication of the advisory, there is no fix available for this vulnerability.
