      "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer under-read in the Service Location Protocol (SRVLOC) dissector.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap-based buffer under-read"
      ],
      "impact": "A remote attacker could cause Wireshark to crash by injecting malformed SRVLOC packets or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file, resulting in a denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Injecting malformed SRVLOC packets onto the network",
