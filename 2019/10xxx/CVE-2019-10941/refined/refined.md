- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing authentication for a critical function that requires administrative user identity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing Authentication (CWE-306).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An unauthenticated attacker can obtain encoded system configuration backup files.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the affected system is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires network access to the affected system and no system privileges are required for exploitation. A user interaction is required (UI:R)
