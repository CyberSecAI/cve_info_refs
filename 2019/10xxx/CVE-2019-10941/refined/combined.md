SUMMARY

The latest update for SINEMA Server ﬁxes a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to
obtain encoded system conﬁguration backup ﬁles under certain conditions.

Siemens has released an update for the SINEMA Server and recommends to update to the latest version.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SINEMA Server:
All versions < V14 SP3

Update to V14 SP3 or later version

view/109801374/

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Monitor and restrict network access to device port 443/tcp and 80/tcp to trusted IP addresses

• Consider adding to your monitoring capabilities an allowed time window for system conﬁguration
backup download. This will be an auxiliar to create a baseline and monitor for abnormal behavior

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Industrial Ethernet networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:

Vulnerability CVE-2019-10941

Missing authentication for functionality that requires administrative user identity could allow an attacker
to obtain encoded system conﬁguration backup ﬁles. This is only possible through network access to
the affected system, and successful exploitation requires no system privileges.
