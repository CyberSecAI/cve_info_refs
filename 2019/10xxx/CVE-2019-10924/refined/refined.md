- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Deserialization of untrusted data. The software is vulnerable when opening a manipulated project file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of deserialized data leading to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, the vulnerability is categorized as CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the engineering station. Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves tricking a legitimate user into opening a manipulated project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to create a malicious project file and convince a user to open it on a system running the vulnerable software. No further privileges are required on the target system.
