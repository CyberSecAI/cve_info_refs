Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-10144:

*   **Vulnerability:** When using `rkt enter`, processes inside the container are granted all capabilities during stage 2. This means the container isn't properly isolated.
*   **Root Cause:** The `rkt enter` command does not properly isolate processes within containers, leading to privilege escalation.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of proper capability restrictions for processes entered via `rkt enter`.
*   **Impact:** A compromised container could exploit this flaw to gain unauthorized access to host resources.
*   **Attack Vector:** Executing commands within a container using `rkt enter`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have compromised a container and be able to execute commands using `rkt enter`.
*   **Affected Component:** rkt container runtime.
