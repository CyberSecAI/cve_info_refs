Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10987:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Out-of-Bounds Write:** Specifically, the vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write, which allows writing data beyond the allocated memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Administrator Context:** The code execution occurs in the context of the Administrator, potentially granting full control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **IOCTL:** The vulnerability is triggered through specific IOCTLs:
    *  `0x2723 IOCTL` in `webvrpcs` process (from one ZDI advisory)
    *  `0x2711 IOCTL` in `webvrpcs` process accessing `bwdraw.exe` (from another ZDI advisory)
*   **Lack of Authentication:** Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The vulnerability is described as having a low skill level to exploit.
*   **User Interaction**: According to the us-cert advisory, user interaction may be required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Advantech WebAccess/SCADA versions 8.3.5 and prior are affected.
*   **Affected Vendors**: Advantech
*   **Patch Availability**: Advantech has released version 8.4.1 to address this vulnerability.

The two ZDI advisories, though referring to the same CVE, identify different vulnerable code paths within the Advantech WebAccess product:
 * One points to `0x2723 IOCTL` within `webvrpcs`
 * Another one indicates  `bwdraw.exe` accessed through `0x2711 IOCTL` in `webvrpcs` as the vulnerable path.

The US-CERT advisory lists multiple vulnerabilities for Advantech WebAccess/SCADA and assigns each one a specific CVE, including CVE-2019-10987, which is categorized as an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. It is assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 and an attack vector of network with a low attack complexity.
