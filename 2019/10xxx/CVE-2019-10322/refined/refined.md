Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10322:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `doTestConnection` method in the Artifactory plugin lacks proper permission checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Permission Check:** The `testConnection` endpoint, exposed by the `doTestConnection` method, does not verify if the user has the required permissions to perform the action. This allows users with Overall/Read access to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The `doTestConnection` endpoint lacks CSRF validation, making it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This allows an attacker to craft a request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, will execute the malicious action.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credentials Disclosure:** Attackers can use the vulnerability to capture credentials stored in Jenkins by forcing the server to send them to an attacker-controlled URL, through the `Authorization` header in the HTTP request to the attacker server, which include base64 encoded credentials.
- **Arbitrary URL Connection**: The attacker can specify an arbitrary URL and have the Jenkins server attempt a connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Request:** An attacker can directly send a crafted HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint if they have Overall/Read permissions.
- **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can embed a malicious request on a webpage that is loaded by an authenticated user. Due to the lack of CSRF protection, the user's browser will execute the request with their credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Overall/Read Permissions:** The attacker must have at least Overall/Read permissions in Jenkins to exploit the missing permission check.
- **Knowledge of Credential ID:** The attacker needs to know a valid `credentialsId` to leak specific credentials. This can be obtained through other vulnerabilities in the same or different plugins.
- **Ability to Host Webpage:** For CSRF attack, the attacker needs to be able to host a malicious webpage or inject the malicious code to a legitimate website.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `org.jfrog.hudson.ArtifactoryBuilder` class.
- The request to the attacker-controlled server includes the credentials in the `Authorization` header.
- The response from the attacker-controlled server is not rendered to the user due to the plugin not being able to interpret the data, however, the request to the attacker-controlled server still executes.
- The vulnerability can be exploited by anonymous users if anonymous read access is enabled on Jenkins.

This analysis provides more detail than the original CVE description, especially about the way the credentials are sent to the attacker's server and the specific methods within the plugin that are vulnerable.
