SSA-632562:
communication modules and devices

Vulnerabilities in SIPROTEC 5 Ethernet plug-in

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8

V1.2

SUMMARY

The SIPROTEC 5 Ethernet plug-in communication modules and devices are affected by multiple security
vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to leverage various attacks, e.g. to execute
arbitrary code over the network.

The underlying Wind River VxWorks network stack is affected by eleven vulnerabilities known as ‘UR-
GENT/11’. Of these, two DHCP-related vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-12257 and CVE-2019-12264) do not
apply to this advisory as the listed products use a different DHCP stack.

One further vulnerability affects the boot process of the device under certain conditions.

Siemens has released updates and recommends that customers update to the new versions.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Use a ﬁrewall to block trafﬁc with “TCP Urgent Pointer” set to mitigate CVE-2019-12255, CVE-
2019-12260, CVE-2019-12261, and CVE-2019-12263. See https://www.windriver.com/security/
announcements/tcp-ip-network-stack-ipnet-urgent11/ for more information.

• Use a ﬁrewall to block trafﬁc with IP-options SSRR (Strict Source and Record Route) or LSRR
(Loose Source and Record Route) to mitigate CVE-2019-12256. See https://support2.windriver.
com/index.php?page=cve&on=view&id=CVE-2019-12256 for more information.

• Use a ﬁrewall to block trafﬁc with destination port 443/TCP or activate the role-based access control

feature or the connection password feature in the device to mitigate CVE-2019-10938.

• To resolve CVE-2019-10938 for SIPROTEC 5 CP300 and CP100 CPU variant update to ﬁrmware
version V7.90 or higher and update DIGSI 5 to V7.90 or higher from https://support.industry.siemens.
com/cs/ww/en/ and activate the client authorization feature. Applying the update causes the device
or module to go through a single restart cycle.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to build
resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

Recommended security guidelines to Secure Substations can be found at:

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIPROTEC 5 devices provide a range of integrated protection, control, measurement, and automation
functions for electrical substations and other ﬁelds of application.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

SUMMARY

Siemens low & high voltage power meters are affected by multiple security vulnerabilities due to the
underlying Wind River VxWorks network stack. This stack is affected by eleven vulnerabilities known as
the “URGENT/11”.

The vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute a variety of exploits for the purpose of Denial-of-
Service (DoS), data extraction, RCE, etc. targeting both availability and conﬁdentiality of the devices and
data.

Siemens is working on updates for the affected products, and recommends countermeasures until ﬁxes
are available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Apply appropriate strategies for mitigation on the network level to ensure affected devices are as

segmented.

• Apply Defense-in-Depth: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Siemens 9410 series power and engery meters help meet the needs of your energy monitoring and
cost management applications. These meters are ideally suited to local and remote monitoring of low or
high-voltage electrical installations in industrial facilities, commercial buildings, utility networks or critical
power environments.

The Siemens 9810 high accuracy and advanced power quality meter combines accurate; 3-phase energy
and power measurement with data logging, power quality analysis, e-mail, alarming, Modbus mastering,
Transient detection, Pre-Event/Post-Event Waveform capture and extensive I/O capablities in a highly
ﬂexible modular format.
