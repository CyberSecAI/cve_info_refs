Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-10938:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the boot process of the affected devices, where an attacker can insert arbitrary code that executes before firmware verification.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper Access Control (CWE-284): The device does not properly control access during the boot process, allowing unauthorized code injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the device.
- The potential for complete compromise of the device, as the attacker has control before the firmware is verified.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network access: The attacker needs network access to the device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Unauthenticated attacker with network access. No user interaction is required.

**Affected Products:**
- SIPROTEC 5 devices with CPU variants CP200 (all versions < V7.59)
- Siemens Power Meters Series 9410 (all versions < V2.2.1)
- Siemens Power Meters Series 9810 (all versions)

**Mitigation:**
- Update to the specified firmware versions for affected devices:
    - SIPROTEC 5 devices with CPU variants CP200: update to firmware version V7.59 or higher
    - SIPROTEC 5 CP300 and CP100 CPU variant update to firmware version V7.90 or higher
    - Siemens Power Meters Series 9410: update to firmware version V2.2.1
    - Siemens Power Meters Series 9810: update to firmware version V2.2.1
- Use a firewall to block traffic with destination port 443/TCP.
- Activate role-based access control or the connection password feature in the device.
- Activate the client authorization feature after updating to firmware version V7.90 or higher and DIGSI 5 to V7.90 or higher for SIPROTEC 5 CP300 and CP100.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as allowing an attacker to insert arbitrary code that is executed before firmware verification.
- The CVSS v3.1 Base Score is 9.8, indicating critical severity.
- There was no known public exploitation of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory publication.
