The provided content describes a file upload vulnerability in Cobub Razor.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `uploadify.php` file where there is a lack of file type restrictions during file upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The `uploadify.php` script does not validate the type or extension of the uploaded file.
- Direct use of user-controlled data: The `$_REQUEST['folder']` parameter, which is controlled by the user, is directly used to construct the target path for file uploads.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file upload: An attacker can upload malicious files, such as PHP scripts, to the server.
- Remote code execution: By uploading and executing a malicious PHP script, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to `/razor/web/assets/swf/uploadify.php` with a `folder` parameter and a file named `Filedata` in the multipart form data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server running the vulnerable Cobub Razor application.
- No authentication is required.
