Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The `promise-probe` package is vulnerable to command injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled inputs passed to the `ffprobe(file)` and `createMuteOgg(outputFile, options)` functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection (CWE-78):** The application constructs shell commands using user-provided input without proper sanitization or escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Impact:**  Full disclosure of all resources within the impacted component is possible.
- The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the application using `promise-probe` is running.
- This could potentially lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
- Examples provided in the PoC demonstrate arbitrary command execution (creating files via `touch`).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying malicious input to the `file`, `outputFile`, or `options` parameters of the vulnerable functions.
- Input is not sanitized which means user-supplied values are passed directly into the shell commands

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input values passed to the `ffprobe()` and `createMuteOgg()` functions within an application utilizing the vulnerable version of the `promise-probe` package.
- No privileges are required, and user interaction is not required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Attack is remotely exploitable over a network.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected versions: Versions prior to 0.10.0 of the `promise-probe` package are affected.
- The vulnerability was disclosed by JHU System Security Lab.
- The fix is to upgrade to version 0.10.0 or higher.
- Snyk has assigned the ID `SNYK-JS-PROMISEPROBE-546816` to this vulnerability.
- The CVSS score from Snyk is 7.5 (High), while NVD provides a score of 9.8 (Critical)
