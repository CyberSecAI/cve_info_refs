**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Storing sensitive information (credentials) in plain text
- Insecure storage of credentials within the Jenkins controller's file system

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system could view the unencrypted credential.
- This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to Bitbucket resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the Jenkins controller's file system is the primary attack vector.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the Jenkins controller file system to be able to read the `config.xml` file. This could be achieved through compromised accounts or direct access to the server.
