**********************************************************************
Discovered By: Kevin Randall on 3/23/2019
**********************************************************************
A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in the Web GUI in Titan FTP Server 2019 Build 3505.
When an authenticated user attempts to preview an uploaded file (through PreviewHandler.ashx) by using a \..\..\ technique, arbitrary files can
be loaded in the server response outside the root directory.
***********************************************************************
Tools used:

Parrot OS

Windows 7 32 Bit

BurpSuite

Browser
*************************************************************************
Vulnerability has been fixed in the following build:
Build: Titan FTP Server 2019 Build 3515
**************************************************************************
Proof of Concept (PoC):

Step 1: Authenticate through Titan FTP Web GUI

Step 2: Upload file and attempt to view it

Step 3: Intercept requests with BurpSuite when attempting to view uploaded file

Step 4: Modify "path=" and "filename=" parameters in the following GET request:
Ex: View contents of README.txt file in Python27 directory:
Note: You can access other files in directories such as System32, Desktop etc.
Payload:
*****************************************************************************************
GET /PreviewHandler.ashx?path=\..\..\..\..\Python27\README.txt&filename=README.txt
*****************************************************************************************
Step 5: If path is set-up correctly and if file exists, you will receive a 200 OK back from the server.

Step 6: View the file through the file preview in the FTP server.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

Discovered By: Kevin Randall on 3/23/2019
**********************************************************************
A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in the Web GUI in Titan FTP
Server 2019 Build 3505.
When an authenticated user attempts to preview an uploaded file (through
PreviewHandler.ashx) by using a \..\..\ technique, arbitrary files can
be loaded in the server response outside the root directory.
***********************************************************************
Tools used:

Parrot OS

Windows 7 32 Bit

BurpSuite

Browser
*************************************************************************
Vulnerability has been fixed in the following build:

Note: You can access other files in directories such as System32, Desktop
etc.
        Payload:
*****************************************************************************************
GET
/PreviewHandler.ashx?path=\..\..\..\..\Python27\README.txt&filename=README.txt
*****************************************************************************************

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

**********************************************************************
Discovered By: Kevin Randall on 3/23/2019
**********************************************************************
A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in the Web GUI in Titan FTP
Server 2019 Build 3505.
When an authenticated user attempts to preview an uploaded file (through
PreviewHandler.ashx) by using a \..\..\ technique, arbitrary files can
be loaded in the server response outside the root directory.
***********************************************************************
Tools used:

Parrot OS

Windows 7 32 Bit

BurpSuite

Browser
*************************************************************************
Vulnerability has been fixed in the following build:
Build: Titan FTP Server 2019 Build 3515
**************************************************************************
Proof of Concept (PoC):

Step 1: Authenticate through Titan FTP Web GUI

Step 2: Upload file and attempt to view it

Step 3: Intercept requests with BurpSuite when attempting to view uploaded
file

Step 4: Modify "path=" and "filename=" parameters in the following GET
request:
Ex: View contents of README.txt file in Python27 directory:
Note: You can access other files in directories such as System32, Desktop
etc.
        Payload:
*****************************************************************************************
GET
/PreviewHandler.ashx?path=\..\..\..\..\Python27\README.txt&filename=README.txt
*****************************************************************************************
Step 5: If path is set-up correctly and if file exists, you will receive a
200 OK back from the server.

Step 6: View the file through the file preview in the FTP server.

# Nmap: Discover your network

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a
[free and open source](/npsl/) utility for
network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network
administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network
inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services (application
name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet
filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It
was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against
single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and
official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS
X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap
suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer
([Zenmap](/zenmap/)), a flexible data
transfer, redirection, and debugging tool
([Ncat](/ncat/)), a utility for
comparing scan results ([Ndiff](/ndiff/)), and a packet generation and response analysis tool ([Nping](/nping/)).

Nmap was named “Security Product of the Year” by Linux
Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It
was even featured in [twelve
movies](/movies/), including
[The Matrix Reloaded](/movies/#matrix),
[Die Hard 4](/movies/#diehard4),
[Girl With the Dragon Tattoo](/movies/#gwtdt),
and
[The Bourne Ultimatum](/movies/#bourne).

Nmap is ...

* Nmap
  Security
  Port Scanner
* **Flexible**: Supports dozens of advanced techniques for
  mapping out networks filled with IP filters, firewalls, routers, and
  other obstacles. This includes many [port scanning](/book/man-port-scanning-techniques.html) mechanisms (both TCP &
  UDP), [OS
  detection](/book/osdetect.html), [version detection](/book/vscan.html), ping sweeps, and more. See the [documentation page](/docs.html).* **Powerful**: Nmap has been used to scan huge networks of
    literally hundreds of thousands of machines.* **Portable**: Most operating systems are supported, including
      Linux,
      Microsoft Windows,
      FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD,
      Solaris,
      IRIX,
      Mac OS X,
      HP-UX,
      NetBSD,
      Sun OS,
      Amiga,
      and more.* **Easy**: While Nmap offers a rich set of advanced features for
        power users, you can start out as simply as "nmap -v -A *targethost*". Both traditional command line and graphical (GUI)
        versions are available to suit your preference. Binaries are
        available for those who do not wish to compile Nmap from source.* **Free**: The primary goals of the Nmap Project is to help make
          the Internet a little more secure and to provide
          administrators/auditors/hackers with an advanced tool for exploring
          their networks. Nmap is available for [free download](https://nmap.org/download.html), and also comes with full
          source code that you may modify and redistribute under the terms of
          the [license](data/COPYING).* **Well Documented**: Significant effort has been put into
            comprehensive and up-to-date man pages, whitepapers, tutorials, and
            even a whole book! Find them in multiple
            languages [here](/docs.html).* **Supported**: While Nmap comes with no warranty, it is well supported by a vibrant community of developers and users. Most of this interaction occurs on the [Nmap mailing lists](#lists). Most bug reports and questions should be sent to the [nmap-dev list](https://seclists.org/nmap-dev), but only after you read the [guidelines](/book/man-bugs.html). We recommend that all users subscribe to the low-traffic [nmap-hackers](https://seclists.org/nmap-hackers) announcement list. You can also find Nmap on [Facebook](http://facebook.com/nmap) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/nmap). For real-time chat, join the #nmap channel on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) or [EFNet](http://www.efnet.org/).* **Acclaimed**: Nmap has won numerous awards, including
                "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal, Info
                World and Codetalker Digest. It has been featured in hundreds of
                magazine articles, several movies, dozens of books, and one comic book
                series. Visit the [press page](nmap_inthenews.html)
                for further details.* **Popular**: Thousands of people download Nmap every day, and
                  it is included with many operating systems (Redhat Linux, Debian
                  Linux, Gentoo, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc). It is among the top ten (out of
                  30,000) programs at the Freshmeat.Net repository. This is important
                  because it lends Nmap its vibrant development and user support
                  communities.

## Communication

Nmap users are encouraged to subscribe to the *Nmap-hackers*
mailing list. It is a low volume (6 posts in 2017), moderated list
for the most important announcements about Nmap, Insecure.org, and
related projects. You can join more than 128,000 current subscribers
by submitting your email address here:

(or subscribe with custom options from the [Nmap-hackers list info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/announce))

We also have a development list for more hardcore members
(especially programmers) who are interested in helping the project by
helping with coding, testing, feature ideas, etc. New (test/beta)
versions of Nmap are sometimes released here prior to general
availability for QA purposes. You can subscribe at the [Nmap-dev list
info page](https://nmap.org/mailman/listinfo/dev).

Both lists are archived (along with many other security lists) at [Seclists.org](https://seclists.org).

Though it isn't nearly as active as the mailing lists, the official IRC channel is #nmap on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/) (irc.freenode.net).

The benefit of this feature is that it will allow the administrator to omit potentially sensitive information from being dumped to the logfile. * New: Added the ability in srxCFG to "+" add a user to a group by using "+|groupname|groupname|". The + tells the engine to preserve existing group membership * New: After the SSH handshake has completed, the negotiated cipher/mac/compression information is dumped to the server logfile. * Updated: All security engines and toolkits in Titan have been hardened and upgraded to the latest releases. This includes SSH, SSL, and TLS. * Updated: Updated the way Disk Usage information is returned in a DQTA command. If disk quotas are not enabled on the server, the server now returns the current bytes in use by the user, with a quota of 0. In v10 and earlier the overall server usage was returned. * Fixed: Issue in the Titan service which could cause a delay in the service stopping on occasion. * Fixed: Issue in ADSI/LDAP authentication which could cause the WebUI to fail on occasion because of a COM error. * Fixed: Issue in the COMB command for FTP which could fail to combine a file if the filename contained spaces and the segments were quoted. * Fixed: Virtual Folders are now accessible through the Web Interface. Tickets: [ZEN-557-85918], [XLH-207-10375], [TPE-919-82839] . * Fixed: Unicode characters are now logged properly in the Events Manager when writing to a custom logfile.

Meaning that if 173.1.2.3 was already in the list, 73.1.2.3 would not be added properly. This gave the false impression that the IP Access List would 'max-out' at a certain number of entries. * Fixed: But in the Events Manager which would cause double-free of memory and could cause the service to crash under certain situations. * Fixed: SFTP issue which could cause a memory leak if the client application timed-out or canceled an upload mid-stream. * Fixed: PGP issue which could cause a decrypt failure if streaming PGP was being used and the encrypted file had an odd block size. (Cornerstone MFT) * Fixed: srxCFG issue which failed to add a user to the proper groups when the user was initially created. This problem also occurred with users not being added to a group when the group was created. * Fixed: srxCFG issue which failed to return the DirAccess and VirtFolders information on a GET\*ATTR call. * Fixed: SFTP Issue which could cause the client to fail to recognize a virtual folder if it was in the user's home directory and referenced a UNC. * Fixed: During SFTP Public Key Authentication, the logfile now records the MD5 fingerprint of the raw/unencoded public key instead of the encoded public key. This helps to cross check the MD5 hash with other programs. * Fixed: The SFTP engine now supports stronger PCI compliant ciphers and macs including hmac-sha2-224, hmac-sha2-384, hmac-sha2-256, and hmac-sha2-512. * Fixed: The Certificate Manager and Host Key manager would allow a user to accidentally enter a blank space in the password.

| * Updated: Increased the size of internal SFTP buffers from 16K to 64K for high-latency networks. * Fixed: In the SSL Certificate Wizard, the email address field is now required. * Fixed: When uploading multiple files in the WebUI, the Upload event was only being fired after that final file was uploaded; not after each file. (Ticket: DMQ-424-35066) * Fixed: During an MLST command, the server might return 550 Access Denied if NT or ADSI authentication was being used in conjunction with Impersonation and the NT Service Account being used by the Titan/Cornerstone service did not have adequate NTFS permisions to access the underlying directory specified in the MLST command. * Fixed: "Invalid Server Path" was being displayed in the WebUI when accessing sub-directories of Virtual Folders. This would also manifest itself as a user not being able to browse sub-directories of Virtual Folders in the WebUI. This bug was introduced in v10.40 as a result of the patches for the security vulnerabilities CVE-2014-1841, CVE-2014-1842, and CVE-2014-1843. | |

| Version: 9.0 | Release Date: January 17, 2012 |
| * Added: Internationalization Support. Titan FTP Server v9 is completely UNICODE based   which will allow the server to access, store, and manage an unlimited number of   files in an unlimited number of languages/character sets at the same time. [[photo]](http://www.southrivertech.com/_images/cs/csmulticharsets.jpg) * Added: Ability to ban files that do not have an extension. For Example: "\*." * Added: The SMTP Email Tab now supports the ability to add a special custom port   instead of the default SMTP Port. * Added: Ability to use secure SMTP Email over SSL/TLS. * Added: Ability to handle chained CA certificates, specifically when Entrust hands   down a certificate signed by an intermediate CA. * Added: Ability to assign a Primary Group to a user. In previous versions of Titan   FTP Server, users were able to inherit some of their configuration values from a   group which they were a member of. However, since there was no way to pick the group   from which the user would inherit their settings, it was not consistent which settings   the user would inherit. In Titan FTP Server v9 and later, each user will be assigned   to at most 1 Primary Group. This Primary Group information will be used to determine   where a user will inherit their setting from if inheritance is being used at the   user level. * Added: Support for multiple host-keys for a given user. Users can now have one or   more host-keys assigned to their user account. If the client presents any of the   host-keys, they are authenticated. * Changed: In previous versions of Titan FTP Server, an Everyone group would be created   even when the server was configured for non-native authentication. In Titan FTP   Server v9 and later, the Everyone group will not be created on new servers unless   native authentication is being used. * Changed: Implemented MS recommended workaround for ASP issue described in [Microsoft KB-911272](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911272)   which could cause ASP to unload while the WebUI was executing. * Changed: In the New Server Wizard, Anonymous FTP is now disabled when non-native   authentication is being used. * Changed/Fixed: Issue in the Directory Access permissions which would prevent a subdirectory   from having no access if the parent had full access. Titan FTP Server now accepts   the concept of a null-ace, meaning that the Titan Admin can create a Directory Access   rule that has no permissions. This rule will keep someone from accessing a directory   even if the parent directory has been configured for Full Access with the 'Apply   To Subdirectories' option enabled. * Fixed: Various memory management issues which could cause the Web Interface front   end to go offline after a period of time because ASP.NET became unavailable. The   ASP.NET issues would also manifest themselves by slowly accumulating system memory   until the Titan FTP Server service would stop functioning. * Fixed: Various Admin issues dealing with the failure to properly enumerate groups   and users when using non-native user authentication. * Fixed: Various issues in the Virtual Folder subsystems which could prevent new Virtual   Folders from being added through the Virtual Folder Wizard and/or deleted or accessed. * Fixed: Various memory related issues which would slowly accumulate system memory   if the Titan Tray or Admin applications were left running for an extended period   of time. * Fixed: Various .NET and Web Interface related issues which would cause PCI scan   warnings. * Fixed: Various issues in the srxCFG utility and srxCOM engine which prevented access   and modification of various attributes. * Fixed: Various issues relating to the Flood Protection/DoS settings not being honored   when configured to ban someone for a short period of time. * Fixed: Issue in the SFTP engine which could cause the Idle Connection Manager to   close a connection as soon as it was established and before the user logged in. * Fixed: Issue in WebUI that prevented logon on Win32 platforms * Fixed: Quota issue that could result in uploads failing even though quota was not   exceeded. | |

| Version: 8.30.1231 | Release Date: December 21, 2010 |
| * Added: A "Kick User On Bad Hostkey" flag is now available in SFTP. If this flag   is enabled, the default, any FTP client that presents an invalid SFTP key will be   disconnected as if they supplied an invalid password. Turn this setting off to allow   SFTP clients the ability to connect and sequentially issue multiple SSH host keys   until a valid key is found. * Fixed: Internal memory issue which could cause a race condition in the Titan Service   if multiple servers were configured under a single domain and one or more servers   had an invalid IP address and Titan was installed on a fast quad-core multi-processor   box. * Fixed: Internal logic error which would prevent users from being properly displayed   in the Admin application as members of a group. * Fixed: Issue with non-native authentication which could prevent the Users from being displayed properly under the Members and Non-Members tab in the Admininstration application. * Fixed: The Permit SFTP flag at the Group and User level was not honoring the value   of the parent which could result in SFTP being disabled at a group level but enabled   at a user or server level. * Fixed: Added check boxes to the list of user host keys on the user SFTP tab to make   it a bit more obvious which host keys will be valid for any given user. * Fixed: The SFTP engine was not propely processing invalid username/password hacking   attempts and would fail to ban the IP address and not disconnect the user. * Fixed: Bug in SFTP v5 & v6 support whereby the extended OPEN flags were not being processed correctly causing uploads to fail. * Fixed: Issue with the database tables used by the Event Management System. When   upgrading from an older version of Titan Server, and   if no events existing, the event tables would not be created properly. While this   error did not prevent the server from running, it did prevent new events from being   created. * Fixed: Issue in the srxCOM interface which could cause a Windows error assertion   in "WinCtr2.cpp". * Fixed: The installer was not properly checking and installing ASPX and was not properly   registering some of the .NET objects needed for the WebUI to run. * Fixed: Updated the algorithm used in Passive Mode Accepts for FTP to help correct   a problem with an occasional 425 timeout during a data connection. * Fixed: Updated DMZ client keep-alive logic to better detect when a firewall is recycled. * Fixed: Event notification for file upload events with the web user interface. * Fixed: On the Shared Connections tab in the Admin app, the Allow EPASV setting was not being set correctly if it was different than the Allow PASV setting. | |
| Version: 8.22 | Release Date: September 15, 2010 |

A progress dialog box has now been added to illustrate progress. * Fixed: Issue which could cause certain FTP commands such as APPE, COMB, CWD, DELE,   MDTM, MKD, MLST, RETR, SIZE, STAT, STOR and XCRC to return Access Denied if the   file or path argument was located on a remote UNC share and Impersonation was being   used and the Titan Service was running under the context of the LocalSystem account. * Fixed: Issue where Titan would return \_NO\_SUCH\_PATH as an error code under SFTP   v3. The proper return code would be \_NO\_SUCH\_FILE in v3 since \_NO\_SUCH\_PATH was   not introduced until SFTP v4. * Fixed: Issue which would cause the Titan Service to crash during a directory listing   if it encountered a filename containing certain unicode characters. * Fixed: Potential Web Interface security issue. The 'web.config' file used for the   Titan Web Interface now has debugging turned off to increase performance and security. * Fixed: Potential issue with the way Titan generated the path and keyfile names for   SSH hostkeys which could result in a Titan not being able to load the keyfile for   the server or a user during authentication. * Fixed: When modifying the Base Server Data Directory or a User's Home Directory   in the Admin application, data could potentially fail to migrate to the new location   if a file by the same name already exists in the new destination location. * Fixed: When upgrading from a previous version of Titan, the installer will now provide   an installation option to install SQLExpress 2005 if it is not already installed   on the system. * Fixed: The Titan installer will properly detect if AJAX extensions are installed   on 64-bit systems and will only install them if necessary. * Fixed: Updated the logging subsystems for faster performance. * Fixed: Potential problem which could cause the Titan Service to appear to be hung   when it starts if one or more of the entries in the "Servers" key of the registry   were corrupt or could not be read. * Fixed: Problem with the "UNC Accounts" feature on 64-bit systems which could cause   the Titan Service to crash. * Fixed: Database issue which would fail to create proper indexes on sr\_ugidmap\_uid   and sr\_ugidmap\_gid when using non-native user authentication with Titan. This caused   performance issues with systems having a large number of Titan users (20,000+). * Fixed: Event Manager problem which could cause performance issues when a large number   of "Flagged For Review" events accumulated in the system. * Fixed: Memory leak in the Admin application which failed to release memory properly   when it closed. * Fixed: Streamlined the NT/SAM authentication interface to increase performance for   large installations of 100,000+ users and 100,000+ groups. * Fixed: Potential memory leak if NT/SAM user authentication was used and Impersonation was enabled. * Fixed: Login problem which could cause a "Login Failed" response when using Impersonation   with Titan and there were a large number of users accessing the system. * Fixed: Login problem which could cause a delay when logging in to Titan is Impersonation   was used. * Fixed: Timing issue which could cause the Titan Service to crash during startup   if multiple servers were defined on the domain, one or more of the servers was unable   to start, and the Titan Admin app was running and the Admin tried to manually start   the server repeatedly. * Fixed: When running with debug level logging, Titan would indicate that some of   the database query execution times were in 'milliseconds' when it was actually 'seconds'. * Fixed: Potential problem which could cause Titan to fail on various internal file   operations if it encountered a long path name of more than 250 bytes long. * Fixed: Potential problem which could cause Titan to fail on various internal file   operations such as 'Delete' or 'Rename' if Impersonation was used and the files   were stored on a UNC share. * Fixed: Parsing problem which would cause users to not appear in the Titan Admin   application when using non-native user authentication and the backend domain had more than 50,000 users or 50,000 groups. * Fixed: Timing issue which could cause the Titan Service to crash if the Admin attempted   to stop/start the very quickly while server was in use and under heavy load by many users. | |
| Version: 8.21 | Release Date: August 20, 2010 |
| * Fixed: Installation issue which could cause the Account being used by the Service to be reset to LocalService during an upgrade from an earlier release. * Fixed: Downloading a file over FTP or FTPS would sometimes return a 451 error when   using NT impersonation. * Fixed: Increased the SFTP server's listening pool buffer size to handle higher volumes   of SFTP traffic. This corrects an issue where Titan would reject some SFTP connections   when in a high volume installation. * Fixed: Updated the logic used to interact with the events management database. This   corrects an issue which would cause the server to record higher than necessary CPU   usage if there were thousands of events and flagged events configured in the system. * Fixed: Issue with the 'Spawn External Command' dialog box in the Events Management   UI which would allow for the creation of an action if no external command was specified. * Fixed: Issue with the 'Select file/folder' Condition dialog box in the Events Management   UI which would fail to store the selected file/foldername that was chosen when you   clicked on the '...' browse button. * Fixed: The File Progress information would sometimes fail to display during uploads   in the Web Interface Module. * Fixed: Large file uploads in the Web Interface Module would sometimes timeout and   the user would be returned to the main logon page. * Fixed: The 'Cancel Upload' button would sometimes fail to display during an upload   in the Web Interface Module. * Fixed: In the Admin application, hitting F5 would sometimes crash the application   if you had many servers configured for your domain. * Fixed: Issue with large uploads in the Web Interface Module which could cause ASP.NET   to crash after a period of inactivity between ASP.NET and Titan. This in turn would   bring down the Titan Service. * Fixed: Login issue when using NT/SAM authentication which could cause long delays   when logging in to the server, especially if Impersonation was enabled. * Fixed: The Local Administration Server logfile for the main domain was not honoring   the main Domain Log Directory setting in the Admin application. * Fixed: Added more detailed logging at the Domain level to help diagnose situations   where a server may have issues during startup. * Fixed: Memory allocation/release error that could cause the service to hang or crash   when using NT, A/D, or LDAP authentication. * Changed: Increased the connection timeout to 30 seconds on the SMTP/EMail configuration   dialogs in the Admin application to handle situations where connecting the the email   server takes a long time. | |
