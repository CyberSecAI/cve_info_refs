{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A directory traversal vulnerability exists within the web GUI when previewing uploaded files. The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'path' parameter of the PreviewHandler.ashx handler, allowing traversal using '\..\..\' sequences.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory Traversal, Local File Inclusion (LFI). The application does not properly validate user-provided paths, leading to an LFI vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An authenticated user can read arbitrary files on the server's filesystem outside of the intended web root.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface via a crafted HTTP GET request to 'PreviewHandler.ashx'. The attacker needs to manipulate the 'path' parameter to include directory traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Titan FTP Server web interface.  The attacker also needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests."
