Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10337:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Token Macro Plugin in Jenkins did not properly configure its XML parser, leaving it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) processing.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The plugin's XML parser was not configured to prevent the processing of external entities in XML documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could extract sensitive information from the Jenkins agent by leveraging external entities in a crafted XML file.
- **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attackers could force the Jenkins server to make requests to arbitrary URLs using external entities.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers could cause a denial of service by crafting an XML file with external entities that exhaust system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers could exploit the `${XML}` macro in the Token Macro Plugin by controlling the contents of files processed through it.
- By injecting specially crafted XML files with external entities, they could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to have the ability to control the contents of files processed by the `${XML}` macro.
- This means they need to be able to influence XML input files or their content which is parsed by the affected Jenkins plugin.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability involved configuring the XML parser to no longer process XML External Entities, preventing the attacks described above.
- The vulnerability affected versions of the Token Macro Plugin up to and including 2.7. Version 2.8 and later are not affected.
- The vulnerability was addressed in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 and 4.1 via security updates RHSA-2019:1851 and RHSA-2019:1636, respectively.
