CVE-2019-10406:
  - Root cause: Jenkins did not validate or limit the possible values for the Jenkins root URL.
  - Vulnerability: Cross-site scripting (XSS).
  - Impact: Exploitable by users with Overall/Administer permission, leading to XSS.
  - Attack vector: An attacker with Overall/Administer permission can set a malicious Jenkins root URL.
  - Fix: Jenkins now prevents non-HTTP/HTTPS URLs from being set as the Jenkins root URL. Instances with invalid root URLs will behave as if no root URL was set. A system property can be set to disable this restriction.
