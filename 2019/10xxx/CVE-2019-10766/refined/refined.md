Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the `limit()` parameter in the `usmanhalalit/pixie` library not being properly escaped. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The lack of sanitization or escaping of user-controlled input in the `limit()` parameter allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, which can then be executed by the database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality:**  An attacker could gain access to sensitive information by querying the database with malicious SQL. The impact is classified as "low" as the attacker does not have control over which information is obtained.
*   **Integrity:** An attacker can modify data within the database with malicious SQL, which is classified as "high" as there could be severe consequences.
*   **Availability:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by crafting malicious SQL queries that could disrupt the database service. This is considered a "high" impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerable component is bound to the network, making it remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:** The attacker doesn't need any prior access to the system.
*   **No user interaction:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any user interaction.
*   **Low attack complexity:** Exploitation is straightforward and does not require special conditions.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected versions:** Versions of `usmanhalalit/pixie` prior to 1.0.3, >=2.0.0 and <2.0.2 are vulnerable.
*   **Proof of Concept:** A detailed PoC is provided, demonstrating how to inject SQL code using the `limit()` function.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability can be fixed by upgrading to version 1.0.3 or 2.0.2 or higher.
*   **CVSS Score:** Snyk gives a score of 9.4 (critical) and NVD gives a score of 9.8 (critical).
