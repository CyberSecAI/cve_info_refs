vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (1) / CVE-2019-10471 (CSRF), CVE-2019-10472 (permission check)
Libvirt Slaves Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read access to
Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH server using
attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1014 (2) / CVE-2019-10473
Libvirt Slaves Plugin provides a list of applicable credential IDs to allow
users configuring the plugin to select the one to use.

This functionality does not correctly check permissions, allowing any user
with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials IDs. Those
can be used as part of an attack to capture the credentials using another
vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1073 / CVE-2019-10474
Global Post Script Plugin does not perform permission checks on a method
implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
permission to list the files contained in $JENKINS_HOME/global-post-script
that can be used by the plugin.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1490 / CVE-2019-10475
build-metrics Plugin does not properly escape the label query parameter,
resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

# Mattermost plugin for Jenkins

This plugin allows users to send build notifications to a self-hosted [Mattermost](http://www.mattermost.org/) installation.

It is based on a fork of the Slack plugin: <https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin/>

The Slack plugin was a fork of the HipChat plugin: <https://github.com/jlewallen/jenkins-hipchat-plugin>

Which in turn, was a fork of the Campfire plugin.

It includes [Jenkins Pipeline](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin) support as of version 2.0:

```
mattermostSend color: 'good', message: 'Message from Jenkins Pipeline', text: 'optional for @here mentions and searchable text'

```

# Jenkins Instructions

1. The first step is to set up a Mattermost server
2. Then Configure an incoming webhook
3. Install this plugin on your Jenkins server
4. **Add it as a Post-build action** in your Jenkins job.

# Developer instructions

Make sure you have Maven and JDK installed.

Run unit tests

```
mvn test

```

Run findbugs:

```
mvn findbugs:check

```

Create an HPI file to install in Jenkins (HPI file will be in `target/mattermost.hpi`).

```
mvn package

```

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |
