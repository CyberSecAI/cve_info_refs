Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10459:

**CVE-2019-10459**

*   **Root Cause:** The Mattermost Notification Plugin stored Mattermost webhook URLs in plain text within the Jenkins global configuration file (`jenkins.plugins.mattermost.MattermostNotifier.xml`) and job configuration files (`config.xml`). These URLs contained secret tokens as part of the URL.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Plaintext Storage of Secrets:** Webhook URLs containing secret tokens were not encrypted when stored in configuration files.
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:**  Users with "Extended Read" permissions for job configurations or direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system could view these secrets.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Exposure of the Mattermost webhook URLs could allow unauthorized users to send messages to the associated Mattermost channel.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File System Access:** An attacker with direct access to the Jenkins controller's file system could read the configuration files containing the plain text webhook URLs.
    *   **Jenkins UI Access:** An attacker with "Extended Read" permission for jobs could access the job `config.xml` files which contained the webhook URLs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   File system access to the Jenkins controller, or
    *   "Extended Read" permissions for Jenkins jobs.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory states that the plugin now stores these URLs encrypted.
* The issue is specific to the Mattermost Notification Plugin.
* The content provides a good amount of detail regarding the vulnerability, exceeding the basic CVE description.
