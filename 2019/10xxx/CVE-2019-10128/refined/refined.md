Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the EnterpriseDB Windows installer for PostgreSQL not properly setting the Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the PostgreSQL binary installation directory and the data directory. Instead of locking down permissions, the installer retains the inherited ACLs, which can be overly permissive.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper permission restrictions on the PostgreSQL installation and data directories.
*   **Permissive ACLs:** The installer does not clear or restrict the inherited ACLs, leaving the directories with potentially excessive access rights.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** A local attacker can read arbitrary files within the data directory, bypassing database-imposed read access limitations, which could lead to sensitive data exposure.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In specific non-default configurations, an attacker with both an unprivileged Windows account and an unprivileged PostgreSQL account can cause the PostgreSQL service account to execute arbitrary code, leading to a complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is primarily local, requiring the attacker to have access to the Windows machine where PostgreSQL is installed.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The attacker needs to have an unprivileged Windows user account, as well as an unprivileged PostgreSQL account in some scenarios.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Machine Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine where the vulnerable PostgreSQL installation resides.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires a local user account, and may also require an unprivileged PostgreSQL account.
*   **Specific Configurations:** For arbitrary code execution, a specific non-default configuration is required.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects all supported versions of PostgreSQL installed using the EnterpriseDB installer and possibly older versions.
*   The issue has been fixed in PostgreSQL versions 11.3, 10.8, 9.6.13, 9.5.17, and 9.4.22.
*   The fix involves setting proper permissions on the PostgreSQL binary and data directories for both new and existing installations.
*   Users who installed PostgreSQL using other methods are advised to manually check and restrict permissions on their PostgreSQL binary and data directories.
