Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10349:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Dependency Graph Viewer Plugin does not properly escape the Display Name value for jobs within Jenkins.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The lack of proper output escaping allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the job's display name. This script is then stored and executed when other users view the dependency graph.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the dependency graph. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the Jenkins interface
    - Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the victim user.
    - Access to sensitive information available within the Jenkins environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be able to configure the display name of a job.
- The crafted display name containing malicious JavaScript is stored within Jenkins.
- When another user accesses the Dependency Graph Viewer, the injected script is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have permissions to modify the display name of a job. This likely requires at least Item/Configure permission for a job.
-  The attacker does not necessarily need to have administrative privileges, as the vulnerability is triggered when other users view the dependency graph.
- The attack is not dependent on user interaction (other than a user viewing the dependency graph), meaning itâ€™s a stored XSS.
