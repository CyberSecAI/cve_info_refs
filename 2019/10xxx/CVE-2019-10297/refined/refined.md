Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-10297:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Sametime Plugin stores credentials in plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Credentials:** The plugin stores sensitive credentials without encryption in its global configuration file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Credentials:** Unauthorized users with access to the Jenkins controller's file system can view the plaintext credentials. This can lead to unauthorized access to the Sametime service using these credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker needs access to the Jenkins controller's file system to read the configuration file containing the plaintext credentials. This can be achieved via:
    -  Compromised Jenkins user accounts or through other vulnerabilities in the Jenkins system.
    -  Direct access to the Jenkins server's file system via an internal breach.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker requires either:
    - Access to the Jenkins controller's file system.
    -  Or potentially a Jenkins user with sufficient privileges to read the configuration files from the Jenkins controller (though this is not explicitly stated in the provided information and it is more likely file system access).
