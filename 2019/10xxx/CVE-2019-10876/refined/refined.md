{
  "cve": "CVE-2019-10876",
  "related": true,
  "summary": "Neutron openvswitch agent crashes due to creation of two security groups that both use the same remote security group, where the first group doesn't define a port range and the second one does (one is a subset of the other; specifying no port range is the same as a full port range).",
  "details": [
    "**Root cause:** The code never assumed that the conjunction ID might not be present in the set due to already being removed.",
    "**Vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in neutron-openvswitch-agent security group rules. By creating two security groups with separate/overlapping port ranges, an authenticated user may prevent neutron from being able to configure networks on any compute nodes where those security groups are present.",
    "**Attack vector:** Creating two security groups with separate/overlapping port ranges.",
    "**Impact:** Neutron openvswitch agent crashes.",
    "**Affected component:** neutron-openvswitch-agent security group rules",
    "**Affected deployments:** All neutron deployments utilizing neutron-openvswitch-agent are affected.",
    "**Affected versions:** >=11.0.0 <11.0.7, >=12.0.0 <12.0.6, >=13.0.0 <13.0.3"
