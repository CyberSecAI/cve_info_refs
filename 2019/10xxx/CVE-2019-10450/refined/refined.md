Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-10450:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ElasticBox CI Plugin stores the access token in plain text in the global `config.xml` configuration file on the Jenkins controller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information:** The plugin stores the access token without any encryption, making it easily readable if the file is accessed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality breach:** An attacker who gains access to the Jenkins controller's file system can read the access token. This token can then be used to perform actions against the ElasticBox service, potentially impacting the ElasticBox environment and possibly leading to further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File System Access:** An attacker needs to gain access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved through various means:
  - Compromising the Jenkins server itself.
  - Having unauthorized access to the server's file system through other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the Jenkins controller's file system. This could be achieved through local access, a compromised account with sufficient permissions, or another vulnerability that allows access to the underlying server.
- The attacker needs to be able to read the `config.xml` file where the access token is stored.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that no fix was available at the time of publication.
- The plugin has been marked as deprecated.
