Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-10763

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization within the `pimcore/pimcore` package, leading to SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks. Specifically, the `id`, `storeId`, `pageSize`, and `tables` parameters are vulnerable.
*   **Improper Input Sanitization:** The application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Leakage:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the database.
*   **Data Modification:** While the attacker does not have full control over the modification, data can be modified.
*   **Denial of Service:** The vulnerability can lead to a total loss of availability of the service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **Parameter Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability through crafted payloads in the `id`, `storeId`, `pageSize`, and `tables` parameters.
*   **Time-Based and Error-Based SQL Injection:** The vulnerability can be exploited through time-based and error-based SQL injection techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Limited Privileges:** The attacker needs to have "classes permission" in the application.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the application.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability is present in `pimcore/pimcore` versions prior to 6.3.0
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 6.3.0.
* The CVSS score is 6.7 (Medium) according to Snyk, with high confidentiality and availability impact and low integrity impact.
