| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1730824#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-07-17 19:06:35 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Jenkins versions weekly before 2.186 and LTS before 2.176.2. Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition. This path would be used to store the uploaded file on the Jenkins master, resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability. This vulnerability is the result of an incomplete fix for SECURITY-1074. File parameters that escape the base directory are no longer accepted and the build will fail.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1730824#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-07-17 19:06:39 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-07-17/>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1730824#c2)  Laura Pardo    2019-07-17 19:07:01 UTC  ``` Created jenkins tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1730827](show_bug.cgi?id=1730827 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-10352 jenkins: Arbitrary file write vulnerability using file parameter definitions (SECURITY-1424) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1730824#c5)  Sam Fowler    2019-07-18 07:25:13 UTC  ``` "Any security advisory related updates to Jenkins core or the plugins we include in the OpenShift Jenkins master image will only occur in the v3.11 and v4.x branches of this repository."  <https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/README.md#jenkins-security-advisories-the-master-image-from-this-repository-and-the-oc-binary>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1730824#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-15 13:28:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:2503 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2503](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2503)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1730824#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-15 14:47:03 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1730869#c0)  Laura Pardo    2019-07-17 19:15:14 UTC  ``` A vulnerability was found in Jenkins versions weekly before 2.186 and LTS before 2.176.2. Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views. These views are frequently comprised of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content. In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1730869#c1)  Laura Pardo    2019-07-17 19:15:19 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-07-17/#SECURITY-534>   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1730869#c2)  Laura Pardo    2019-07-17 19:19:17 UTC  ``` Created jenkins tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1730876](show_bug.cgi?id=1730876 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2019-10354 jenkins: Unauthorized view fragment access (SECURITY-534) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1730869#c5)  Sam Fowler    2019-07-18 07:25:08 UTC  ``` "Any security advisory related updates to Jenkins core or the plugins we include in the OpenShift Jenkins master image will only occur in the v3.11 and v4.x branches of this repository."  <https://github.com/openshift/jenkins/blob/master/README.md#jenkins-security-advisories-the-master-image-from-this-repository-and-the-oc-binary>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1730869#c6)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-15 13:28:53 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:2503 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2503](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2503)   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1730869#c7)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-15 14:47:05 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Jenkins Security

The Jenkins project takes security seriously.
We make every possible effort to ensure users can adequately secure their automation infrastructure.
To that end, we work with Jenkins core and plugin developers, as well as security researchers, to fix security vulnerabilities in Jenkins in a timely manner, and to improve the security of Jenkins in general.

Learn more about [Securing Jenkins](/doc/book/security/) in the Jenkins User Handbook.

## Security Advisories

Security advisories are the primary way to publicly inform Jenkins users about security issues in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins.
You can find all past security advisories in our [security advisories archive](/security/advisories/).

We announce the publication of a new security advisory through multiple channels:

* We send an email notification to the public [`jenkinsci-advisories`](https://groups.google.com/g/jenkinsci-advisories) Google group with a short overview of affected components and a link to the security advisory. Only Jenkins security team members can post. You can subscribe and unsubscribe via email.
* We send an email notification to the [`oss-security`](https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/oss-security) mailing list with excerpts of the security advisory.
* We publish an [RSS feed for the jenkins.io/security/advisories/](/security/advisories/rss.xml) page.

Additionally, Jenkins administrators are informed about published security issues directly in Jenkins if they have affected versions of Jenkins or plugins installed.

Finally, the Jenkins project is a [CVE Numbers Authority](/security/cna), and we submit CVE metadata simultaneously with the publication of security advisories, allowing automated security tools using CVE information to identify vulnerable installations.

|  | Even if you run Jenkins on a private network and trust everyone in your team, security issues in Jenkins can still impact you:   * [CSRF vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) are a risk even if attackers have no direct access to Jenkins. * Does Jenkins build source code you haven’t audited, using build scripts someone else wrote, displaying generated reports on its web UI?   All of these are potential security concerns. |

## How to Report a Security Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability in Jenkins, please [report it in the issue tracker under the SECURITY project](https://issues.jenkins.io/secure/CreateIssueDetails%21init.jspa?pid=10180&issuetype=10103).
This project is configured in such a way that only the reporter, the maintainers, and the Jenkins security team can see the details.
Restricting access to this potentially sensitive information allows core and plugin maintainers to develop effective security fixes that are safe to apply.
We provide issue reporting guidelines and an overview of our process on [Reporting Security Vulnerabilities](reporting).

If you are unable to report using our issue tracker, you can also send your report to the private Jenkins Security Team mailing list:
`jenkinsci-cert@googlegroups.com`

|  | Do not contact the Jenkins security team asking us for compliance documents, certifications, or to fill out a questionnaire. We will not respond to such queries. If we consider it necessary to provide a statement in response to incidents such as [log4shell](/blog/2021/12/10/log4j2-rce-CVE-2021-44228/) or [SpringShell](/blog/2022/03/31/spring-rce-CVE-2022-22965/), you will find a response in our [blog](/blog/). |

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2018-10-10

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* Jenkins (core)

## Descriptions

### Path traversal vulnerability in Stapler allowed accessing internal data

**SECURITY-867
/
CVE-2018-1000997**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

A path traversal vulnerability in Stapler allowed viewing routable objects with views defined on any type.
This could be used to access internal data of routable objects, commonly by showing their string representation (`#toString()`).

### Arbitrary file write vulnerability using file parameter definitions

**SECURITY-1074
/
CVE-2018-1000406**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

**Description:**

Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition.
This path would be used to archive the uploaded file on the Jenkins controller, resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability.

File parameters that escape the base directory are no longer accepted and the build will fail.

### Reflected XSS vulnerability

**SECURITY-1129
/
CVE-2018-1000407**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

The `wrapper` query parameter for the XML variant of the Jenkins remote API did not validate the specified tag name.
This resulted in a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability.

Only legal XML tag names are now allowed for the `wrapper` query parameter.

### Ephemeral user record was created on some invalid authentication attempts

**SECURITY-1162
/
CVE-2018-1999043**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Description:**

When attempting to authenticate using API token, an ephemeral user record was created to validate the token in case an external security realm was used, and the user record in Jenkins not previously saved, as (legacy) API tokens could exist without a persisted user record.

This behavior could be abused to create a large number of ephemeral user records in memory.

This is the same vulnerability as [SECURITY-672](/security/advisory/2018-08-15/#SECURITY-672).
The fix for SECURITY-672 was previously incorrectly applied and therefore not effective.
This has been fixed.

### Ephemeral user record creation

**SECURITY-1128
/
CVE-2018-1000408**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L)

**Description:**

By accessing a specific crafted URL on Jenkins instances using *Jenkins' own user database*, users without Overall/Read access could create ephemeral user records.

This behavior could be abused to create a large number of ephemeral user records in memory.

Accessing this URL now no longer results in a user record getting created.

### Session fixation vulnerability on user signup

**SECURITY-1158
/
CVE-2018-1000409**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Description:**

When signing up for a new user account on instances using *Jenkins' own user database*, Jenkins did not invalidate the existing session and create a new one.
This allowed session fixation.

Jenkins now invalidates the existing session and creates a new one when logging in after user signup.

### Failures to process form submission data could result in secrets being displayed or written to logs

**SECURITY-765
/
CVE-2018-1000410**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

When Jenkins fails to process form submissions due to an internal error, the error message shown to the user and written to the log typically includes the serialized JSON form submission.
Secrets, such as submitted passwords, might be included with the JSON object, and shown or written to disk in plain text.

Jenkins now masks values in these error messages from view if they were shown on the UI as password form fields.

## Severity

# Jenkins Security Advisory 2019-07-17

This advisory announces vulnerabilities in the following Jenkins deliverables:

* Jenkins (core)

## Descriptions

### Arbitrary file write vulnerability using file parameter definitions

**SECURITY-1424
/
CVE-2019-10352**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N)

**Description:**

Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition.
This path would be used to store the uploaded file on the Jenkins controller, resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability.

File parameters that escape the base directory are no longer accepted and the build will fail.

This vulnerability is the result of an incomplete fix for [SECURITY-1074](/security/advisory/2018-10-10/#SECURITY-1074).

### CSRF protection tokens did not expire

**SECURITY-626
/
CVE-2019-10353**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:L)

**Description:**

By default, CSRF tokens in Jenkins only checked user authentication and IP address.
This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token for another user to implement CSRF attacks as long as the victim’s IP address remained unchanged.

CSRF tokens will now also check the web session ID to confirm they were created in the same session.
Once that’s invalidated or expired, corresponding CSRF tokens will become invalid as well.

|  | This fix may impact scripts that obtain a crumb from the crumb issuer API. They may need to be updated to retain the session ID for subsequent requests. For further information, see the [LTS upgrade guide](/doc/upgrade-guide/2.176/#SECURITY-626). |
| --- | --- |

We also publish the [Strict Crumb Issuer Plugin](https://plugins.jenkins.io/strict-crumb-issuer) which contains additional protection mechanisms that give administrators more fine-grained control over the validity of CSRF tokens.
We plan to improve the built-in default crumb issuer based on user feedback of this implementation.

### Unauthorized view fragment access

**SECURITY-534
/
CVE-2019-10354**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Description:**

Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views.
These views are frequently composed of several view fragments, enabling plugins to extend existing views with more content.

In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding view.

The Stapler web framework has been extended with a Service Provider Interface (SPI) that allows preventing views from being rendered.
The implementation of that SPI in Jenkins now prevents view fragments from being rendered.
Further details are available in the [developer documentation](/doc/developer/views/SECURITY-534).

Most views in Jenkins and Jenkins plugins should be compatible with this change.
We track known affected plugins and their status in [the Jenkins wiki](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Plugins%2Baffected%2Bby%2Bthe%2BSECURITY-534%2Bfix).

In rare cases, it may be desirable to disable this fix.
To do so, set the Java system property `jenkins.security.stapler.StaplerDispatchValidator.disabled` to `true`.

SECURITY-1424 / CVE-2019-10352
Users with Job/Configure permission could specify a relative path escaping
the base directory in the file name portion of a file parameter definition.

This path would be used to store the uploaded file on the Jenkins master,
resulting in an arbitrary file write vulnerability.

SECURITY-626 / CVE-2019-10353
By default, CSRF tokens in Jenkins only checked user authentication and IP
address.

This allowed attackers able to obtain a CSRF token for another user to
implement CSRF attacks as long as the victim's IP address remained unchanged.

SECURITY-534 / CVE-2019-10354
Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework to render its UI views.

These views are frequently comprised of several view fragments, enabling
plugins to extend existing views with more content.

In some cases attackers could directly access a view fragment containing
sensitive information, bypassing any permission checks in the corresponding
view.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

# Jenkins Path Traversal / Arbitrary File Write

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable discovered that the patch for CVE-2018-1000406 ([SECURITY-1074](https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2018-10-10/#SECURITY-1074)) is inadequate.
#### CVE-2019-10352: Path Traversal Arbitrary File Write

A path traversal vulnerability exists in core/src/main/java/hudson/model/FileParameterValue.java that allows authenticated attackers with Job/Configure permission to define a file parameter with a file name outside the intended directory, resulting in an arbitrary file write on the Jenkins master when scheduling a build.

##### Proof of Concept

Below is a series of instructions to follow in order to reproduce the vulnerability:

1. Download Jenkins latest weekly from http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war/latest/jenkins.war. At the time of this writing, this is 2.180.
2. Start Jenkins (java -jar jenkins.war) and browse to http://<server>:8080/
3. Follow the on screen instructions to begin using Jenkins (initialAdminPW, default plugins etc.).
4. Create a user and give them overall read and job build, configure & read permissions.
5. Create a new "Freestyle Project" named test (the workspace for this project will be located at JENKINS\_HOME/workspace/test)
6. Log out of admin user and in as the restricted permission user created above.
7. Select the project and click configure on the left.
8. Tick the "This build is parameterised" box and select File Parameter.
9. For the file location enter: 'dir/../../../pwned' and click save.
10. Click build with parameters and select the file you wish to upload.
11. With the path supplied above, the file will be written to the JENKINS\_HOME/workspace directory (it is the intended behaviour that it should only be permitted to be written under the project workspace - in this case JENKINS\_HOME/workspace/test). However, it may be written to anywhere on the filesystem that the user running Jenkins has permission to write.

The original fix disallowed absolute / relative paths. However, the above path bypasses their validation.

### Solution

Upgrade to Jenkins 2.186.
