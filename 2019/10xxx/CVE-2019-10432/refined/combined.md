Subject: Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins

Jenkins is an open source automation server which enables developers around
the world to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. The following
releases contain fixes for security vulnerabilities:

* HTML Publisher Plugin 1.21
* Script Security Plugin 1.65

Additionally, we announce unresolved security issues in the following
plugins:

* Dingding[钉钉] Plugin
* LDAP Email
* SourceGear Vault

Summaries of the vulnerabilities are below. More details, severity, and
attribution can be found here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-10-01/>

We provide advance notification for security updates on this mailing list:
<https://groups.google.com/d/forum/jenkinsci-advisories>

If you discover security vulnerabilities in Jenkins, please report them as
described here:
<https://jenkins.io/security/#reporting-vulnerabilities>

---

SECURITY-1579 / CVE-2019-10431
Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through
default parameter expressions in constructors.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to
execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins master JVM.

SECURITY-1590 / CVE-2019-10432
HTML Publisher Plugin did not escape the project or build display name
shown in the frame HTML page. This resulted in a cross-site scripting
vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the project or
build display name, typically users with Job/Configure or Build/Update
permission.

SECURITY-1423 / CVE-2019-10433
Dingding[钉钉] Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in job config.xml
files on the Jenkins master. This token can be viewed by users with
Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1515 / CVE-2019-10434
LDAP Email Plugin stores an LDAP bind password in its global Jenkins
configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

SECURITY-1524 / CVE-2019-10435
SourceGear Vault Plugin stores an SCM password in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain
text as part of the configuration form. This can result in exposure of the
password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities,
and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## Descriptions

### Sandbox bypass vulnerability in Script Security Plugin

**SECURITY-1579
/
CVE-2019-10431**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[High](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

**Affected plugin:
[`script-security`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/script-security)**

**Description:**

Sandbox protection in Script Security Plugin could be circumvented through default parameter expressions in constructors.

This allowed attackers able to specify and run sandboxed scripts to execute arbitrary code in the context of the Jenkins controller JVM.

These expressions are now subject to sandbox protection.

### Stored XSS vulnerability in HTML Publisher Plugin

**SECURITY-1590
/
CVE-2019-10432**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Medium](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`htmlpublisher`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/htmlpublisher)**

**Description:**

HTML Publisher Plugin did not escape the project or build display name shown in the frame HTML page.
This resulted in a cross-site scripting vulnerability exploitable by attackers able to control the project or build display name, typically users with Job/Configure or Build/Update permission.

HTML Publisher Plugin now escapes the display name displayed in the frame HTML page.

### DingTalk Plugin stores credentials in plain text

**SECURITY-1423
/
CVE-2019-10433**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`dingding-notifications`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/dingding-notifications)**

**Description:**

DingTalk Plugin stores an access token unencrypted in job `config.xml` files on the Jenkins controller.
This token can be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the Jenkins controller file system.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### LDAP Email Plugin shows plain text password in configuration form

**SECURITY-1515
/
CVE-2019-10434**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`ldapemail`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/ldapemail)**

**Description:**

LDAP Email Plugin stores an LDAP bind password in its global Jenkins configuration.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

### SourceGear Vault Plugin shows plain text password in configuration form

**SECURITY-1524
/
CVE-2019-10435**

**Severity (CVSS):**
[Low](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Affected plugin:
[`vault-scm-plugin`](https://plugins.jenkins.io/vault-scm-plugin)**

**Description:**

SourceGear Vault Plugin stores an SCM password in job configurations.

While the password is stored encrypted on disk, it is transmitted in plain text as part of the configuration form.
This can result in exposure of the password through browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar situations.

As of publication of this advisory, there is no fix.

## About this plugin

The HTML Publisher plugin is useful to publish HTML reports that your build generates to the job and build pages. It is designed to work with both *Freestyle* projects as well as being used in a Jenkins *Pipeline*.

## Usage

### Installing and enabling the plugin

The HTML Publisher plugin can be installed from any Jenkins installation connected to the Internet using the **Plugin Manage** screen. Once installed, the plugin can be configured as part of your Jenkins *Freestyle* job, or used in a Jenkins *Pipeline*.

#### Using with Freestyle Jobs

The HTML Publisher plugin can be configured in the post build portion of your Jenkins job.

[![Configuration](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/htmlpublisher-plugin@master/docs/images/blankFreestyleConfig.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/htmlpublisher-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/blankFreestyleConfig.png)

* HTML directory to archive - the path to the report directory to archive relative to the workspace.
* Index page[s] - comma-seperated list of files that will be used as index pages. Ant patterns can be used.
* Index page title[s] (Optional) - optional title(s) for the index pages, which will be used as the tab names. If this is not provided, file names will be used instead.
* Report title - the name of the report.

Clicking *Publishing options...* will present you with some additional options:

[![Publishing Options](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/htmlpublisher-plugin@master/docs/images/publishingOptionsConfig.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/htmlpublisher-plugin/blob/master/docs/images/publishingOptionsConfig.png)

* Keep past HTML reports - whether to keep all archived reports or only the one from the last stable build.
* Always link to last build - whether to always link to the last build's report regardless of status or only to link to the last successful build's.
* Allow missing report - if `false`, build will be marked as failed if the report directory does not exist.
* Include files - Optional Ant pattern that specifies what files in the report directory to archive. Defaults to archiving all files in the given report directory.
* Escape underscores in Report Title - if `true`, underscores in report titles will be escaped to `_5F` along with other non-alphanumeric characters. If `false` they will be left as is.

#### Using with Pipeline Jobs

The HTML Publisher plugin can also be used as part of a Jenkins Pipeline. All you need to do is reference the `publishHTML` step in your pipeline. e.g.

```
publishHTML (target : [allowMissing: false,
 alwaysLinkToLastBuild: true,
 keepAll: true,
 reportDir: 'reports',
 reportFiles: 'myreport.html',
 reportName: 'My Reports',
 reportTitles: 'The Report'])
```

See <https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/htmlpublisher/> for a reference of available step parameters.

To assist in the creation of the pipeline step, you can use the Snippet Generator and generate the required code. The Snippet Generator can be found at `<JENKINS-URL>/pipeline-syntax/`

[![](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jenkinsci/htmlpublisher-plugin@master/docs/images/Pipeline_Syntax_Snippet_Generator.png)](https://github.com/jenkinsci/htmlpublisher-plugin/blob/master/./docs/images/Pipeline_Syntax_Snippet_Generator.png)

#### Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble viewing the published HTML reports, check your browser console to see if there are any errors about Content Security Policy. This is often a culprit. If see errors, review [https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring+Content+Security+Policy](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Configuring%2BContent%2BSecurity%2BPolicy) for instructions on how to resolve.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.
