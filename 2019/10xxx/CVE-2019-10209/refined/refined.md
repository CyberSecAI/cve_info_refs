  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Memory disclosure in cross-type comparison for hashed subplan.",
    "weaknesses": "The vulnerability lies in how PostgreSQL handles cross-type comparisons within hashed subplans when user-defined hash equality operators are present.",
    "impact": "An attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack requires a superuser to create specific, unusual hash equality operators. After that, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability by triggering cross-type comparisons in a subplan that uses a user-defined hash equality operator.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Requires a superuser to create specific, unusual hash equality operators. A low-privileged attacker can then trigger the vulnerability.",
