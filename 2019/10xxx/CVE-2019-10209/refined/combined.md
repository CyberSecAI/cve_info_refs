# PostgreSQL 11.5, 10.10, 9.6.15, 9.5.19, 9.4.24, and 12 Beta 3 Released!

Posted on **2019-08-08** by PostgreSQL Global Development Group
 PostgreSQL Project
 Security

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has released an update to all supported
versions of our database system, including 11.5, 10.10, 9.6.15, 9.5.19, and
9.4.24, as well as the third beta of PostgreSQL 12. This release fixes two
security issues in the PostgreSQL server, two security issues found in one of
the PostgreSQL Windows installers, and over 40 bugs reported since the previous
release.

Users should install these updates as soon as possible.

## A Note on the PostgreSQL 12 Beta

In the spirit of the open source PostgreSQL community, we strongly encourage you
to test the new features of PostgreSQL 12 in your database systems to help us
eliminate any bugs or other issues that may exist. While we do not advise you to
run PostgreSQL 12 Beta 3 in your production environments, we encourage you to
find ways to run your typical application workloads against this beta release.

Your testing and feedback will help the community ensure that the PostgreSQL 12
release upholds our standards of providing a stable, reliable release of the
world's most advanced open source relational database.

## Security Issues

Four security vulnerabilities have been closed by this release:

### [CVE-2019-10208](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2019-10208): `TYPE` in `pg_temp` executes arbitrary SQL during `SECURITY DEFINER` execution

Versions Affected: 9.4 - 11

Given a suitable `SECURITY DEFINER` function, an attacker can execute arbitrary
SQL under the identity of the function owner. An attack requires `EXECUTE`
permission on the function, which must itself contain a function call having
inexact argument type match. For example, `length('foo'::varchar)` and
`length('foo')` are inexact, while `length('foo'::text)` is exact. As part of
exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker uses `CREATE DOMAIN` to create a
type in a `pg_temp` schema. The attack pattern and fix are similar to that for
[CVE-2007-2138](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2007-2138).

Writing `SECURITY DEFINER` functions continues to require

following the considerations noted in the documentation:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html#SQL-CREATEFUNCTION-SECURITY>

The PostgreSQL project thanks Tom Lane for reporting this problem.

### [CVE-2019-10209](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2019-10209): Memory disclosure in cross-type comparison for hashed subplan

Versions Affected: 11

In a database containing hypothetical, user-defined hash equality operators,
an attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory. For an attack to
become possible, a superuser would need to create unusual operators. It is
possible for operators not purpose-crafted for attack to have the properties
that enable an attack, but we are not aware of specific examples.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Andreas Seltenreich for reporting this problem.

### [CVE-2019-10210](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2019-10210/): EnterpriseDB Windows installer writes PostgreSQL superuser password to unprotected temporary file

Versions Affected: The EnterpriseDB Windows installer for versions 9.4 - 11

The EnterpriseDB Windows installer writes a password to a temporary file in its
installation directory, creates initial databases, and deletes the file. During
those seconds while the file exists, a local attacker can read the PostgreSQL
superuser password from the file.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Noah Misch for reporting this problem.

### [CVE-2019-10211](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2019-10211/): EnterpriseDB Windows installer bundled OpenSSL executes code from unprotected directory

Versions Affected: The EnterpriseDB Windows installer for versions 9.4 - 11

When the database server or libpq client library initializes SSL, libeay32.dll
attempts to read configuration from a hard-coded directory. Typically, the
directory does not exist, but any local user could create it and inject
configuration. This configuration can direct OpenSSL to load and execute
arbitrary code as the user running a PostgreSQL server or client. Most
PostgreSQL client tools and libraries use libpq, and one can encounter this
vulnerability by using any of them. This vulnerability is much like
[CVE-2019-5443](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5443), but it originated
independently. One can work around the vulnerability by setting environment
variable OPENSSL\_CONF to "NUL:/openssl.cnf" or any other name that cannot exist
as a file.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Daniel Gustafsson of the curl security team for
reporting this problem.

## Bug Fixes and Improvements

This update also fixes over 40 bugs that were reported in the last several
months. Some of these issues affect only version 11, but many affect all
supported versions.

Some of these fixes include:

* Fix for `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE` when multiple column types are
  modified in a single-command. This issue was introduced in the previous
  cumulative update (11.4, 10.9, 9.6.14, 9.5.18, 9.4.23, and 12 beta 2).
* Ensure that partition key columns will not be dropped as the result of an
  "indirect drop," such as from a cascade from dropping the key column's data
  type (e.g. a custom data type). This fix is applied only to newly created
  partitioned tables: if you believe you have an affected partition table (e.g.
  one where the partition key uses a custom data type), you will need to either create a new table and move your data into it OR use `pg_upgrade`.
* Prevent dropping a partitioned table's trigger if there are pending trigger
  events in child partitions. This particularly affects foreign key constraints,
  which are implemented by triggers.
* Several additional fixes for partitioning, including a fix for partition
  pruning that could lead to inefficient queries.
* Fix for parallel hash joins that could lead to duplicate result rows in
  `EXISTS` queries.
* Several fixes for the query planner.
* Several fixes for issues that would lead to query deadlocks.
* Fix for multi-column foreign keys when rebuilding a foreign key constraint.
* Prevent extended statistics from being built for inherited tables.
* Fix for the canonicalization of date ranges that include `-infinity`/`infinity`
  endpoints to ensure the behavior matches the documentation.
* Fix loss of fractional digits when converting very large `money` values to
  `numeric`.
* Fix for PL/pgSQL functions that return composite types.
* Make libpq ignore the `\r` carriage return in connection service files, which
  was causing connection failures in some edge cases.
* Several fixes for `psql`, which includes avoiding incorrect tab completion
  options after `SET variable =`.
* Improve reliability of `contrib/amcheck`'s index verification.
* Set `initdb` to prefer the timezone behavior defined by the C library instead
  of what is defined by `localtime` or `posixrules`. This ensures PostgreSQL uses
  the "real" timezone name instead of an artificial name.
* Fix `pg_dump` to ensure that custom operator classes are dumped in the correct
  order to prevent creating an unrestorable dump.
* Fix possible lockup in `pgbench` when using -R option.
* Fix spinlock assembly code for MIPS CPUs so that it works on MIPS r6.

This update also contains tzdata release 2019b for DST law changes in Brazil,
plus historical corrections for Hong Kong, Italy, and Palestine. This update
also adds support for zic's new -b slim option to reduce the size of the
installed zone files, though it is not currently being used by PostgreSQL.

For more details, you can read the full copy of the release notes here:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/>

## Updating

All PostgreSQL update releases are cumulative. As with other minor releases,
users are not required to dump and reload their database or use `pg_upgrade` in
order to apply this update release; you may simply shutdown PostgreSQL and
update its binaries.

Users who have skipped one or more update releases may need to run additional,
post-update steps; please see the release notes for earlier versions for
details.

PostgreSQL 9.4 will stop receiving fixes on February 13, 2020. Please see our
[versioning policy](https://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) for more
information.

## Testing for Bugs & Compatibility

The stability of each PostgreSQL release greatly depends on you, the community,
to test the upcoming version with your workloads and testing tools in order to
find bugs and regressions before the general availability of PostgreSQL 12. As
this is a Beta, minor changes to database behaviors, feature details, and APIs
are still possible. Your feedback and testing will help determine the final
tweaks on the new features, so please test in the near future. The quality of
user testing helps determine when we can make a final release.

A list of [open issues](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_12_Open_Items)
is publicly available in the PostgreSQL wiki. You can
[report bugs](https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/) using this form on
the PostgreSQL website:

https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/

## Beta Schedule

This is the third beta release of version 12. The PostgreSQL Project will
release additional betas as required for testing, followed by one or more
release candidates, until the final release in late 2019. For further
information please see the [Beta Testing](https://www.postgresql.org/developer/beta/) page.

## Description

`CREATE FUNCTION` defines a new function. `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` will either create a new function, or replace an existing definition. To be able to define a function, the user must have the `USAGE` privilege on the language.

If a schema name is included, then the function is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. The name of the new function must not match any existing function or procedure with the same input argument types in the same schema. However, functions and procedures of different argument types can share a name (this is called *overloading*).

To replace the current definition of an existing function, use `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`. It is not possible to change the name or argument types of a function this way (if you tried, you would actually be creating a new, distinct function). Also, `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` will not let you change the return type of an existing function. To do that, you must drop and recreate the function. (When using `OUT` parameters, that means you cannot change the types of any `OUT` parameters except by dropping the function.)

When `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` is used to replace an existing function, the ownership and permissions of the function do not change. All other function properties are assigned the values specified or implied in the command. You must own the function to replace it (this includes being a member of the owning role).

If you drop and then recreate a function, the new function is not the same entity as the old; you will have to drop existing rules, views, triggers, etc. that refer to the old function. Use `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` to change a function definition without breaking objects that refer to the function. Also, `ALTER FUNCTION` can be used to change most of the auxiliary properties of an existing function.

The user that creates the function becomes the owner of the function.

To be able to create a function, you must have `USAGE` privilege on the argument types and the return type.

Refer to [Section 36.3](xfunc.html "36.3. User-Defined Functions") for further information on writing functions.

## Parameters

*`name`*

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the function to create.

*`argmode`*

The mode of an argument: `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`. Only `OUT` arguments can follow a `VARIADIC` one. Also, `OUT` and `INOUT` arguments cannot be used together with the `RETURNS TABLE` notation.

*`argname`*

The name of an argument. Some languages (including SQL and PL/pgSQL) let you use the name in the function body. For other languages the name of an input argument is just extra documentation, so far as the function itself is concerned; but you can use input argument names when calling a function to improve readability (see [Section 4.3](sql-syntax-calling-funcs.html "4.3. Calling Functions")). In any case, the name of an output argument is significant, because it defines the column name in the result row type. (If you omit the name for an output argument, the system will choose a default column name.)

*`argtype`*

The data type(s) of the function's arguments (optionally schema-qualified), if any. The argument types can be base, composite, or domain types, or can reference the type of a table column.

Depending on the implementation language it might also be allowed to specify “pseudo-types” such as `cstring`. Pseudo-types indicate that the actual argument type is either incompletely specified, or outside the set of ordinary SQL data types.

The type of a column is referenced by writing `table_name.column_name%TYPE`. Using this feature can sometimes help make a function independent of changes to the definition of a table.

*`default_expr`*

An expression to be used as default value if the parameter is not specified. The expression has to be coercible to the argument type of the parameter. Only input (including `INOUT`) parameters can have a default value. All input parameters following a parameter with a default value must have default values as well.

*`rettype`*

The return data type (optionally schema-qualified). The return type can be a base, composite, or domain type, or can reference the type of a table column. Depending on the implementation language it might also be allowed to specify “pseudo-types” such as `cstring`. If the function is not supposed to return a value, specify `void` as the return type.

When there are `OUT` or `INOUT` parameters, the `RETURNS` clause can be omitted. If present, it must agree with the result type implied by the output parameters: `RECORD` if there are multiple output parameters, or the same type as the single output parameter.

The `SETOF` modifier indicates that the function will return a set of items, rather than a single item.

The type of a column is referenced by writing `table_name.column_name%TYPE`.

*`column_name`*

The name of an output column in the `RETURNS TABLE` syntax. This is effectively another way of declaring a named `OUT` parameter, except that `RETURNS TABLE` also implies `RETURNS SETOF`.

*`column_type`*

The data type of an output column in the `RETURNS TABLE` syntax.

*`lang_name`*

The name of the language that the function is implemented in. It can be `sql`, `c`, `internal`, or the name of a user-defined procedural language, e.g., `plpgsql`. The default is `sql` if *`sql_body`* is specified. Enclosing the name in single quotes is deprecated and requires matching case.

`TRANSFORM { FOR TYPE type_name } [, ... ] }`

Lists which transforms a call to the function should apply. Transforms convert between SQL types and language-specific data types; see [CREATE TRANSFORM](sql-createtransform.html "CREATE TRANSFORM"). Procedural language implementations usually have hardcoded knowledge of the built-in types, so those don't need to be listed here. If a procedural language implementation does not know how to handle a type and no transform is supplied, it will fall back to a default behavior for converting data types, but this depends on the implementation.

`WINDOW`

`WINDOW` indicates that the function is a *window function* rather than a plain function. This is currently only useful for functions written in C. The `WINDOW` attribute cannot be changed when replacing an existing function definition.

`IMMUTABLE`
`STABLE`
`VOLATILE`

These attributes inform the query optimizer about the behavior of the function. At most one choice can be specified. If none of these appear, `VOLATILE` is the default assumption.

`IMMUTABLE` indicates that the function cannot modify the database and always returns the same result when given the same argument values; that is, it does not do database lookups or otherwise use information not directly present in its argument list. If this option is given, any call of the function with all-constant arguments can be immediately replaced with the function value.

`STABLE` indicates that the function cannot modify the database, and that within a single table scan it will consistently return the same result for the same argument values, but that its result could change across SQL statements. This is the appropriate selection for functions whose results depend on database lookups, parameter variables (such as the current time zone), etc. (It is inappropriate for `AFTER` triggers that wish to query rows modified by the current command.) Also note that the `current_timestamp` family of functions qualify as stable, since their values do not change within a transaction.

`VOLATILE` indicates that the function value can change even within a single table scan, so no optimizations can be made. Relatively few database functions are volatile in this sense; some examples are `random()`, `currval()`, `timeofday()`. But note that any function that has side-effects must be classified volatile, even if its result is quite predictable, to prevent calls from being optimized away; an example is `setval()`.

For additional details see [Section 36.7](xfunc-volatility.html "36.7. Function Volatility Categories").

`LEAKPROOF`

`LEAKPROOF` indicates that the function has no side effects. It reveals no information about its arguments other than by its return value. For example, a function which throws an error message for some argument values but not others, or which includes the argument values in any error message, is not leakproof. This affects how the system executes queries against views created with the `security_barrier` option or tables with row level security enabled. The system will enforce conditions from security policies and security barrier views before any user-supplied conditions from the query itself that contain non-leakproof functions, in order to prevent the inadvertent exposure of data. Functions and operators marked as leakproof are assumed to be trustworthy, and may be executed before conditions from security policies and security barrier views. In addition, functions which do not take arguments or which are not passed any arguments from the security barrier view or table do not have to be marked as leakproof to be executed before security conditions. See [CREATE VIEW](sql-createview.html "CREATE VIEW") and [Section 39.5](rules-privileges.html "39.5. Rules and Privileges"). This option can only be set by the superuser.

`CALLED ON NULL INPUT`
`RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT`
`STRICT`

`CALLED ON NULL INPUT` (the default) indicates that the function will be called normally when some of its arguments are null. It is then the function author's responsibility to check for null values if necessary and respond appropriately.

`RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT` or `STRICT` indicates that the function always returns null whenever any of its arguments are null. If this parameter is specified, the function is not executed when there are null arguments; instead a null result is assumed automatically.

`[EXTERNAL] SECURITY INVOKER`
`[EXTERNAL] SECURITY DEFINER`

`SECURITY INVOKER` indicates that the function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that calls it. That is the default. `SECURITY DEFINER` specifies that the function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that owns it. For information on how to write `SECURITY DEFINER` functions safely, [see below](sql-createfunction.html#SQL-CREATEFUNCTION-SECURITY "Writing SECURITY DEFINER Functions Safely").

The key word `EXTERNAL` is allowed for SQL conformance, but it is optional since, unlike in SQL, this feature applies to all functions not only external ones.

`PARALLEL`

`PARALLEL UNSAFE` indicates that the function can't be executed in parallel mode; the presence of such a function in an SQL statement forces a serial execution plan. This is the default. `PARALLEL RESTRICTED` indicates that the function can be executed in parallel mode, but only in the parallel group leader process. `PARALLEL SAFE` indicates that the function is safe to run in parallel mode without restriction, including in parallel worker processes.

Functions should be labeled parallel unsafe if they modify any database state, change the transaction state (other than by using a subtransaction for error recovery), access sequences (e.g., by calling `currval`) or make persistent changes to settings. They should be labeled parallel restricted if they access temporary tables, client connection state, cursors, prepared statements, or miscellaneous backend-local state which the system cannot synchronize in parallel mode (e.g., `setseed` cannot be executed other than by the group leader because a change made by another process would not be reflected in the leader). In general, if a function is labeled as being safe when it is restricted or unsafe, or if it is labeled as being restricted when it is in fact unsafe, it may throw errors or produce wrong answers when used in a parallel query. C-language functions could in theory exhibit totally undefined behavior if mislabeled, since there is no way for the system to protect itself against arbitrary C code, but in most likely cases the result will be no worse than for any other function. If in doubt, functions should be labeled as `UNSAFE`, which is the default.

`COST` *`execution_cost`*

A positive number giving the estimated execution cost for the function, in units of [cpu\_operator\_cost](runtime-config-query.html#GUC-CPU-OPERATOR-COST). If the function returns a set, this is the cost per returned row. If the cost is not specified, 1 unit is assumed for C-language and internal functions, and 100 units for functions in all other languages. Larger values cause the planner to try to avoid evaluating the function more often than necessary.

`ROWS` *`result_rows`*

A positive number giving the estimated number of rows that the planner should expect the function to return. This is only allowed when the function is declared to return a set. The default assumption is 1000 rows.

`SUPPORT` *`support_function`*

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a *planner support function* to use for this function. See [Section 36.11](xfunc-optimization.html "36.11. Function Optimization Information") for details. You must be superuser to use this option.

*`configuration_parameter`*
*`value`*

The `SET` clause causes the specified configuration parameter to be set to the specified value when the function is entered, and then restored to its prior value when the function exits. `SET FROM CURRENT` saves the value of the parameter that is current when `CREATE FUNCTION` is executed as the value to be applied when the function is entered.

If a `SET` clause is attached to a function, then the effects of a `SET LOCAL` command executed inside the function for the same variable are restricted to the function: the configuration parameter's prior value is still restored at function exit. However, an ordinary `SET` command (without `LOCAL`) overrides the `SET` clause, much as it would do for a previous `SET LOCAL` command: the effects of such a command will persist after function exit, unless the current transaction is rolled back.

See [SET](sql-set.html "SET") and [Chapter 19](runtime-config.html "Chapter 19. Server Configuration") for more information about allowed parameter names and values.

*`definition`*

A string constant defining the function; the meaning depends on the language. It can be an internal function name, the path to an object file, an SQL command, or text in a procedural language.

It is often helpful to use dollar quoting (see [Section 4.1.2.4](sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-DOLLAR-QUOTING "4.1.2.4. Dollar-Quoted String Constants")) to write the function definition string, rather than the normal single quote syntax. Without dollar quoting, any single quotes or backslashes in the function definition must be escaped by doubling them.

`obj_file, link_symbol`

This form of the `AS` clause is used for dynamically loadable C language functions when the function name in the C language source code is not the same as the name of the SQL function. The string *`obj_file`* is the name of the shared library file containing the compiled C function, and is interpreted as for the [`LOAD`](sql-load.html "LOAD") command. The string *`link_symbol`* is the function's link symbol, that is, the name of the function in the C language source code. If the link symbol is omitted, it is assumed to be the same as the name of the SQL function being defined. The C names of all functions must be different, so you must give overloaded C functions different C names (for example, use the argument types as part of the C names).

When repeated `CREATE FUNCTION` calls refer to the same object file, the file is only loaded once per session. To unload and reload the file (perhaps during development), start a new session.

*`sql_body`*

The body of a `LANGUAGE SQL` function. This can either be a single statement

```

RETURN expression

```

or a block

```

BEGIN ATOMIC
  statement;
  statement;
  ...
  statement;
END

```

This is similar to writing the text of the function body as a string constant (see *`definition`* above), but there are some differences: This form only works for `LANGUAGE SQL`, the string constant form works for all languages. This form is parsed at function definition time, the string constant form is parsed at execution time; therefore this form cannot support polymorphic argument types and other constructs that are not resolvable at function definition time. This form tracks dependencies between the function and objects used in the function body, so `DROP ... CASCADE` will work correctly, whereas the form using string literals may leave dangling functions. Finally, this form is more compatible with the SQL standard and other SQL implementations.

## Overloading

PostgreSQL allows function *overloading*; that is, the same name can be used for several different functions so long as they have distinct input argument types. Whether or not you use it, this capability entails security precautions when calling functions in databases where some users mistrust other users; see [Section 10.3](typeconv-func.html "10.3. Functions").

Two functions are considered the same if they have the same names and *input* argument types, ignoring any `OUT` parameters. Thus for example these declarations conflict:

```

CREATE FUNCTION foo(int) ...
CREATE FUNCTION foo(int, out text) ...

```

Functions that have different argument type lists will not be considered to conflict at creation time, but if defaults are provided they might conflict in use. For example, consider

```

CREATE FUNCTION foo(int) ...
CREATE FUNCTION foo(int, int default 42) ...

```

A call `foo(10)` will fail due to the ambiguity about which function should be called.

## Notes

The full SQL type syntax is allowed for declaring a function's arguments and return value. However, parenthesized type modifiers (e.g., the precision field for type `numeric`) are discarded by `CREATE FUNCTION`. Thus for example `CREATE FUNCTION foo (varchar(10)) ...` is exactly the same as `CREATE FUNCTION foo (varchar) ...`.

When replacing an existing function with `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`, there are restrictions on changing parameter names. You cannot change the name already assigned to any input parameter (although you can add names to parameters that had none before). If there is more than one output parameter, you cannot change the names of the output parameters, because that would change the column names of the anonymous composite type that describes the function's result. These restrictions are made to ensure that existing calls of the function do not stop working when it is replaced.

If a function is declared `STRICT` with a `VARIADIC` argument, the strictness check tests that the variadic array *as a whole* is non-null. The function will still be called if the array has null elements.

## Examples

Add two integers using an SQL function:

```

CREATE FUNCTION add(integer, integer) RETURNS integer
    AS 'select $1 + $2;'
    LANGUAGE SQL
    IMMUTABLE
    RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT;

```

The same function written in a more SQL-conforming style, using argument names and an unquoted body:

```

CREATE FUNCTION add(a integer, b integer) RETURNS integer
    LANGUAGE SQL
    IMMUTABLE
    RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT
    RETURN a + b;

```

Increment an integer, making use of an argument name, in PL/pgSQL:

```

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION increment(i integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
        BEGIN
                RETURN i + 1;
        END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

```

Return a record containing multiple output parameters:

```

CREATE FUNCTION dup(in int, out f1 int, out f2 text)
    AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
    LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM dup(42);

```

You can do the same thing more verbosely with an explicitly named composite type:

```

CREATE TYPE dup_result AS (f1 int, f2 text);

CREATE FUNCTION dup(int) RETURNS dup_result
    AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
    LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM dup(42);

```

Another way to return multiple columns is to use a `TABLE` function:

```

CREATE FUNCTION dup(int) RETURNS TABLE(f1 int, f2 text)
    AS $$ SELECT $1, CAST($1 AS text) || ' is text' $$
    LANGUAGE SQL;

SELECT * FROM dup(42);

```

However, a `TABLE` function is different from the preceding examples, because it actually returns a *set* of records, not just one record.

## Writing `SECURITY DEFINER` Functions Safely

Because a `SECURITY DEFINER` function is executed with the privileges of the user that owns it, care is needed to ensure that the function cannot be misused. For security, [search\_path](runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SEARCH-PATH) should be set to exclude any schemas writable by untrusted users. This prevents malicious users from creating objects (e.g., tables, functions, and operators) that mask objects intended to be used by the function. Particularly important in this regard is the temporary-table schema, which is searched first by default, and is normally writable by anyone. A secure arrangement can be obtained by forcing the temporary schema to be searched last. To do this, write `pg_temp` as the last entry in `search_path`. This function illustrates safe usage:

```

CREATE FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
DECLARE passed BOOLEAN;
BEGIN
        SELECT  (pwd = $2) INTO passed
        FROM    pwds
        WHERE   username = $1;

        RETURN passed;
END;
$$  LANGUAGE plpgsql
    SECURITY DEFINER
    -- Set a secure search_path: trusted schema(s), then 'pg_temp'.
    SET search_path = admin, pg_temp;

```

This function's intention is to access a table `admin.pwds`. But without the `SET` clause, or with a `SET` clause mentioning only `admin`, the function could be subverted by creating a temporary table named `pwds`.

If the security definer function intends to create roles, and if it is running as a non-superuser, `createrole_self_grant` should also be set to a known value using the `SET` clause.

Another point to keep in mind is that by default, execute privilege is granted to `PUBLIC` for newly created functions (see [Section 5.8](ddl-priv.html "5.8. Privileges") for more information). Frequently you will wish to restrict use of a security definer function to only some users. To do that, you must revoke the default `PUBLIC` privileges and then grant execute privilege selectively. To avoid having a window where the new function is accessible to all, create it and set the privileges within a single transaction. For example:

```

BEGIN;
CREATE FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT) ... SECURITY DEFINER;
REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT) FROM PUBLIC;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION check_password(uname TEXT, pass TEXT) TO admins;
COMMIT;

```

## Compatibility

A `CREATE FUNCTION` command is defined in the SQL standard. The PostgreSQL implementation can be used in a compatible way but has many extensions. Conversely, the SQL standard specifies a number of optional features that are not implemented in PostgreSQL.

The following are important compatibility issues:

* `OR REPLACE` is a PostgreSQL extension.
* For compatibility with some other database systems, *`argmode`* can be written either before or after *`argname`*. But only the first way is standard-compliant.
* For parameter defaults, the SQL standard specifies only the syntax with the `DEFAULT` key word. The syntax with `=` is used in T-SQL and Firebird.
* The `SETOF` modifier is a PostgreSQL extension.
* Only `SQL` is standardized as a language.
* All other attributes except `CALLED ON NULL INPUT` and `RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT` are not standardized.
* For the body of `LANGUAGE SQL` functions, the SQL standard only specifies the *`sql_body`* form.

Simple `LANGUAGE SQL` functions can be written in a way that is both standard-conforming and portable to other implementations. More complex functions using advanced features, optimization attributes, or other languages will necessarily be specific to PostgreSQL in a significant way.

# CVE-2019-10209

### Memory disclosure in cross-type comparison for hashed subplan

In a database containing hypothetical, user-defined hash equality operators, an attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory. For an attack to become possible, a superuser would need to create unusual operators. It is possible for operators not purpose-crafted for attack to have the properties that enable an attack, but we are not aware of specific examples.

The PostgreSQL project thanks Andreas Seltenreich for reporting this problem.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c0)  msiddiqu    2019-07-30 14:42:46 UTC  ```  In a database containing hypothetical, user-defined hash equality operators, an attacker could read arbitrary bytes of server memory.  For an attack to become possible, a superuser would need to create unusual operators.  It is possible for operators not purpose-crafted for attack to have the properties that enable an attack, but we are not aware of specific examples.   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c3)  Joshua Padman    2019-07-31 05:10:28 UTC  ``` The following products only contain the JBDC postgresql driver, not the server and are not affected: * Red Hat Decision Manager * Red Hat Process Automation Manager   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c4)  msiddiqu    2019-08-07 11:56:54 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the PostgreSQL project Upstream: Andreas Seltenreich   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c7)  msiddiqu    2019-08-08 18:40:01 UTC  ``` Created postgresql tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1739212](show_bug.cgi?id=1739212 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-10209 postgresql: Memory disclosure in cross-type comparison for hashed subplan [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c8)  msiddiqu    2019-08-09 09:43:30 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1960/>   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c9)  Trupti Pardeshi    2019-08-13 11:10:01 UTC  ``` Hello,  May I know if Linux PostgreSQL 7.1beta6 version is also affected and requires this fix?

Older versions are safe from that vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c12)  Trupti Pardeshi    2019-08-13 12:22:49 UTC  ``` (In reply to Cedric Buissart 🐶 from [comment #11](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c11)) > In reply to [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1734447#c9): > > May I know if Linux PostgreSQL 7.1beta6 version is also affected and > > requires this fix?
