Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-11609:

**CVE-2019-11609:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Sensitive information disclosure.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the `movefile.php` file of the `fileman` component. The script lacks proper permission verification and fails to sanitize the `$newpath` variable when renaming the file. Specifically, the script allows moving of files to arbitrary locations due to the lack of filtering on the `$newpath` parameter.
*  **Weakness:** Improper input validation/sanitization, lack of access controls.
*   **Impact:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to move arbitrary files on the server, leading to potential information disclosure if sensitive files are moved to a publicly accessible location. Moreover, moving essential files (such as configuration files) can render the server unserviceable.
*   **Attack Vector:** A remote attacker sends a POST request to `/fileman/php/movefile.php` with the `f` parameter specifying the original location of the file and the `n` parameter specifying the new location, using directory traversal to move files to arbitrary paths.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server. No authentication is required.

**Technical Details:**

The provided exploit example demonstrates how to move the `/config/config.php` file to `/fileman/Uploads/test1.html` using the following POST request:
```
POST /fileman/php/movefile.php HTTP/1.1

f=%2Ffileman%2FUploads%2F..%2F..%2Fconfig%2Fconfig.php&n=%2Ffileman%2FUploads%2Ftest1.html
```
The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `f` and `n` parameters, specifically using `..` to traverse the directory structure and move the `/config/config.php` file to an arbitrary path (in this case, `/fileman/Uploads/test1.html`).

This action results in the file being accessible at `http://domain.com/fileman/Uploads/test1.html`, potentially leaking sensitive information. Additionally, the website becomes non-functional due to the missing configuration file.
