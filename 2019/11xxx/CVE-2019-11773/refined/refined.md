Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11773:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of unused RPATHs (Run-time search paths) in the AIX builds of Eclipse OMR (OpenJ9). These RPATHs point to library locations specified during the build process using '-L' flags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The build process for AIX resulted in shared libraries containing RPATHs that included more than just the default library paths.
- **Information Exposure:** The RPATHs embedded in the shared libraries could reveal system information about where the library was built.
- **Potential Code Injection/Privilege Elevation:** The presence of these non-standard RPATHs could be leveraged by local users to inject malicious code or elevate privileges by manipulating the library loading process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform code injection or privilege escalation.
- This would allow the attacker to potentially gain unauthorized access to system resources or execute arbitrary code on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system on which the vulnerable software is installed.
- **RPATH Manipulation:** The attacker would need to exploit the insecure RPATHs to control which libraries are loaded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local user account:** The attacker needs a local user account on the vulnerable AIX system.
- **Understanding of RPATHs:** A basic understanding of how RPATHs work in AIX is required.
- **Ability to manipulate the library loading process:** The attacker must be capable of influencing the dynamic library loading mechanism.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was addressed by adding the '-bnolibpath' flag to the DLL link flags. This flag restricts the loader section of shared libraries to only include the default library paths, thus mitigating the risk.
- This issue was resolved via a pull request in the Eclipse OMR GitHub repository: `https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pull/4136`.
- The fix was to prevent the inclusion of paths specified in '-L' flags which may reveal build system information or be used to inject malicious libraries.
- The fix was applied to all versions prior to the 0.1 release of the project.
