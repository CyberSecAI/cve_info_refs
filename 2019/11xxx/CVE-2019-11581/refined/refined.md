Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is a server-side template injection vulnerability found in the `ContactAdministrators` and `SendBulkMail` actions of Jira Server and Data Center.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Server-Side Template Injection:** The application is vulnerable to template injection, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code within the template processing mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the vulnerable Jira instance. This grants the attacker complete control over the system, including access to sensitive data, configuration, and potentially the entire infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Attack (if Contact Administrators form enabled):** If an SMTP server is configured, and the "Contact Administrators" form is enabled, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability without authentication.
*   **Authenticated Attack (with JIRA Administrator access):** An attacker with "JIRA Administrators" privileges can exploit the vulnerability if an SMTP server is configured.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated attacker:** Required if the "Contact Administrators" form is enabled and an SMTP server is configured.
*   **Authenticated attacker:** An attacker with "JIRA Administrators" access is required if the "Contact Administrators" form is disabled, but an SMTP server is configured.

**Affected Versions:**

*   All versions of Jira Server and Data Center from 4.4.0 before 7.6.14, from 7.7.0 before 7.13.5, from 8.0.0 before 8.0.3, from 8.1.0 before 8.1.2, and from 8.2.0 before 8.2.3 are affected.

**Fix:**

*   The vulnerability is addressed in versions 8.2.3, 8.1.2, 8.0.3, 7.13.5, and 7.6.14.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as a "Severity 1 - Critical" issue.
*   It is associated with the labels: `CVE-2019-11581`, `advisory`, `advisory-released`, `bugbounty`, `cvss-high`, `injection`, `rce`, and `security`.
*   The vulnerability was introduced in version 4.04.
