### CVE-2019-11024
The content relates to CVE-2019-11024.

**Root cause:** An infinite recursive loop exists in the `load_pnm()` function within the `frompnm.c` file. This occurs because the `while` loop condition `*s == '\0'` is not met when `line[0]` is `0x0`, leading to recursive calls to `pnm_get_line()` without ever exiting the loop.

**Vulnerability:** Improper input validation allows a crafted PNM file to trigger the infinite loop.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vector:** Passing a specially crafted PNM file to the `img2sixel` binary.

**Required attacker capabilities:** Ability to provide a malicious PNM file as input to the `img2sixel` program.

**Affected versions:** Libsixel version 1.8.2.
