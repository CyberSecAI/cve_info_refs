The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11392.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `SyndicationHandler.cs` file in BlogEngine.NET, where the application parses an XML document from a user-provided URL specified via the `apml` parameter in the `syndication.axd` endpoint. The application does not disable external entity processing while parsing the XML, enabling an attacker to inject malicious XML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or disable external entity processing when parsing the XML file referenced in the `apml` parameter, allowing for XXE injection.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring user authentication.
- **Unvalidated Input:** The application directly uses the user-provided URL in `apml` parameter without validating the scheme or path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.
- **Out-of-band data exfiltration:** The attacker can exfiltrate the content of the files via an out-of-band channel using HTTP requests.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** An attacker sends a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/syndication.axd` endpoint including the `apml` parameter referencing a malicious XML file on an external server.
- **Malicious XML Payload:** The malicious XML file contains a reference to an external DTD file which, in turn, defines entities that allow the attacker to read local files on the server and send their contents to an attacker-controlled server through HTTP requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
- **External Server:** The attacker needs an external server to host the malicious XML and DTD files as well as receiving the exfiltrated data.
