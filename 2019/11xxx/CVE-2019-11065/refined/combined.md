## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 29 Beta Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC228](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC228 "Changes/GLIBC228")
* [BINUTILS230](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS230 "Changes/BINUTILS230")
* [i686\_Is\_For\_x86-64](/wiki/Changes/i686_Is_For_x86-64 "Changes/i686 Is For x86-64")
* [BINUTILS231](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS231 "Changes/BINUTILS231")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Wednesday, July 11th. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

**NOTE:** As  [BINUTILS231](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS231 "Changes/BINUTILS231")  requires more time to test and fix issues,
we are postponing the mass rebuild and we will re-evaluate the status on Friday, July 13th.

**NOTE:** Issues with  [BINUTILS231](/wiki/Changes/BINUTILS231 "Changes/BINUTILS231")  got fixed with binutils-2.30.90-3.fc29
build, so we are starting mass rebuilds early on Thursday, July 12th.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f29
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f29. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f29 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f29
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

* [Packages that failed to build](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f29-failures.html)
* [Packages that need to be rebuilt](https://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org/mass-rebuild/f29-need-rebuild.html)

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a rpm build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild.

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f29-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f29 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

## Feedback

Questions/comments/concerns should be directed to [[1]](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/devel), or #fedora-releng on freenode IRC.

## Goal

The goal is to rebuild every single Fedora package, regardless of
content, before the Fedora 30 Change Deadline.

## Driving Features

* [GLIBC 2.29](/wiki/Changes/GLIBC229 "Changes/GLIBC229")
* [Fully remove deprecated and unsafe functions from libcrypt](/wiki/Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt "Changes/FullyRemoveDeprecatedAndUnsafeFunctionsFromLibcrypt")
* [Boost 1.69](/wiki/Changes/F30Boost169 "Changes/F30Boost169")
* [golang 1.12](/wiki/Changes/golang1.12 "Changes/golang1.12")

## Schedule

Given the changes required for the above features and the given
schedules, Release Engineering will be ready to start scripted rebuilds
on Thursday, January 31st. All automated rebuilds should be finished prior to the Feature Freeze.
Any clean-up manual rebuilds should be finished prior to the Beta Change Deadline.

## Scripts

Release Engineering has created two scripts. One is to initiate the builds, and the other is to query for items still needing to be built.

### Build Initiation

The rebuild [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-rebuild.py) works in the following way:

```
 Generate a list of all packages in f30
 Loop through each package:
   Query if a build has already been attempted/completed since koji changes went live.
   If so, move to next package
   If not, check out git
   rpmdev-bumpspec
   fedpkg commit -cp
   fedpkg (background) build
   Move on to next package

```

Each step will have some error catching and logging so that people
can clean up the various failures for whatever reasons. The builds will
be background builds, which will allow other builds done to take higher
priority when a builder has a free slot. However maintainers should
take care when doing this so that the background build won't take
'latest' precedent when it finishes. Asking rel-eng to kill the
scripted build will typically be enough.

### Build Tagging

Once the rebuild script has finished, another [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/mass-tag.py) will run to tag the builds into f30. This script will check that a newer build hasn't been done or started in f30 since the scripted rebuild was submitted. This will protect against the scripted rebuild overriding an even newer build done while the scripted rebuild was waiting in the background.

### Status Query

Release Engineering has developed a [script](https://pagure.io/releng/blob/master/f/scripts/need-rebuild.py) to query f30
and report on packages that have yet to be rebuilt. Results of these
queries will be delivered to various places, yet to be determined,
broken down by maintainer for easier discovery of work needed.

## Maintainer Actions

* Maintainers can help this effort by ensuring **rpmdev-bumpspec** correctly bumps your package's spec files.
* Maintainers should ensure that their packages currently build from source.
* Maintainers should ensure that there are no unwanted changes committed to git but not built yet.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When will my own build "count" for the rebuild?

After the last piece needed for the mass rebuild a gcc build was put into place, a build done by a maintainer will "count" toward the rebuild. 2019-01-31 10:10:00 is the UTC time that builds count from

### Will the rebuilds be ordered?

Currently there is no plan to logically order the rebuilds based on deps. The ordering will be alphanumerical based on package name. There are no planned ABI/soname changes that would require logical build ordering. Further, all the builds will be kept in a special tag (f30-rebuild) until the whole run is done, and then they will be tagged into f30 in one shot to minimize the shuffle of buildroot contents during the rebuilds.

| Hi Team,  We are using plugin : 'Java' in our gradle project.  As this vulnerability is for 'Javascript' and 'Coffeescript' plugin, is it necessary for us to upgrade gradle version?  Kindly suggest. |

| If you are using the API in your build script to add the repository then there is a potential. A deeper analysis would be require for finding out if you are indeed vulnerable when using the API. All this change does is default to HTTPS when adding the repository. If you don't use the API, there is nothing to worry about on that specific issue. |

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-902786bc1e
2019-05-03 01:35:16.417415
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : gradle
Product : Fedora 28
Version : 4.3.1
Release : 9.fc28
URL : <http://www.gradle.org/>
Summary : Build automation tool
Description :
Gradle is build automation evolved. Gradle can automate the building,
testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other
types of projects such as generated static websites, generated
documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to
build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle
provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through
sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of
choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and
legacy automation challenges.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-1b6383acdd
2019-08-19 01:01:06.548818
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : gradle
Product : Fedora 30
Version : 4.4.1
Release : 4.fc30
URL : <http://www.gradle.org/>
Summary : Build automation tool
Description :
Gradle is build automation evolved. Gradle can automate the building,
testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other
types of projects such as generated static websites, generated
documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to
build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle
provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through
sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of
choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and
legacy automation challenges.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2019-a9c15101fb
2019-05-21 02:19:57.402304
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : gradle
Product : Fedora 29
Version : 4.3.1
Release : 9.fc29
URL : <http://www.gradle.org/>
Summary : Build automation tool
Description :
Gradle is build automation evolved. Gradle can automate the building,
testing, publishing, deployment and more of software packages or other
types of projects such as generated static websites, generated
documentation or indeed anything else.

Gradle combines the power and flexibility of Ant with the dependency
management and conventions of Maven into a more effective way to
build. Powered by a Groovy DSL and packed with innovation, Gradle
provides a declarative way to describe all kinds of builds through
sensible defaults. Gradle is quickly becoming the build system of
choice for many open source projects, leading edge enterprises and
legacy automation challenges.
