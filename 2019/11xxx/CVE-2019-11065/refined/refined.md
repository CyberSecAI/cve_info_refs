Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11065:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from Gradle using an insecure HTTP URL (`http://ajax.googleapis.com`) to download dependencies when the built-in JavaScript or CoffeeScript Gradle plugins are used.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insecure Protocol:** Usage of HTTP instead of HTTPS for downloading dependencies. This exposes the download process to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
- **Dependency Download:** The vulnerability exists when specific Gradle plugins (JavaScript, CoffeeScript) are used, triggering the download of dependencies from the insecure URL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Maliciously Compromised Artifacts:** An attacker performing a MITM attack could inject malicious code into the downloaded dependencies, which would then be incorporated into the user's project during build time.
- **Supply Chain Attack:** This could lead to a supply chain attack where compromised dependencies could propagate to other projects that rely on the affected code.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker needs to be positioned between the user's machine and the `ajax.googleapis.com` server to intercept and modify the downloaded files.
- **Network-Level Access:** The attacker needs to have access to the network traffic to perform the MITM attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must have the ability to intercept network traffic between the Gradle user and the `ajax.googleapis.com` server.
- **MITM Capability:** The attacker must be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept and modify the data in transit.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Gradle versions from 1.4 to 5.3.1
- The fix involves switching the dependency download URL from `http://` to `https://`, ensuring the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
- The fix was backported to older versions of Fedora (28 and 29) and Fedora 30.
- Users not utilizing the affected JavaScript or CoffeeScript plugins are not vulnerable.
-  The issue is present when the API is used to add the repository, not when not using the API.
