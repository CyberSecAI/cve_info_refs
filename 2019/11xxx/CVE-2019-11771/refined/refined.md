Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the presence of unused RPATHs in AIX builds of Eclipse OpenJ9 before version 0.15.0.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unused RPATHs:** The inclusion of RPATHs (runtime search paths) that are not actually needed creates an exploitable weakness.
*   **Code Injection and Privilege Elevation:**  The unused RPATHs could be manipulated by a local attacker to inject malicious code. This can further lead to privilege escalation, where the attacker gains higher-level permissions on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Injection:** Malicious code can be injected into the system through the manipulated RPATHs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Privilege Elevation:** A successful exploit could allow a local user to gain higher privileges than they should have.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** This vulnerability is exploitable by local users who have access to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker must have a valid user account on the vulnerable system to be able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is related to CWE-264, which refers to weaknesses in the management of permissions, privileges, and other security features for access control.
*   The issue was resolved with a fix that was made available in a pull request.
