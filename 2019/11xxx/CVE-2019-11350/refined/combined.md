RELEASED: Public: 2019-05-15

* [CloudBees Enterprise License Entitlement Check plugin](/plugins/ci/nectar-license)

## New features

* CloudBees Internal Ticket: PRODSEC-52]

Problem: When a Jenkins CloudBees license expires, the passwords for the
proxy server configuration may be exposed in cleartext embedded in the
HTML and the proxy configuration page is opened.

This update changes the ux rendering logic so that it properly masks
secrets.
