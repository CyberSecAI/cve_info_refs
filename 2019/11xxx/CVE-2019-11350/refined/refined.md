Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the storage of proxy server configuration passwords in cleartext within the Jenkins CloudBees application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Password Storage:** Passwords for proxy server configurations are stored unencrypted.
- **Password Retrieval:** These passwords can be retrieved when a trial license expires and the proxy configuration page is opened. The credentials are then embedded in cleartext within the HTML source code of the page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain access to the proxy server credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control over the proxy server and any systems accessible through it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves accessing an expired trial license of Jenkins CloudBees and navigating to the proxy configuration page, which will expose the credentials in the HTML source.
    - Steps:
        1. Open a Jenkins CloudBees application with an expired trial license.
        2. Click "Request Trial License."
        3. View the HTML source code, and extract the username and password from the HTML form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to an instance of Jenkins CloudBees with an expired trial license.
- The attacker needs to be able to view the HTML source of the page where the proxy configuration is displayed.
