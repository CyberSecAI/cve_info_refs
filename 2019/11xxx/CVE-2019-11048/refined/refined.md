Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11048:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from integer wraparounds in the `rfc1867.c` file within the PHP source code. This occurs when processing multipart/form-data file uploads. Specifically, the lengths of filenames and form variables are calculated as signed integers and can overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** When a large filename or multipart/form-data variable is received, the length calculation results in a signed integer overflow, leading to negative values.
*   **Memory Allocation Failure:** The negative value after overflow is later converted to a large unsigned 64bit integer, which when used in a memory allocation function `estrndup` or `erealloc` leads to allocation failure
*   **Uncleaned Temporary Files:** Due to the memory allocation failure and subsequent premature script termination, temporary files created during the upload process are not properly deleted, causing disk space exhaustion.
*  **Pathological Configuration:** The issue can be triggered when `post_max_size` is configured with a value greater than or equal to 2GB.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A remote attacker can repeatedly crash PHP and fill the filesystem with temporary PHP files, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Disk Space Exhaustion:** The accumulation of uncleaned temporary files can exhaust disk space on the target server.
* **Potential Memory Exhaustion:** The oversized memory allocation attempts can lead to out-of-memory conditions.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Multipart/form-data file uploads:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file with an extremely large array-like filename or by sending a multipart/form-data variable with length exceeding the maximum positive 32 bit integer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Remote attacker:** The attacker can be remote, leveraging HTTP to send malicious multipart/form-data requests.
*   **Configuration:** A specific configuration where `post_max_size` is set to a value greater than or equal to 2GB on the server.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the `post_max_size` setting is configured to a large value (e.g., 2GB or higher)
*   The issue exists in `SAPI_API SAPI_POST_HANDLER_FUNC(rfc1867_post_handler)` in `php-src/main/rfc1867.c`.
*   Upstream fixes were provided in PHP versions 7.2.31, 7.3.18, and 7.4.6, as well as backported patches.
