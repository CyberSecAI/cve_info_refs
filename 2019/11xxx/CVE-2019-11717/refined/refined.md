## CVE-2019-11717

Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The caret ("^") character was not properly escaped when constructing certain URIs. This is because the character is used as a separator for origin attributes within the browser's internal representation of URIs. This improper escaping allowed the caret character to be interpreted as part of the hostname, leading to potential spoofing of origin attributes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper escaping:** The core issue is the lack of proper escaping for the caret character when used in a specific context (constructing URIs with origin attributes).
- **Origin Spoofing:** The vulnerability allows a malformed URI to be constructed in a way that can confuse the browser's origin-checking mechanism.
- **Inconsistent handling:**  The browser's URL parsing was inconsistent with other browsers, and didn't adhere to stricter hostname rules found in older RFCs, allowing the caret character within hostnames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Spoofing of Origin Attributes:** By using a caret character in a URI, an attacker could potentially spoof the origin attribute of a given URI, leading to potential security risks. 
-  While the provided text does not specify the exact attacks, it can be inferred that this spoofing could cause security issues on web sites with insufficient input sanitization.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   A specifically crafted URI with an unescaped caret character within the hostname.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need the ability to create a malformed URI with an unescaped caret character in the hostname.
- The attacker may need to induce a user to navigate to a specific URL or otherwise process the manipulated URL.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability primarily affects how URIs are internally handled by the browser, specifically related to origin attributes.
- The fix involves ensuring the caret character is properly escaped during URI construction.
- The Mozilla Security Advisory states that this is a moderate-severity issue, meaning exploitation is possible but not very common.

This vulnerability was fixed in Firefox ESR 60.8, Firefox 68, and Thunderbird 60.8.
