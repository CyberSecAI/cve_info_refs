  "CVE-2019-11037": {
    "description": "An out-of-bounds write to memory has been found in PHP imagick extension versions between 3.3.0 - 3.4.4 in function ImagickKernel::fromMatrix() leading to possible crash and DoS.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a missing bounds check when writing to an array of values in the `ImagickKernel::fromMatrix()` function. The address to be written to is calculated based on user-controlled input and if this address falls outside the allocated array, an out-of-bounds write occurs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
    "impact": "An out-of-bounds write can lead to a crash, denial of service (DoS), or potentially arbitrary code execution, if exploited with specific values.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network: By calling the vulnerable function with crafted input."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to call the vulnerable function `ImagickKernel::fromMatrix()` with a matrix and origin data they control. This may be through a web application or any other PHP application using the vulnerable php-imagick extension.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerable code was introduced in version 3.3.0 of the php-imagick extension. The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.4.4. The issue is located in the `imagickkernel_class.c` file. The `UnityAddKernelInfo` function, which calculates the address to write to, has a weakness, that allows to compute an address outside the allocated range, if the origin coordinates are crafted in a way which results in an out-of-bounds memory write."
