## Description

![@H4niz](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30542876?u=968971350f1448c5205bf80a81f56b7280b15652&v=4&size=48)[H4niz](https://github.com/H4niz)opened [on Apr 16, 2019](https://github.com/lh3/bwa/issues/239#issue-433906002)

I found a buffer overflow in [bns\_fasta2bntseq] function.

```
int64_t bns_fasta2bntseq(gzFile fp_fa, const char *prefix, int for_only)
{
	extern void seq_reverse(int len, ubyte_t *seq, int is_comp); // in bwaseqio.c
	kseq_t *seq;
	char name[1024];
	bntseq_t *bns;
	uint8_t *pac = 0;
	int32_t m_seqs, m_holes;
	int64_t ret = -1, m_pac, l;
	bntamb1_t *q;
	FILE *fp;

	// initialization
	....
	strcpy(name, prefix); strcat(name, ".pac");
	...
	return ret;
}

```

The name buffer has only 1024 bytes, in order that buffer overflow occurs if we pass more than 1024 bytes as prefix. It's a vulnerability
