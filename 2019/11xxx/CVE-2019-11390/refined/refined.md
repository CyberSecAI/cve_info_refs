Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2019-11390:

**Content Related to CVE-2019-11390:**

The provided content discusses two separate issues related to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerabilities within the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS). While neither issue explicitly mentions CVE-2019-11390, the description of the vulnerabilities, specifically related to regex complexity and backtracking, suggests a possible connection since the CVE description is unavailable.

**Issue #1372**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within a complex regular expression due to the use of nested alternation and repetition, specifically: `(?:(?:(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[^\"'`]+[\"'`])+|(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[\d\"'`]+)+)\s*?(?:n(?:and|ot)`. This causes excessive backtracking by the regex engine when processing specially crafted input.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **ReDoS:** The specific regex pattern is susceptible to catastrophic backtracking.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By providing malicious input, an attacker can cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious Input: The vulnerability is triggered by crafted input strings that cause the regex engine to backtrack excessively.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests that will be evaluated by ModSecurity with the vulnerable rule set enabled.

**Issue #1358**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is in rule 933160 within `/crs/rules/REQUEST-933-APPLICATION-ATTACK-PHP.conf`, caused by nested repetition operators in the regex.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **ReDoS:** The regex is vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause excessive CPU consumption by providing a specific string.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Malicious Input:  The provided string `set_error_handler########################################################` triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send requests that will be evaluated by ModSecurity with the vulnerable rule set enabled.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The content refers to an interview where the researcher states that the full exploit strings are not published to prevent abuse, only the vulnerable regex parts are highlighted.
*   The researcher mentions that while they could not reproduce the issue in a Python regex engine, they could reproduce it using a PHP regex engine. This indicates the possibility that the vulnerability might be engine specific.

**Summary**
The provided content describes ReDoS vulnerabilities in the OWASP ModSecurity CRS. The root cause for both issues is inefficient regular expressions which leads to excessive backtracking and ultimately DoS when processing malicious input strings.
