  "CVE-2019-11775": {
    "description": "IBM JDK: Failure to privatize a value pulled out of the loop by versioning",
    "root_cause": "The loop versioner in Eclipse OpenJ9 may fail to privatize a value that is pulled out of the loop by versioning. Specifically, if a condition that is moved out of the loop reads a field, the value of that field might not be privatized in the modified copy of the loop. This can lead to the loop seeing a modified field value without retesting the condition that was moved out of the loop.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-367",
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition"
    ],
    "impact": "This can lead to various issues, including out-of-array-bounds access and memory corruption, potentially enabling attackers to perform invalid actions or gain elevated privileges on the system.",
     "attack_vector": "Local attacker",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute code in a Java environment that uses IBM JDK. No further privilege escalation is required as it is a local attack."
