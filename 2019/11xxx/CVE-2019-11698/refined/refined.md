Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way Firefox handles drag-and-drop operations involving bookmarks containing "place:" URIs (which are used to query browser history). When a user drags a crafted hyperlink to the bookmark bar or sidebar, then drags the resulting bookmark into a webpage, the browser transmits the results of the history query to the content page through the `drop` event's `text/html` data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is that the `text/html` data associated with the dropped bookmark contains the result of a Places query which includes arbitrary user history data. This allows an attacker to craft a bookmark containing a `place:` URL to extract specific user history.
- **Lack of origin checks:** The browser does not sufficiently validate the origin or intended destination of the dropped data when a `place:` URI is involved. This allows the data to be exposed to untrusted web content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Theft of browsing history:** By tricking a user into dragging and dropping a malicious bookmark, an attacker can obtain a user's browsing history, which can reveal sensitive information.
- **Potential for targeted attacks:** With the ability to query history using specific terms, attackers could potentially target users with very specific browsing patterns, allowing them to tailor further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Drag-and-drop:** The attack relies on the user dragging and dropping a crafted hyperlink into the bookmarks bar/sidebar and then dragging the created bookmark into a malicious webpage.
- **Malicious links:**  Attackers would need to lure users into adding a specific malicious link as a bookmark, which they could do through social engineering or by compromising other websites.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to create web content:** The attacker needs to be able to create a webpage that can receive the history data through the `drop` event.
- **User interaction:** The attack requires the user to perform drag-and-drop actions, including adding the crafted bookmark and then dragging the created bookmark to the malicious website.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "moderate" severity due to the required user interaction, although initially there was some debate about classifying it as "high" due to the possibility of obtaining specific user data with the use of Places queries.
- The fix involves preventing the creation of custom history views from content and removing the ability to add place URIs to the clipboard via content.
- There is a discussion of future improvements, such as adding checks for the data origin, to prevent similar vulnerabilities in the future.
- The fix has been verified in Firefox 67 and 68, as well as ESR 60.7, with no further reported issues related to this exploit.
- The vulnerability was reported by an external security researcher, Abdulrahman Alqabandi.
