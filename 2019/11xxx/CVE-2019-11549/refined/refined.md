- **Root cause of vulnerability:** When a project maintainer sets up a repository mirror using a git URL with a password and the mirror update fails, the password is leaked in plain text in the error message displayed in the web UI, and also in the GitLab server production logs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Plaintext storage of passwords in error messages and log files.
    - Improper handling of sensitive data when mirroring fails.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Unauthorized disclosure of repository mirror passwords.
    - Exposure of passwords to other maintainer-level users who might not have set the mirrors.
    - Exposure of passwords to anyone with access to the GitLab server log files, including those shipped to central syslog servers.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - Setting up a repository mirror with a git URL and password
    - Triggering a failure in the mirroring process (e.g. invalid IP, incorrect URL, or a pre-existing project).
    - Accessing the web UI to observe error messages when mirror update fails
    - Direct access to the server's filesystem where GitLab logs are stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - Must have maintainer access to a GitLab project to set up a repository mirror
    - Ability to view error messages when mirror update fails
    - Access to the GitLab server's filesystem or central syslog server where the logs are sent.
