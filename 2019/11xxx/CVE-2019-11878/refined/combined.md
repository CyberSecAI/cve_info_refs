[00:01] hello my name is Ian and welcome to my
[00:03] demo and explanation of a do s attack
[00:06] that I found for Jean my net cams for
[00:11] this the specific model used is a Bester
[00:14] IP 20 h1 but it actually is a Jean my
[00:17] camera they're just white label that's
[00:20] just how China works alright so the
[00:23] overview is basically this I found a
[00:25] denial of service attack that exploits a
[00:27] bad conversion from you int 32 to + 32
[00:35] and it doesn't work out so great for the
[00:38] camera when it tries this and the
[00:42] problem basically affects the it affects
[00:46] all commands that you are privileged
[00:48] enough to run so I specifically targeted
[00:52] for this attack of the login function of
[00:56] the device because you can always run
[00:59] login you can you can literally be the
[01:01] most unprivileged user and you can
[01:04] always run login so let's jump on into
[01:07] it so the first part of it is that there
[01:10] is a message structure that is sent
[01:14] between the camera and the client this
[01:21] message basically is a 20-byte header
[01:24] these are all the fields that are in the
[01:26] header type session ID some unknown
[01:29] fields magic and size none of these
[01:31] matter for the exploit all that matters
[01:33] is magic and size here you could
[01:36] literally make these guys pretty much
[01:38] anything I think except for type which
[01:39] has a little special thing that it does
[01:42] but both the magic and size are really
[01:46] what we need to focus on here so magic
[01:49] actually controls the command that's run
[01:52] it is au at 16 so it's a two byte field
[01:59] you know for this instance the magic
[02:02] we're going to use is 0-3 e 8 which is
[02:04] the login magic and then we have size
[02:08] now in you know when you look at the
[02:10] field it looks like it's au and 32 so i
[02:13] denoted
[02:13] such but it's actually in 32 that gets
[02:17] improperly casted and it should never
[02:19] size should never be in in 32 because it
[02:22] should never be negative as you can see
[02:24] why in a sec so let me just run over
[02:28] here real quick and grab this bad boy
[02:30] all right so this is there we go
[02:37] so this is a test program that I wrote
[02:40] that shows exactly what I'm talking
[02:42] about here I is eight zero zero zero
[02:46] zero zero zero or whatever and it's an
[02:48] int right J is just one below that when
[02:52] we print the two J is as it should be
[02:54] but I is negative which is not
[02:57] necessarily something you might expect
[02:59] or want especially for a size variable
[03:02] obviously size should never be negative
[03:06] so we'll just close that guy out real
[03:09] quick so let's move on to the actual
[03:12] exploit here so right now I have the
[03:18] login string with just a regular thing a
[03:23] regular size which is the size of zero
[03:27] four right now and this won't cause a
[03:29] crash this will reply back with a with a
[03:36] basically a log and failed that's what
[03:39] the ret 205 in this little thing means
[03:43] so yeah now that we've seen it it works
[03:45] normally we're gonna give it a try now
[03:47] with a higher number all right so let's
[03:56] run this bad boy and before I run this
[03:59] I'm gonna start the timer I'm gonna run
[04:01] a ping and then I want you to pay very
[04:03] close attention to the Android phones
[04:06] timer that little timer that's ticking
[04:09] up shows that it's still alive feed and
[04:12] that timer is gonna stop in a second and
[04:15] stop working so we're gonna run let me
[04:18] start my ping here real quick i
[04:21] stopwatch and then run and then BAM so
[04:25] we get a receive AOF and this is extreme
[04:27] important that it's a neo F because it
[04:29] actually means that the socket closed so
[04:32] the server crashed it hits something
[04:34] something bad happen in the socket
[04:35] itself a tit as you'll see it's still
[04:42] responds to pings too but it'll only do
[04:45] that for a little while it is rebooting
[04:47] right now and you can see on the Android
[04:49] phone that the timer has in fact stopped
[04:51] I'm actually waving my hand in front of
[04:52] the camera right now you can't see it
[04:56] this this exploit is kind of cool
[04:58] because it does kind of have that
[04:59] Hollywood hacker esque
[05:01] vibe to it where you know you crash the
[05:03] camera it just holds a still frame of
[05:06] the image the only way you know that the
[05:08] cameras failed if you're just sitting
[05:10] here watching the client is that it
[05:15] won't come back it'll just sit there and
[05:18] connect and you know the timer the timer
[05:21] is a good indication that something went
[05:23] wrong but the what's it called the timer
[05:36] isn't actually enabled at you know by
[05:39] default on the camera so basically you
[05:44] know if you were just watching it you
[05:46] would never know that something happened
[05:49] so we're just waiting here you can see
[05:51] the time it's starting to timeout on the
[05:53] ICMP s it's gonna start giving us a
[05:56] destination under host unreachable but
[05:58] it'll come back fairly quickly usually
[06:04] it doesn't take too long before the guy
[06:06] comes back there we go came back
[06:11] cool yeah very exciting so yeah again
[06:15] this totally is unprivileged you don't
[06:17] even need to or you don't even need to
[06:20] be logged into the camera to do this it
[06:22] just it works well anyways thanks for
[06:24] watching I hope you enjoyed it if you
