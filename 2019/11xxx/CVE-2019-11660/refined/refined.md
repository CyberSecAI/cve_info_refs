Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11660:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the `omniresolve` component within Micro Focus Data Protector, which allows a low-privileged user to execute a custom binary with elevated privileges. This indicates a flaw in how `omniresolve` handles privilege escalation or external binary execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Privilege Escalation:** The core weakness is the ability for a low-privileged user to run arbitrary code with higher privileges. This is a classic privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Uncontrolled Execution:** The `omniresolve` component is vulnerable to executing custom or attacker-controlled binaries. This suggests a lack of proper input validation or restrictions on what executables it can launch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Full System Compromise:** An attacker can gain complete control over the affected system by executing malicious code with high privileges. This includes the ability to read, write, and delete any files, install malware, and perform other malicious activities.
- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** An attacker can access sensitive data, potentially modify it, or exfiltrate it to a remote location.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker could also cause a denial of service by damaging the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access, which means the attacker needs to be logged into the affected system with a low-privileged account. This significantly reduces the attack surface compared to a remote attack vector but still poses a serious risk.
- **Custom Binary:** The attack requires the attacker to supply a custom binary which `omniresolve` will execute. This gives an attacker full control of what code is executed with escalated privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low-Privilege Account:** The attacker must possess a valid user account with low-level privileges on the target system where Data Protector is installed.
- **Ability to Create/Modify Executables:** The attacker must have the ability to create or modify executables that will be run by the vulnerable component.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** The vulnerability affects Micro Focus Data Protector versions 10.00, 10.01, 10.02, 10.03, 10.04, 10.10, 10.20, 10.30, and 10.40.
- **CVSS Score:**
  - CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 8.2 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating high impact.
   - CVSS v2.0 Base Score: 6.6 (AV:L/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C), which also indicates a significant vulnerability
- **Mitigation:** Micro Focus recommends updating Data Protector to version 2019.08 (A.10.50) or higher.

In summary, CVE-2019-11660 is a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Micro Focus Data Protector that could enable a low-privileged user to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges, posing a significant security risk.
