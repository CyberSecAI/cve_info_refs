Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11470:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content clearly relates to CVE-2019-11470. The descriptions from multiple sources, including SUSE, Debian, and the github issue, all mention a denial-of-service vulnerability in the `ReadCINImage` function due to incorrect parsing of Cineon image sizes.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `ReadCINImage` function (`coders/cin.c`) within ImageMagick. Specifically, the code fails to check for insufficient image data when parsing a Cineon image file, especially when the claimed image size in the header is incorrect.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The incorrect image size leads to ImageMagick attempting to allocate excessive memory or compute resources, causing a denial of service.
    *   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of a check to verify that the image data provided matches the size declared in the file header.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Successful exploitation leads to uncontrolled resource consumption, which could crash the application, making it unavailable for legitimate users.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Crafted Cineon Image:** An attacker must create a specifically crafted Cineon image file with an incorrect image size in the header.
    *   **File Processing:** The attack is triggered when a vulnerable version of ImageMagick processes this crafted image file, for example by using `convert` command.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to supply the crafted Cineon image file to the target system. 
    *   The attacker does not need specific privileges on the target system.
    *   The SUSE information indicates that a user interaction may be required to process a malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The GitHub issue #1472 provides a description of the problem, sample code for reproduction with the `convert` command and a sample `cin` file for testing. It also contains a gdb debugging session showing how the `image->columns` and `image->rows` variables are assigned incorrect values.
*   The fix included a check in `coders/cin.c` to ensure that image data is sufficient (as provided in the git commit).
*   The SUSE information provides a CVSSv2 score of 7.1 (AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C) and a CVSSv3 score of 5.5 (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) emphasizing the potential for complete availability impact (DoS). However, they also mention the need for user interaction to process the malicious file.
*   The Debian Security Advisory (DLA 1968-1) highlights the resource consumption issue with the `ReadCINImage` function, mentioning that "This vulnerability might be leveraged by remote attackers to cause denial of service via a crafted Cineon image".
*   The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4034-1) also points out that an attacker can cause denial of service by opening a specially crafted image file with ImageMagick.

In summary, CVE-2019-11470 highlights a denial-of-service vulnerability due to insufficient input sanitization when parsing Cineon image files. This vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker who provides a crafted file, and the fix involves adding checks for sufficient image data based on the header's claims.
