The pc-kernel snap build process hardcoded the
--allow-insecure-repositories and --allow-unauthenticated apt options when
creating the build chroot environment. This could allow an attacker who is
able to perform a MITM attack between the build environment and the Ubuntu
archive to install a malicious package within the build chroot. This issue
affects pc-kernel versions prior to and including 2019-07-16

# Snap kernel build process installs unauthenticated packages

Bug #1836041 reported by
[Sachi King](https://launchpad.net/~nakato)
on 2019-07-10

### Bug Description

With reference to the source code of:

[https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-snap/+git/bionic/tree/Makefile](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snap/%2Bgit/bionic/tree/Makefile)

and

[https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-snap/+git/xenial/tree/Makefile](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snap/%2Bgit/xenial/tree/Makefile)

The xenial link seems to be the snapcraft 'pc-kernel:latest/stable' image. I'm just taking a guess that the bionic one is the '18' series kernel in snapcraft.

Inside these Makefiles, it uses a number of hardcoded http URLS. One is a PPA URL to launchpad, which should be paramaterised (I can't hit it from a corporate network), and the other is a paramaterised URL hard-coded to use 'http'.

After setting these http endpoints, it then calls 'apt-get update' with ' --allow-insecure-repositories' in the 'bionic' setting, and in the 'bionic' and 'xenial' setting it calls, 'apt-get install' with '--allow-unauthenticated'

If how I interpret this is correct, this would allow the build to be susceptible to MITM attacks, or mirror or cache tampering.

The pramaterised endpoint is `ftpmaster.internal/ubuntu` by default, and should probably point to '[http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/'](http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/%27) or something that is buildable by end-users as well, especially seeing as it is the default if building from the snapcraft.yaml file, see following link, sets 'PROPOSED=true' in the 'make-parameters' section of the build.

[https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-snap/+git/xenial/tree/snapcraft.yaml?h=pc](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snap/%2Bgit/xenial/tree/snapcraft.yaml?h=pc)

Hello Sachi - Thanks for reporting this issue! We agree that the use of the --allow-insecure-repositories and --allow-unauthenticated options is poor form and should not be used in the makefiles for building kernel snaps.

In practice, I think that this would be difficult to attack since the traffic between the builders and launchpad itself should be well controlled. There's obviously no sense in leaving that attack vector open so we'll get it fixed up. As you correctly pointed out, fixing it also benefits end-users that attempt to use the affected makefile target.

Thanks again! We'll be working to fix this issue.

I did some work on this and got to know the makefile and its purpose a

little better. I'm able to respond to more of the initial bug report

now.

To be clear, this is not a security issue. Ubuntu uses http URLs for apt

archives. The files served over http are signed and then verified by the

client.

I'll update the bug title to remove the mention of http mirrors being an

issue.

You can override the use of the ftpmaster.internal/ubuntu mirror URL

using the MIRROR make variable like so:

$ sudo make KERNEL=linux-pc-image MIRROR=us.archive.ubuntu.com

The default mirror used is a separate, non-security issue and should not

be tracked by this particular bug report.

Here's my proposed fix for the Bionic tree. I was able to verify that the 'all' target works as expected in a pristine Bionic amd64 VM using the following command:

$ sudo make KERNEL=linux-pc-image MIRROR=us.archive.ubuntu.com DESTDIR=dest all

I compared the output of that command with and without my patch applied to verify that no unauthenticated repositories/packages are being used once that patch is applied.

I noticed that a cosmic tree exists and it is also affected:

[https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-snap/+git/cosmic](https://git.launchpad.net/~ubuntu-kernel/ubuntu/%2Bsource/linux-snap/%2Bgit/cosmic)

However, I don't believe that is used at all. I'd prefer that we simply remove that git tree rather than patch its Makefile.

@tyhicks confirmed there should not be a repository for cosmic. I will ensure it is gone.

@tyhick, to spread the info, we had to make some iterations over the bionic change (and the xenial one likely needs the same) because in the build environment it seems the additional repo is already added for the build environment. So as soon as you copy the outside sources.list into the chroot the dist-upgrade fails. We ended with a sequence of:

1. debootstrap

2. apt-get update inside

3. install gnupg inside

4. add the key inside

5. copy the outside repo into inside

6. add the additional repo inside (pointless in buildenv but meh)

7. run apt-get update inside

8. run apt-get dist-upgrade inside

Is there a tree/branch for UC20 work? UC20 series snaps are going to differ

quite a bit from UC18 due to initramfs handling, but I don't want to assume

that they will fix this particular bug as a side-effect.

The UC20 tree if it exists should certainly not be based on cosmic at this

point.

No, a tree/branch for UC20 does not yet exist.
