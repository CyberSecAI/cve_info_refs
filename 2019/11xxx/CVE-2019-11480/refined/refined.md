Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11480:

**Root Cause:**
The `pc-kernel` snap build process hardcoded the `--allow-insecure-repositories` and `--allow-unauthenticated` apt options during the creation of the build chroot environment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use of `--allow-insecure-repositories`: This option allows apt to use repositories that are not verified with a cryptographic key, opening the door for potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
- Use of `--allow-unauthenticated`: This option bypasses signature verification checks during package installation, allowing the installation of packages that may have been tampered with.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker performing a MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) attack between the build environment and the Ubuntu archive could inject and install a malicious package within the build chroot environment. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the build process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Man-in-the-middle attack during the package download/installation phase of the build process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to intercept and modify network traffic between the build environment and the Ubuntu archive (MITM position).
-  Ability to provide a malicious package when requested by the build process

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability affects `pc-kernel` versions prior to and including 2019-07-16.
- Patches have been released to address this vulnerability by removing the insecure apt options.
- The fix involves removing the usage of `--allow-insecure-repositories` and `--allow-unauthenticated` options.
- The vulnerability was initially reported with "Private Security" information type and later made public after the fix was released.
- The vulnerable code exists in the Makefiles used by the build process.
- The initial report also mentioned hardcoded HTTP URLs, but that was later deemed not a security issue as the files served over HTTP are signed and verified by the client.
- The issue was present in the Bionic and Xenial trees of the `linux-snap` repository.
- A `cosmic` tree was also found to be affected but was removed instead of being patched.
