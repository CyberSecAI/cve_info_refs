Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from improper parsing of DHCP hostname data within Synology Router Manager (SRM). Specifically, the `strtol` function within the `libsynodevice.so` library attempts to convert a string representing time in seconds to a long integer. This function is called after a line of the `device.dhcp` file is split by tabs, and the function doesn't properly validate if the required tab-separated fields are present in the dhcp entry, before trying to use the fourth field to perform the string-to-long conversion. This leads to an out-of-bounds read when a crafted DHCP hostname injection creates malformed lines with insufficient tab delimiters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the `strtol` function due to the lack of validation on the number of tab characters present within a line in the `device.dhcp` file.
*   **CRLF Injection:** An attacker can inject newline characters ('\n') into the `device.dhcp` file, resulting in malformed lines. This is achieved through injecting a newline character within the hostname of the DHCP request.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The `WriteAndUpdateRecords` and parent functions do not properly validate the hostname data in DHCP packets before processing it.
*   **File Content Injection:** The application uses data from untrusted sources (DHCP packets) to write to the file system without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to manipulate the `device.dhcp` file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   The out-of-bounds read leads to crashes in `synomonitordhcpd` and `synodeviced` services.
    *   Repeated crashes can prevent these services from restarting, causing a persistent DoS, disrupting the router's functionalities.
    *   Network devices can be shown as offline on the web interface when these services are down.
*   **File System Exhaustion:**
    *   By repeatedly injecting newline characters, the `device.dhcp` file size can be inflated, filling up the `/run` mount (tmpfs) and potentially causing the device to malfunction.
    *   Filling the /run partition can also cause a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted DHCP packets with malicious hostnames. The crafted hostname contains a newline character ('\n') which will eventually cause an out-of-bounds read.
*   **ARP Request:** The vulnerability is also triggered within the `synodeviced` service via ARP requests, which attempts to find the hostname for a discovered IP address.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable Synology router, or be able to send crafted DHCP packets to it.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any prior authentication.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Synology SRM versions before 1.2.3-8017-2.
*   The vendor fixed the issue by 2019-09-24.
*   The CVE was assigned on 2020-05-04 and publicly released on 2020-05-06.
* The CVSS score varies slightly, 7.4 by talos and 8.6 by synology.
