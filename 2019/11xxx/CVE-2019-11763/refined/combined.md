# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-33

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in - Firefox ESR 68.2

Announced
October 22, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 68.2

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

##### References

* [Bug 1584907](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584907)

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When following the value's prototype chain, it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577107)

#### [#CVE-2019-11758: Potentially exploitable crash due to 360 Total Security](#CVE-2019-11758)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla community member Philipp reported a memory safety bug present in Firefox 68 when 360 Total Security was installed. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption in the accessibility engine and we presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

* [Bug 1536227](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536227)

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577953](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577953)

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1577719](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577719)

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

##### References

* [Bug 1561502](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502)

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

##### References

* [Bug 1582857](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857)

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

* [Bug 1584216](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584216)

#### [#CVE-2019-11764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2](#CVE-2019-11764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

Freddy: what's [bug 1540675](/show_bug.cgi?id=1540675 "RESOLVED FIXED - Handle line breaks correctly in comment end bang state")? not a dupe, are you suggesting it's a possible regressor? Have you checked a pre-68 build that doesn't have this bug and that's why you suspect that one?

I'm at a conference and didn't find the time to properly up until now.

I just meant to tag it as "See Also" because it's a similar comment parsing bug. They are also both reported by Gareth Heyes.

He just dropped this in his presentation slides.

Henri, there seem to be some related null byte issues according to <https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet>

* Firefox allows NULLS after &, e.g. go to `data:text/html,<a href="javascript&%00%23x3a;alert(1)">Firefox</a>`
* Firefox allows NULLs inside named entities, e.g., `data:text/html,<a href="javascript&%00co%00lon;alert(1)">Firefox</a>`

Would this patch address those cases, if not, would it make sense to do so?

No, but I noticed those bugs while fixing this one.

I was thinking of filing another bug so that thing would be disclosable independently of those, but now that it's all here and already disclosed anyway, it doesn't matter for disclosure. I'll fix those cases, too.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: *Extremely* easily, but the issue has already been publicly disclosed at <https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet> and <https://twitter.com/garethheyes/status/1177296295947636737> , so there isn't much point in delaying landing.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: The same patch applies.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Relatively unlikely, since the test case in the other patch tests the relevant cases rather well. Also, if this was to regress, it would unlikely be workflow-breaking for users, since this affects rare cases. (U+0000 does not legitimately appear in HTML and especially not in these positions.)

FWIW bug that are sec-moderate or lower do not need sec-approval as per <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process>

Generally, the idea of the approval process is to prevent us from 0daying by shipping things and not making a release for a very long while. In that case, people would be able to look at the commits and attack our whole user base (since everyone is still affected).

All of this doesn't apply here: The bug is already public, we're not too afraid of people being exploited by this in the wild (and I also think this is more of a sec-low than a sec-moderate :-)). Even if they were exploited, we can't help them since the underlying bug is XSS in the web site they are visiting.

Please nominate this for Beta and ESR68 approval when you get a chance. And IMO, if this is already a publicly-disclosed issue (and the severity of it is pretty low), there doesn't seem to be much harm in landing the testcase too.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: User could become a victim of XSS on a site that does XSS filtering in a manner that is just on the right side of safe spec-wise but that doesn't use reasonable XSS filtering practices that have more security margin, such as re-serializing the input as parsed by the XSS filter. In other words, the circumstances where bad things don't happen with the patch but do happen without the patch are rather narrow.
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: This is relatively unrisky, since the test case in the other patch tests the relevant cases rather well. Also, if this was to regress, it would unlikely be workflow-breaking for users, since this affects rare cases. (U+0000 does not legitimately appear in HTML and especially not in these positions.)

(I marked "covered by automated tests" as "No", since the test hasn't landed, but a test does exist in unlanded form.)

* **String changes made/needed**: None

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: Simple security patch for a publicly-disclosed bug.
* **User impact if declined**: User could become a victim of XSS on a site that does XSS filtering in a manner that is just on the right side of safe spec-wise but that doesn't use reasonable XSS filtering practices that have more security margin, such as re-serializing the input as parsed by the XSS filter.

I agree with Ryan here: It's not likely that attackers will jump on this attack vector: It requires an XSS vulnerability in a web pages and a very particular kind of ugly band-aid on top. This attack isn't even needed for most XSS vulnerabilities. The likelihood of attackers being blocked by bad filtering is negligible.

Let's land the test.

(In reply to Ryan VanderMeulen [:RyanVM] from [comment #23](/show_bug.cgi?id=1584216#c23 "RESOLVED FIXED - Handle zero bytes after <!- and & correctly"))

> Did this test ever end up landing?

No, but the bug is still hidden, too. Should I land the test even though the bug remains hidden?

Flags: needinfo?(hsivonen) → needinfo?(ryanvm)

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

[CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-34

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in - Firefox 70

Announced
October 22, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 70

**Note:** We have updated this advisory on June 26, 2020 to include CVE-2020-12412 and on March 20, 2023 to include CVE-2019-25136, which were fixed in Firefox 70 but not recognized or acknowledged immediately.

#### [#CVE-2018-6156: Heap buffer overflow in FEC processing in WebRTC](#CVE-2018-6156)

Reporter
Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect derivation of a packet length in WebRTC caused heap corruption via a crafted video file. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1480088](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1480088)

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

##### References

* [Bug 1584907](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584907)

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When storing a value in IndexedDB, the value's prototype chain is followed and it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577107)

#### [#CVE-2019-25136: Invalid styles allowed from content processes](#CVE-2019-25136)

Reporter
Emilio Cobos Álvarez
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised child process could have injected XBL Bindings into privileged CSS rules, resulting in arbitrary code execution and a sandbox escape.

##### References

* [Bug 1530709](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530709)

#### [#CVE-2020-12412: Address bar spoof using history navigation and blocked ports](#CVE-2020-12412)

Reporter
Adrian Karolak from ING Tech Poland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By navigating a tab using the history API, an attacker could cause the address bar to display the incorrect domain (with the https:// scheme, a blocked port number such as '1', and without a lock icon) while controlling the page contents.

##### References

* [Bug 1528587](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528587)

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577953](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577953)

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1577719](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577719)

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

##### References

* [Bug 1561502](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502)

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

##### References

* [Bug 1582857](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857)

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters, enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

##### References

* [Bug 1584216](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584216)

#### [#CVE-2019-11765: Incorrect permissions could be granted to a website](#CVE-2019-11765)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process that would cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission.

##### References

* [Bug 1562582](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1562582)

#### [#CVE-2019-17000: CSP bypass using object tag with data: URI](#CVE-2019-17000)

Reporter
Yangzheng Li
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An object tag with a data URI did not correctly inherit the document's Content Security Policy. This allowed a CSP bypass in a cross-origin frame if the document's policy explicitly allowed `data:` URIs.

##### References

* [Bug 1441468](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441468)

#### [#CVE-2019-17001: CSP bypass using object tag when script-src 'none' is specified](#CVE-2019-17001)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Content-Security-Policy that blocks in-line scripts could be bypassed using an object tag to execute JavaScript in the protected document (cross-site scripting). This is a separate bypass from CVE-2019-17000.
*Note: This flaw only affected Firefox 69 and was not present in earlier versions.*

* [Bug 1587976](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1587976)

#### [#CVE-2019-17002: upgrade-insecure-requests was not being honored for links dragged and dropped](#CVE-2019-17002)

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
low
##### Description

If `upgrade-insecure-requests` was specified in the Content Security Policy, and a link was dragged and dropped from that page, the link was not upgraded to https.

#### [#CVE-2019-11764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2](#CVE-2019-11764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner

We should be using the same security checks when we try to read a property on a cross-origin object, e.g., `crossOriginWindow.open` and when we try to call a same-origin native function with a cross-origin `this` object, e.g., `window.open.call(crossOriginWindow)`. For the most part, they do behave the same, but when the objects are same-site with a document.domain difference, the latter succeeds, while the former throws a security exception.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Security regression, sort of.

So the specific testcase here is, starting with A and B same-origin windows and then changing `document.domain` in B but not A:

```
  A.alert.call(B);

```

Per spec this should throw an exception, as follows: <https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-create-operation-function> step 2.1.2.2 calls into <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage#integration-with-idl:perform-a-security-check> which for Window and Location objects checks `IsPlatformObjectSameOrigin` before allowing access. Similar for <https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-attribute-getter> step 1.1.2.2 and <https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-attribute-setter> step 4.5.2. We don't end up doing this check when A and B are same-compartment right now (we do do it if they are in different compartments).

This is a regression from [bug 1514050](/show_bug.cgi?id=1514050 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove wrapper recomputation on document.domain changes"), as far as I can tell.

[Performance testcase](attachment.cgi?id=9094354)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9094354&action=edit)

Patch coming up, but here are some numbers for this performance testcase, all in ns per property get:

* Firefox without patch, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 155 156 162 161 154
  + Bottom line: 17 17 18 18 18
* Firefox with patch, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 186 185 185 187 190
  + Bottom line: 19 18 17 18 18

For comparison, on the same hardware,

* Chrome, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 312 326 306 317 309
  + Bottom line: 220 221 230 238 226
* Safari, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 30 34 39 32 33
  + Bottom line: 31 31 44 32 31

The top line is accessing a DOM property on a window different from the one the script is running from; the botttom line is accessing it on the same window.

I am pretty sure that for the bottom line we end up on Ion fast-paths which bypass the extra code I am adding to deal with this bug, which is why there is no performance change there. For the top line, we do have a noticeable (20%) regression, but we're still a lot faster than Chrome and still a lot slower than Safari.

The profile for the post-patch case is at <https://perfht.ml/2V8Y22l> and shows 6.4% under `IsCrossOriginAccessibleObject`, 2.3% under `IsPlatformObjectSameOrigin`, and probably some of the 6% of time spent in `GenericGetter` is the inlined `IsCrossCompartmentWrapper` check. This is kinda sorta consistent with the observed ~20% slowdown: the new code I added should be no more than 16% of the total runtime of the testcase, just eyeballing the numbers. If someone can think of a sane faster way to do this, I'm all ears. But it seems like there are more wins to be had by moving more of this to the JIT somehow and avoiding the proxy overhead instead...

[Bug 1582857](/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857 "RESOLVED FIXED - DOM methods called with cross-origin this object don't handle document.domain consideration correctly"). Fix security checks around this-unwrapping. r=peterv

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: That is a good question.

The actual security impact here is that if two pages start out same-origin, but then set `document.domain` differently so that they are no longer same-origin, this bug allows calling arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window. You just have to grab the method/getter/setter from your own window, and `.call()` it, passing the other window as `this`.

How to actually exploit that, while not having the ability to just inject script into the other window before your `document.domain` values diverge, is an interesting question. And of course this only affects sites that use `document.domain` *and* depend on the no-longer-same-origin aspect of it somehow.

With all that out of the way, I think it's pretty clear based on the function naming that this has to do with security checks for "this" values of DOM methods, and that the objects involved are the ones that are normally accessible cross-origin. I suspect anyone competent would figure out that means Window and Location, and likely guess that this has to do with using those as `this` values for DOM calls, at which point they can pretty easily discover the problem. Whether they can then exploit it is an interesting question.

I could probably obfuscate the commit message some if I had to, but I am really not sure it buys us much given the way he code looks.

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: 67 and newer
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: [Bug 1514050](/show_bug.cgi?id=1514050 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove wrapper recomputation on document.domain changes")
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: I *think* this should not cause any regressions, but a bit of shaking out would be nice, especially because this patch *does* make us throw exceptions in cases where we currently don't (though other browsers do).

In discussion with Dan, we rated this a sec-moderate so this doesn't need sec-approval+ to land.

bz, sounds like you can land this in trunk now and maybe we can aim for uplift for beta 10 if the results are good.

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When following the value's prototype chain, it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11758: Potentially exploitable crash due to 360 Total Security](#CVE-2019-11758)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla community member Philipp reported a memory safety bug present in Firefox 68 when 360 Total Security was installed. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption in the accessibility engine and we presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

* [Bug 1536227](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536227)

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577953](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577953)

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1577719](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577719)

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

##### References

* [Bug 1561502](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502)

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

##### References

* [Bug 1582857](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857)

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

#### [#CVE-2019-11764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.2](#CVE-2019-11764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
