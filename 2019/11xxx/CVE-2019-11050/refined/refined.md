Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-11050:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free issue within the PHP EXIF extension, specifically during the parsing of EXIF data from an image using the `exif_read_data()` function.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use-After-Free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free condition. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory that has been previously freed. In the case of CVE-2019-11050, this happens during the parsing of EXIF information, leading to memory corruption.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The use-after-free can potentially lead to the disclosure of sensitive information stored in memory.
*   **Denial of Service (Crash):** Exploiting this vulnerability can cause the application or system to crash due to the corrupted memory access.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Image Files:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted image files containing malicious or malformed EXIF data.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply a crafted image file:** An attacker needs to provide the crafted image file to the vulnerable system that uses the php exif extension to process images. This could be done through various means, such as:
    *   Uploading the image to a web application that processes images using PHP.
    *   Tricking a user into opening the crafted file on a system running the vulnerable php extension

**Additional details from the content:**

*   **Affected versions:** PHP versions 7.2.x below 7.2.26, 7.3.x below 7.3.13 and 7.4.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:** Applying the available patches from various vendors will resolve this vulnerability.
