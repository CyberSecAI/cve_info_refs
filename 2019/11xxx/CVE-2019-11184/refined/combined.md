**arXiv:1909.04841** (cs)

# Title:Packet Chasing: Spying on Network Packets over a Cache Side-Channel

Authors:[Mohammadkazem Taram](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Taram,+M), [Ashish Venkat](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Venkat,+A), [Dean Tullsen](https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Tullsen,+D) View a PDF of the paper titled Packet Chasing: Spying on Network Packets over a Cache Side-Channel, by Mohammadkazem Taram and 2 other authors

> Abstract:This paper presents Packet Chasing, an attack on the network that does not require access to the network, and works regardless of the privilege level of the process receiving the packets. A spy process can easily probe and discover the exact cache location of each buffer used by the network driver. Even more useful, it can discover the exact sequence in which those buffers are used to receive packets. This then enables packet frequency and packet sizes to be monitored through cache side channels. This allows both covert channels between a sender and a remote spy with no access to the network, as well as direct attacks that can identify, among other things, the web page access patterns of a victim on the network. In addition to identifying the potential attack, this work proposes a software-based short-term mitigation as well as a light-weight, adaptive, cache partitioning mitigation that blocks the interference of I/O and CPU requests in the last-level cache.

### Summary:

A potential security vulnerability in some microprocessors with Intel® Data Direct I/O Technology (Intel® DDIO) and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) may allow partial information disclosure via adjacent access.

### Vulnerability Details:

CVEID: [CVE-2019-11184](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11184)

Description: A race condition in specific microprocessors using Intel (R) DDIO cache allocation and RDMA may allow an authenticated user to potentially enable partial information disclosure via adjacent access.

CVSS Base Score:  2.6 Low

CVSS Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N)

### Affected Products:

Intel® Xeon® E5, E7 and SP families that support DDIO and RDMA.

### Recommendations:

Partial information potentially disclosed through exploitation of this vulnerability could be utilized to enhance unrelated attack methods.  For published exploits that Intel is aware of, Intel recommends users follow existing best practices including:

Where DDIO & RDMA are enabled, limit direct access from untrusted networks.

The use of software modules resistant to timing attacks, using constant-time style code.
