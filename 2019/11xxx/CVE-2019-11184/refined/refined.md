Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11184:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a race condition in specific Intel microprocessors that utilize Intel Data Direct I/O Technology (Intel DDIO) and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA).
*   This race condition occurs during cache allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The core weakness is a race condition during the allocation of cache resources, specifically in systems using DDIO and RDMA.
*   **Side-Channel Vulnerability:** The race condition can be exploited via a side-channel attack by observing cache behavior, which can leak partial information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Partial Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   The information gained through this vulnerability could potentially be used to enhance other attack methods.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Adjacent Access:** The vulnerability requires an attacker to have adjacent access to the affected system. This means the attacker must be on the same physical network or have some form of direct access to the shared cache.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system.
*   **Adjacent Access:** The attacker needs to have a position that allows adjacent access to the target system's cache.
*   **Knowledge of Exploitation Techniques:** The attacker would need specific knowledge of how to exploit the race condition through cache side-channel attacks.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Intel Xeon E5, E7, and SP families that support DDIO and RDMA.
*   **Mitigations:**  The mitigations recommended include limiting direct access from untrusted networks where DDIO and RDMA are enabled and using software modules resistant to timing attacks, employing constant-time style coding practices.
*   **NetApp Products:** Certain NetApp products, such as NetApp Cloud Backup and NetApp SteelStore Cloud Integrated Storage, were affected. However, NetApp has indicated that there are no plans to address this vulnerability in these products.

**CVSS:**
*   **CVSS Score:** 2.6 (Low)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N (or CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N as seen in the Intel advisory)

**Summary of the CVSS vector:**
* **AV:A (Adjacent):** An attacker must be physically or logically adjacent to the target.
* **AC:H (High):** The attack requires a high degree of effort or specialized conditions.
* **PR:L (Low):** An attacker needs low-level privileges.
* **UI:R (Required):** User interaction is required.
* **S:C (Changed):** The vulnerability affects the confidentiality of other components within the system.
* **C:L (Low):** Limited confidentiality impact
* **I:N (None):** No impact on integrity.
* **A:N (None):** No impact on availability.

In short, this is a hardware vulnerability that can be exploited via side channel methods given the right conditions and access, potentially leading to partial information disclosure.
