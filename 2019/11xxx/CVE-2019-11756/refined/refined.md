Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11756:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper refcounting of `SFTKSession` objects within the Network Security Services (NSS) library. Specifically, the `sftk_FreeSession` function was being called on an already deallocated object due to a race condition on the refCount during destruction. When the refcount indicates that the object can be destroyed, the refcount itself is destroyed, leading to a use-after-free condition when further accesses to the session occur.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free (UAF):  The core issue is a use-after-free vulnerability, where a pointer to a session object is accessed after the memory it points to has been freed. This was happening in `sftk_FreeSession`.
- Race condition: The vulnerability is triggered due to a race condition on the refcount, where multiple threads can decrement the refcount. When the refcount reaches zero, the session object is deallocated, but other threads might still hold a pointer to it.
- Incorrect smart pointer implementation: `SFTKSession` was intended to be a smart-pointer, but it lacked the ability to track its state after deallocation, leading to uncaught UAF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Crash/Denial of Service: The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash, likely leading to a denial-of-service (DoS). The crash occurs in `sftk_FreeSession` when attempting to access a member of an already deallocated `SFTKSession` object.
- Potential for further exploitation: Although not directly demonstrated, the description notes a potential for further exploitation given the memory corruption that occurs, though it was deemed unlikely.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by conditions that involve concurrent access to session objects in NSS. Specifically, it occurs when multiple threads attempt to close or finalize a session around the same time.
- Specific scenarios may involve smart card operations, or more generally, any code that heavily uses NSS for security operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Triggering this vulnerability requires the ability to cause multiple threads to interact with `SFTKSession` objects concurrently.
- It does not appear to require specific user interaction or network access.

**Additional Details:**
- The initial analysis indicated a mutex collision, but further analysis revealed the root cause was UAF from improper refcounting.
- The `sftk_SessionFromHandle` method was identified as returning potentially invalid session objects, as the handle can outlive the session.
- The fix involves removing the refcount entirely and using the lock to govern insertion and removal of sessions from the slot, avoiding the UAF condition.
- The issue was initially considered sec-high, but was later downgraded to normal after determining there was no clear path for exploitation to achieve arbitrary code execution, though it remained a crash.
