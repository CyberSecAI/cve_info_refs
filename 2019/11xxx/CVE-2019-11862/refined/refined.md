The provided content is related to a technical bulletin (SWI-PSA-2019-004) regarding an SSH proxy vulnerability in Sierra Wireless Airlink gateways and routers. While it doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2019-11862, it discusses a security issue with similar characteristics. Therefore, we can assume that it's related to this CVE and analyze it accordingly.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The bulletin describes an SSH proxy vulnerability affecting specific Sierra Wireless AirLink gateways and routers. These devices are vulnerable when their SSH service is directly reachable from the public internet over the WAN.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The core vulnerability lies in how the SSH service on the affected devices handles connections, specifically when exposed directly to the public internet. The bulletin refers to this vulnerability as an "SSH proxy" issue.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The bulletin itself does not mention direct impacts of the vulnerability. However, given that it involves SSH access, successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the affected devices. This could potentially allow attackers to gain control of the router/gateway, modify configurations, intercept traffic, or use it as a foothold for further network attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the internet over the WAN interface via the SSH service. An attacker must be able to reach the device's SSH port directly over the internet.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to reach the device's public IP address and access the SSH service, which is exposed to the internet.
- No specific requirements regarding credentials are mentioned here, which suggests that exploitation might be possible without knowing any user credentials. However, the access gained could be limited by the specific vulnerability.
