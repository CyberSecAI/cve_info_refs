Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11236:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The `urllib3` library for Python failed to properly encode the carriage return (CR) and line feed (LF) characters (`\r\n`) within request parameters.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CRLF Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a CRLF injection. When an attacker has control over a request parameter, they can inject carriage return and line feed characters, which will be interpreted as newlines in HTTP headers

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Header Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary HTTP headers.
*   **Potential Attack on Internal Services:** If an application using `urllib3` forwards the crafted request to internal services, it could be manipulated by the injected headers to potentially compromise these services.
*   **Exposure of Credentials:**  In some instances, this vulnerability can be used to expose authorization credentials.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **Manipulated Request Parameter:** Exploitation requires the attacker to control the content of a request parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Control of Request Parameter:** The attacker needs to be able to control the content of an HTTP request parameter that is used by an application leveraging `urllib3`.
*   **Remote Access**: No specific position is required, it is a network based attack vector

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue is also related to similar CRLF injection vulnerability present in the standard Python urllib/urllib2 libraries ([CVE-2019-9740](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9740))
*   Fixes involve proper encoding of the `\r\n` sequence
*   Multiple Linux distributions and components were impacted. Red Hat, Ubuntu, Debian and openSUSE all issued advisories relating to this CVE.
*   Some content indicates that the severity could be amplified due to the fact that `urllib3` was found to be used by components in Red Hat Gluster Storage as well as other Red Hat components.
