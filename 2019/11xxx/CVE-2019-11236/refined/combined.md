RHEL Engineering is moving the tracking of its product development work on RHEL 6 through RHEL 9 to Red Hat Jira ([**issues.redhat.com**](https://issues.redhat.com)). If you're a Red Hat customer, please continue to file support cases via the [**Red Hat customer portal**](https://access.redhat.com/support/cases/). If you're not, please head to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira and file new tickets here. Individual Bugzilla bugs in the statuses "**NEW**", "**ASSIGNED**", and "**POST**" are being migrated throughout September 2023. Bugs of Red Hat partners with an assigned Engineering Partner Manager (EPM) are migrated in late September as per pre-agreed dates. Bugs against components "**kernel**", "**kernel-rt**", and "**kpatch**" are only migrated if still in "**NEW**" or "**ASSIGNED**". If you cannot log in to RH Jira, please consult [**article #7032570**](https://access.redhat.com/articles/7032570). That failing, please send an e-mail to the RH Jira admins at **rh-issues@redhat.com** to troubleshoot your issue as a user management inquiry. The email creates a ServiceNow ticket with Red Hat. Individual Bugzilla bugs that are migrated will be moved to status "**CLOSED**", resolution "**MIGRATED**", and set with "**MigratedToJIRA**" in "**Keywords**". The link to the successor Jira issue will be found under "**Links**", have a little "two-footprint" icon next to it, and direct you to the "[**RHEL project**](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/RHEL)" in Red Hat Jira (issue links are of type "**https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RHEL-XXXX**", where "**X**" is a digit). This same link will be available in a blue banner at the top of the page informing you that that bug has been migrated.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1700993#c0)  Tomas Orsava    2019-04-17 18:02:33 UTC  ``` Please add the missing `python-psycopg2-debuginfo` package into the module.   Due to an MBS bug [0], the python27 module is missing the `python-psycopg2-debuginfo`. A debuginfo packages that *is* in the module (`python2-psycopg2-debuginfo`) requires the `python-psycopg2-debuginfo` package, and thus is uninstallable.  [0] <https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/FACTORY-4297>    +++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1700386](show_bug.cgi?id=1700386 "CLOSED ERRATA - python36 module: Include missing debuginfo files caused by an MBS bug") +++  Please add the missing `python-pymongo-debuginfo` package into the module.   Due to an MBS bug [0], the python36 module is missing the `python-pymongo-debuginfo`. Two debuginfo packages that *are* in the module (`python3-pymongo-debuginfo`, `python3-bson-debuginfo`) require the `python-pymongo-debuginfo` package, and thus are uninstallable.  [0] <https://projects.engineering.redhat.com/browse/FACTORY-4297>  --- Additional comment from Tomas Orsava on 2019-04-17 19:57:59 CEST ---  After talking with RCM, I've tried to include the debuginfo package in the `api` section to get it there manually, however, this does not work, and I reverted the commit.

Package        : python-urllib3
Version        : 1.19.1-1+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2018-20060 CVE-2019-11236 CVE-2019-11324 CVE-2020-26137

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in python-urllib3, a HTTP
client for Python.

CVE-2018-20060

    Urllib3 does not remove the Authorization HTTP header when
    following a cross-origin redirect (i.e., a redirect that differs
    in host, port, or scheme). This can allow for credentials in the
    Authorization header to be exposed to unintended hosts or
    transmitted in cleartext.

CVE-2019-11236

    CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls the request
    parameter.

CVE-2019-11324

    Urllib3 mishandles certain cases where the desired set of CA
    certificates is different from the OS store of CA certificates,
    which results in SSL connections succeeding in situations where a
    verification failure is the correct outcome. This is related to
    use of the ssl_context, ca_certs, or ca_certs_dir argument.

CVE-2020-26137

    Urllib3 allows CRLF injection if the attacker controls the HTTP
    request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR and LF control
    characters in the first argument of putrequest().

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.19.1-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-urllib3 packages.

For the detailed security status of python-urllib3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-urllib3>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1702473#c0)  Pedro Sampaio    2019-04-23 21:20:29 UTC  ``` The urllib3 library before 1.24.2 for Python mishandles certain cases where the desired set of CA certificates is different from the OS store of CA certificates, which results in SSL connections succeeding in situations where a verification failure is the correct outcome.

Therefore OCP 3.11 users can mitigate this issue by not deploying and using the Curator logging feature.   In OCP 4 urllib3 is also used by several Ansible Play Book images built with the Operator SDK and available for installation in OCP 4 including openshift-enterprise-ansible-operator and ose-metering-ansible-operator. Therefore those operators should not be deployed in order to mitigate this issue in OCP 4.   ```  [Comment 36](show_bug.cgi?id=1702473#c36)  Nick Tait    2020-12-19 20:41:17 UTC  ``` Statement:  This issue did not affect the versions of python-urllib3 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, and 7 as the older code shipped there did not load the system certificates.  Red Hat Satellite 6.2 is on Maintenance Support 2 phase, hence only selected Critical and Important issues will be fixed. Please refer to Red Hat Satellite Product Life Cycle page for more information.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-urllib3 package.   ``` |  |

Package        : python-urllib3
Version        : 1.24.1-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11236 CVE-2019-11324 CVE-2020-26137 CVE-2023-43804
Debian Bug     : 927172 927412 1053626

Security vulnerabilities were found in python-urllib3, an HTTP library
with thread-safe connection pooling for Python, which could lead to
information disclosure or authorization bypass.

CVE-2019-11236

    Hanno Böck discovered that an attacker controlling the request
    parameter can inject headers by injecting CR/LF chars.  The issue is
    similar to CPython's CVE-2019-9740.

CVE-2019-11324

    Christian Heimes discovered that when verifying HTTPS connections
    upon passing an SSLContext to urllib3, system CA certificates are
    loaded into the SSLContext by default in addition to any
    manually-specified CA certificates.
    This causes TLS handshakes that should fail given only the manually
    specified certs to succeed based on system CA certs.

CVE-2020-26137

    It was discovered that CRLF injection was possible if the attacker
    controls the HTTP request method, as demonstrated by inserting CR
    and LF control characters in the first argument of putrequest().
    The issue is similar to urllib's CVE-2020-26116.

CVE-2023-43804

    It was discovered that the Cookie request header isn't stripped
    during cross-origin redirects.  It is therefore possible for a user
    specifying a Cookie header to unknowingly leak information via HTTP
    redirects to a different origin (unless the user disables redirects
    explicitly).  The issue is similar to CVE-2018-20060, but for Cookie
    request header rather than Authorization.

    Moreover “authorization” request headers were not removed
    redirecting to cross-site.  Per RFC7230 sec. 3.2 header fields are
    to be treated case-insensitively.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.24.1-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-urllib3 packages.

For the detailed security status of python-urllib3 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/python-urllib3>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1700824#c0)  Marian Rehak    2019-04-17 12:48:04 UTC  ``` The current implementation of python-urllib3 does not encode the ‘\r\n’ sequence in the query string, which allowed the attacker to manipulate a HTTP header with the ‘\r\n’ sequence in it, so the attacker could insert arbitrary content to the new line of the HTTP header.  External References: <https://bugs.python.org/issue36276>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1700824#c1)  Marian Rehak    2019-04-17 12:48:17 UTC  ``` Created python-urllib3 tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1700825](show_bug.cgi?id=1700825 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-11236 python-urllib3: CRLF injection due to not encoding the '\r\n' sequence leading to possible attack on internal service.

Red Hat Satellite 6.2 is on Maintenance Support 2 phase, hence only selected critical and important issues will be fixed. Please refer to Red Hat Satellite Product Life Cycle page for more information.  In Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13, because the flaw has a lower impact and the fix would require a substantial amount of development, no update will be provided at this time for the RHOSP python-urllib3 package.   ``` |  |

## Description

![@hannob](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/990588?v=4&size=48)[hannob](https://github.com/hannob)opened [on Mar 18, 2019](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/issues/1553#issue-422338889)

At <https://bugs.python.org/issue36276> there's an issue in Python's urllib that an attacker controlling the request parameter can inject headers by injecting CR/LF chars.

A commenter mentions that the same bug is present in urllib3:

<https://bugs.python.org/issue36276#msg337837>

So reporting it here to make sure it gets attention.

# USN-3990-1: urllib3 vulnerabilities

21 May 2019

Several security issues were fixed in urllib3.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.04](/security/notices?release=disco)
* [Ubuntu 18.10](/security/notices?release=cosmic)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)
* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [python-urllib3](/security/cves?package=python-urllib3) - HTTP library with thread-safe connection pooling for Python

## Details

It was discovered that urllib3 incorrectly removed Authorization HTTP

headers when handled cross-origin redirects. This could result in

credentials being sent to unintended hosts. This issue only affected Ubuntu

16.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.10. ([CVE-2018-20060](/security/CVE-2018-20060))

It was discovered that urllib3 incorrectly stripped certain characters from

requests. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform CRLF injection.

([CVE-2019-11236](/security/CVE-2019-11236))

It was discovered that urllib3 incorrectly handled situations where a

desired set of CA certificates were specified. This could result in

certificates being accepted by the default CA certificates contrary to

expectations. This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, Ubuntu 18.10, and

Ubuntu 19.04. ([CVE-2019-11324](/security/CVE-2019-11324))

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-9735.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-9741.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-9740 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-9740)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.16 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.7.3. CRLF injection is possible if the attacker controls a url parameter, as demonstrated by the first argument to urllib.request.urlopen with \r\n (specifically in the query string after a ? character) followed by an HTTP header or a Redis command. This is fixed in: v2.7.17, v2.7.17rc1, v2.7.18, v2.7.18rc1; v3.5.10, v3.5.10rc1, v3.5.8, v3.5.8rc1, v3.5.8rc2, v3.5.9; v3.6.10, v3.6.10rc1, v3.6.11, v3.6.11rc1, v3.6.12, v3.6.9, v3.6.9rc1; v3.7.4, v3.7.4rc1, v3.7.4rc2, v3.7.5, v3.7.5rc1, v3.7.6, v3.7.6rc1, v3.7.7, v3.7.7rc1, v3.7.8, v3.7.8rc1, v3.7.9.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.
