{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the doorGets CMS application. Specifically, the application reveals the physical path of the website files to unauthorized users due to insufficient handling of file paths.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path disclosure",
      "Lack of input validation",
       "Information leakage"
    ],
    "impact": "An unauthenticated attacker can obtain sensitive information about the server's physical path, which could potentially be used to further exploit other vulnerabilities. This information can also assist an attacker in locating and targeting specific files, leading to more severe attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the doorGets CMS, specifically by accessing URLs that leak the physical path of the site. By navigating to or manipulating specific URLs, an attacker can trigger the information disclosure.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker requires no prior authentication or specific user privileges to exploit this vulnerability. A basic understanding of HTTP requests and web application structure is sufficient to obtain the leaked path information."
