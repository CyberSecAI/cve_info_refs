{
  "CVE-2019-11761": {
    "root_cause": "By using a form with a data URI, it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unintended access to a privileged object",
      "Bypass of defense in depth mechanisms"
    ],
    "impact": "A bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms. While the impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, the ability to access the cloned privileged `JSONView` object within the content scope could potentially be leveraged for further exploitation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Using a form with a data URI"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "Ability to craft a form with a data URI. Access to the browser and the ability to interact with it. ",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs because the defense in depth mechanism against data URIs in new tabs leaves a small window of time in which a reference to a JSONView window/tab can be obtained before it is closed. The cloned JSONView object remains accessible from the window reference.",
        "affected_products": [
      "Mozilla Thunderbird",
            "Firefox"
    ]
