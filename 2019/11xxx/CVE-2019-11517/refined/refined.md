### CVE-2019-11517
The provided content is relevant to CVE-2019-11517.

- **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Affected Product:** WampServer 3.1.4-3.1.8
- **Root Cause:** The `add_vhost.php` script in the administration panel was vulnerable to CSRF. A previous attempt to fix this vulnerability in version 3.1.3 using a synchronizer pattern was not properly implemented.
- **Attack Vector:** An attacker could create a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated WampServer administrator, would send a forged request to the `add_vhost.php` script.
- **Prerequisites:** The administrator must be logged into WampServer and must not have accessed the `add_vhost.php` file in their current browser session (to avoid initialization of random tokens).
- **Impact:** An attacker could add or delete virtual hosts in the Apache configuration file.
- **Proof of Concept:** A HTML form is provided that, when submitted, attempts to expose the C:\ drive by creating a virtual host.
- **Fixed Version:** WampServer version 3.1.9 addresses this vulnerability.
