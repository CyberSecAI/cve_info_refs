Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11879:

*   **Vulnerability:** Path Traversal via Symlink in WEBrick
*   **Root Cause:** WEBrick, when serving static pages, follows symlinks. This allows an attacker to create a symlink within the served directory that points to a location outside of it.
*   **Weakness:** WEBrick doesn't restrict access to files/directories outside the intended root directory when symlinks are present.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can view sensitive data outside the intended root directory.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Create a symlink within the directory served by WEBrick that points to a sensitive location outside the intended web root.
    2.  Access the symlink via a web browser.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to create a symlink within the directory being served by WEBrick.
*   **Reproduce steps:**
    ```
    mkdir nothing
    cd nothing
    ln -s ../../ symlnk
    ruby -run -ehttpd . -p8080
    ```
