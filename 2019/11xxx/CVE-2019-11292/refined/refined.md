Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11292:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Pivotal Ops Manager logging all query parameters within Tomcat's access logs. This behavior is problematic because sensitive data, such as authentication credentials, may be transmitted as query parameters and consequently be exposed within these logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The primary weakness is the logging of query parameters, which can include sensitive information like usernames, passwords, API keys, or other authentication tokens.
*   **Logging Sensitive Information:** The application logs sensitive information which is a violation of principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Leakage:** If an attacker gains access to the Tomcat access logs, they could potentially retrieve sensitive credentials that were transmitted via query parameters.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Compromised credentials could lead to unauthorized access to the Ops Manager system or related systems managed by it.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data or configurations could be exposed due to the unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log Access:** The primary attack vector involves gaining unauthorized access to the Tomcat access log files. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
    *   Compromising the server or application where the logs are stored.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the logging infrastructure.
    *   Gaining access through insider threats.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Log Files:** An attacker needs the ability to read the Tomcat access logs where the query parameters are logged.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker must be aware of the logging behavior of the Ops Manager system to target the access logs.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Pivotal Ops Manager versions 2.4.x prior to 2.4.27
*   Pivotal Ops Manager versions 2.5.x prior to 2.5.24
*   Pivotal Ops Manager versions 2.6.x prior to 2.6.16
*   Pivotal Ops Manager versions 2.7.x prior to 2.7.5

**Mitigation:**

* Upgrade to the fixed versions of Pivotal Ops Manager: 2.4.27, 2.5.24, 2.6.16, or 2.7.5 or later
