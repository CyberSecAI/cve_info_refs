- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically related to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored XSS vulnerability in ArcSight Logger.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application. When a user views the affected page, the malicious script is executed, potentially leading to session hijacking, sensitive information disclosure, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker would need to inject malicious script via a report query object, which gets stored, and is executed when a user views it
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to create or modify a report query object, which typically requires a low level of access/privilege in the ArcSight Logger system. User interaction (viewing the report with the malicious script) is also required.
