### Acknowledgements:

Intel would like to thank Piotr Bania of Cisco TALOS (CVE-2019-14574),

SSD Secure Disclosure / Ori Nimron / @orinimron123 (CVE-2019-11112) and Rancho Han of Tencent Security ZhanluLab (CVE-2019-11111) for reporting these issues and working with us on coordinated disclosure.

The additional issues were found internally by Intel employees.  Intel would like to thank Artem Shishkin, Edgar Barbosa, Gabriel Barbosa, Gustavo Scotti, Kekai Hu, Rodrigo Axel Monroy, and Rodrigo Branco.

Intel, and nearly the entire technology industry, follows a disclosure practice called Coordinated Disclosure, under which a cybersecurity vulnerability is generally publicly disclosed only after mitigations are available.
