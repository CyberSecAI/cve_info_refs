Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-11113:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow exists in the Kernel Mode module of the Intel Graphics Driver.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer Overflow: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where a write operation attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A successful exploit could allow a privileged user to read sensitive data from memory locations they shouldn't have access to.
- Potential for other impacts are also mentioned in the CVSS score such as low confidentiality, integrity, and availability impacts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The vulnerability is exploitable through local access, meaning an attacker needs to have some level of access to the system, either physical or through other means.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Privileged User: The attacker needs to have high level privileges on the system to exploit the vulnerability.
- User interaction may be required as suggested by UI:R in the CVSS vector.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided content from Intel includes other CVEs related to Intel Graphics Driver vulnerabilities but this response focuses specifically on CVE-2019-11113.
- The NetApp document indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate Intel technology and are therefore vulnerable to CVE-2019-11113. However, NetApp has stated they do not plan to address this vulnerability in some products and has moved the status to "Won't Fix".
- The Intel document also provides recommendations to update the driver to the latest version to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
- CVSS vector indicates:
    -   AV:L (Local attack vector)
    -   AC:L (Low attack complexity)
    -   PR:H (High privileges required)
    -   UI:R (User interaction required)
    -   S:U (Scope is unchanged)
    -   C:L (Low confidentiality impact)
    -   I:L (Low integrity impact)
    -   A:L (Low availability impact)
