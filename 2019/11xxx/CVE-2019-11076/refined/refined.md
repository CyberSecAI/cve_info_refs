The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11076.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Cribl UI version 1.5.0 is vulnerable to remote command execution due to a combination of factors:
1.  **JWT Token Manipulation:** A valid JWT token can be transferred and injected into the session of another Cribl instance. Additionally, the encryption key used to generate JWT tokens can be used to create a valid session for any username with an extended expiry.
2.  **Script Execution:** The application allows users to execute scripts, which can be combined with the manipulated JWT tokens to execute arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1.  **Insecure Session Management:** The application's JWT implementation has weaknesses, allowing an attacker to forge valid authentication tokens.
2.  **Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The combination of JWT manipulation and arbitrary script execution allows an attacker to execute code without authentication, making it a remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain remote code execution on the target Cribl instance. This can lead to:
1.  **Full System Compromise:** The attacker could gain root-level access, allowing them to control the entire system.
2.  **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker could exfiltrate sensitive data from the compromised system or the network it resides on.
3. **Malware Installation:** The attacker could install malware for persistence, further compromising the host.

**Attack vectors:**
1.  **Web Request:** The attack is initiated by sending malicious web requests to the Cribl server.
2.  **JWT Manipulation:**  The attacker manipulates the JWT token to gain unauthorized access, enabling the attacker to execute commands on the vulnerable system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Network access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cribl instance to send HTTP requests.
2.  **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the JWT tokens are created and how to exploit the script execution feature.
