  "cve": "CVE-2019-11675",
  "description": "The groonga-httpd package 6.1.5-1 for Debian sets the /var/log/groonga ownership to the groonga account, which might let local users obtain root access because of unsafe interaction with logrotate. For example, an attacker can exploit a race condition to insert a symlink from /var/log/groonga/httpd to /etc/bash_completion.d. NOTE: this is an issue in the Debian packaging of the Groonga HTTP server.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insecure use of logrotate due to the path of the log directory of groonga-httpd being manipulatable by the user 'groonga'.",
    "weakness": "The /var/log/groonga directory is owned by the groonga user, allowing manipulation of the log directory.",
    "impact": "Privilege escalation to root.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to be the 'groonga' user.",
    "steps": [
      "User 'groonga' replaces the directory /var/log/groonga/httpd with a symbolic link to a sensitive directory (e.g., /etc/bash_completion.d).",
      "logrotate places log files AS ROOT into the directory pointed to by the symlink (e.g., /etc/bash_completion.d) and sets the owner and group to 'groonga.groonga'.",
      "Attacker places a reverse-shell into the created file.",
      "When root logs in, the reverse shell is executed."
    ],
    "mitigation": "Mitigation involves changing the owner and group of /var/log/groonga to root, or by using the 'su' option inside the logrotate configuration file."
