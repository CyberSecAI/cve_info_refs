Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-11876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user inputs during the installation process of both Drupal and PrestaShop CMS. Specifically, error messages in Drupal and the `shop_country` parameter in PrestaShop were not properly sanitized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Both Drupal and PrestaShop were vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks during the installation process. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page that is displayed to the victim.
    *   **Drupal:**  HTML injection was possible by injecting `<a>` and `<div>` tags into error messages. It was also possible to load external resources using an `<img>` tag.
    *   **PrestaShop:** XSS payloads worked on the `shop_country` parameter in a GET request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Drupal:**
    *   The attacker can manipulate the website look via HTML code injection.
    *   The attacker can steal user credentials by redirecting the user to a malicious page.
    *   The attacker can force a user to load external malicious scripts and frames.
*   **PrestaShop:**
    *   The attacker could inject malicious scripts and potentially steal user data, redirect the user to a malicious website or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Drupal:**
    *   By manipulating the "driver" parameter in a POST request during installation, an attacker can inject HTML.
    *   By injecting `<img>` tag with a malicious external resource.
*   **PrestaShop:**
    *   By crafting a malicious link with an XSS payload in the `shop_country` GET parameter during the initial setup.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the parameters in HTTP requests during the initial setup stage of the CMS installation.
*   In the case of PrestaShop, the attacker needs to trick the user into following the initial steps of the setup (accepting terms and conditions) before executing a malicious link.
*   No special privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was found during a security assessment that specifically looked at the installation phase of the CMS.
*   PrestaShop acknowledged and addressed the vulnerability in version 1.7.6.
*   Drupal did not acknowledge the vulnerability.
*   The article emphasizes the importance of a well-defined test scope to identify vulnerabilities often overlooked by standard security checks.
