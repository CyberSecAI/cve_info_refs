Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Cloud Controller API (CAPI) in version 1.88.0 incorrectly allowed space developers to list all global service brokers. This was due to a lack of proper access controls on the API endpoint used to retrieve service broker information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability allowed space developers to access sensitive information such as service broker URLs and GUIDs which are intended to be restricted to administrators. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** Space developers, who should only have access to resources within their space, could enumerate all service brokers in the system.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** Disclosure of service broker URLs and GUIDs could potentially be used as a stepping stone for more sophisticated attacks, although the content does not describe the direct implications.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated space developer through the Cloud Controller API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a space developer with an account on the affected Cloud Foundry deployment.
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the Cloud Controller API.

**Summary**
The vulnerability is an information disclosure issue due to improper access controls in Cloud Foundry's CAPI, allowing space developers to list all service brokers including URLs and GUIDs which are meant for admin access only. This issue is resolved by upgrading CAPI to version 1.89.0 or greater and CF Deployment to v12.17.0 or greater.
