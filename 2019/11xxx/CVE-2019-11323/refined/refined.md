- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A security issue in the TLS ticket key rotation. When HAProxy was reloaded with rotated keys, the resumption would be broken for previous encryption key.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken TLS session resumption due to incorrect handling of rotated keys.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Clients would be unable to resume previous TLS sessions, potentially leading to performance degradation and increased latency due to full TLS handshakes being required.
- **Attack vectors**: Reloading HAProxy with rotated TLS ticket keys.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to be able to trigger a reload of HAProxy, with rotated keys. This is typically an administrative function.
