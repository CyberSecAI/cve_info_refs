The provided content relates to CVE-2019-11812.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user-provided input when handling links in discussion posts. Specifically, the `CommandHelper.php` file in MISP was not properly validating URLs, allowing for the injection of `javascript://` URLs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a persistent XSS vulnerability. By crafting a malicious link using `javascript://`, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that will be executed when a user clicks on the link.
- **Insufficient URL Validation:** The code uses `filter_var` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_URL`, but it doesn't prevent `javascript://` style URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser when they interact with a malicious link in a discussion. This can lead to:
    - Stealing user cookies/session information.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim, including modification of data.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    - Other arbitrary actions limited to the user's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Link Injection:** An attacker would need to insert a link in a discussion post, using `javascript://` as the URL protocol, for example  `javascript:alert('XSS')`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to create discussion posts in the MISP application.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges other than those needed to create discussion posts.
