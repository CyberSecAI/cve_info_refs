Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-11818 (Based on the email content, it's implied this CVE is for the reported issue)

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient input sanitization in the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields when creating a new user within the Alkacon OpenCMS system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating a new user, specifically within the first and last name fields. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the system's database.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** The injected JavaScript payload will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when user information is displayed, such as user confirmation, user list, or user view pages.
- **Session Hijacking/Cookie Theft:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information associated with the application, leading to unauthorized access and control.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User Input Injection:** The attack vector is through the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields in the "New User" creation form within the admin interface of OpenCMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the OpenCMS administration panel or be able to create a new user via a different method.
- The attacker must be able to insert the malicious JavaScript payload into the "First Name" and "Last Name" fields during user creation.

**Additional Details:**

- **Vulnerable Software:** Alkacon OpenCMS version v10.5.4 and prior.
- **Specific Payload:** The provided example payload is: `TestXSS<img+src=x+onmouseover=alert(document.domain)>`
- **Affected URL:** http://[your_webserver_ip]/opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/user_new.jsp
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability because the malicious code is stored and later rendered on the page.
