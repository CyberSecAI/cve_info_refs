Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11584:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `MigratePriorityScheme` resource of Jira.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically located within the "priority icon URL" of an issue priority.
*   The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied data that is used to construct this URL which allows attackers to inject malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the application's web page.
*   This could lead to a variety of impacts, such as:
    *   Data theft (session hijacking, stealing of user information, etc)
    *   Defacement of web pages
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Execution of malicious code on the victim's browser
    *   Other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the `MigratePriorityScheme` resource.
*   Attackers can inject malicious code by manipulating the priority icon URL associated with an issue priority.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to interact with the `MigratePriorityScheme` resource and modify the priority icon URL. This might require the attacker to have some level of access or permissions within the Jira instance to modify issue priorities. The exact required position is not clear, more information regarding the access control of the resource would be needed.
*   The attacker can be remote, meaning they don't need to be on the same network as the vulnerable Jira server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" priority with "Severity 2 - Major" symptom severity.
* The vulnerability affects versions 7.13.3 and 8.0.2.
* Fixes are available in versions 7.13.13, 8.3.2, and 8.4.0.
* The vulnerability was introduced in version 7.13.
