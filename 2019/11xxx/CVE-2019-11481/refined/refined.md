  "cve": "CVE-2019-11481",
  "description": "Apport would read its user-controlled settings file as the root user. This could be used by a local attacker to possibly crash Apport or have other unspecified consequences.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Apport reads its user-controlled settings file (~/.config/apport/settings) as the root user.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Apport reads user-controlled settings file with elevated privileges.",
        "If the settings file is a symlink, it can lead to arbitrary file reads."
    ],
    "impact": "A local attacker could potentially crash Apport or cause other unspecified consequences due to the ability to control the content of the settings file.",
    "attack_vector": "Local access.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create and modify the  ~/.config/apport/settings file, which if made as a symlink, can lead to arbitrary file reads."
