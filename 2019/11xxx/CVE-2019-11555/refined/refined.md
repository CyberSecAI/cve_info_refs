Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11555:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper validation of the fragmentation reassembly state within the EAP-pwd implementation of `hostapd` (EAP server) and `wpa_supplicant` (EAP peer). Specifically, both implementations fail to handle unexpected fragments correctly, leading to potential issues during the reassembly process of EAP messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Fragmentation Reassembly:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation during the reassembly of fragmented EAP-pwd messages. This allows for an attacker to send unexpected fragments, which bypass the reassembly logic in `hostapd` and `wpa_supplicant`.
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** This reassembly issue can lead to a NULL pointer dereference, causing the `hostapd` or `wpa_supplicant` processes to terminate abruptly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can force the termination of the `hostapd` or `wpa_supplicant` processes. This results in a denial of service, effectively disrupting network access and authentication.
*   **Potential Network Disruption:** The denial of service can impact wireless clients attempting to connect to the network or access points providing wireless services.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Wireless Communication:** An attacker within radio range can target devices running vulnerable versions of `hostapd` or `wpa_supplicant`.
*  **EAP-pwd Specific:** The vulnerability is specific to EAP-pwd authentication.
*   **Crafted EAP Messages:** The attack vector involves constructing and sending a specific sequence of EAP-pwd messages containing unexpected fragments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Radio Proximity:** The attacker must be within radio range of a target station with `wpa_supplicant` or an access point running `hostapd`.
*   **EAP-pwd Enabled:** The target system must be configured to use EAP-pwd for authentication.
*  **EAP Message Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to send manipulated EAP messages.

**Summary of Key Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in both `hostapd` (access point) and `wpa_supplicant` (client).
*   It is specific to the EAP-pwd authentication method.
*   Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service by crashing the affected daemons.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by an improper reassembly of fragmented EAP-pwd messages.
*   Patches are available for `wpa_supplicant/hostapd` v2.8 or newer.
