Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11733:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient protection of stored passwords within the 'Saved Logins' feature of Mozilla Firefox. Specifically, when a master password is set, it was intended to require re-entry before accessing stored passwords. However, the 'copy password' context menu item allowed copying passwords to the clipboard without requiring master password re-entry if the password had been entered earlier in the same session. This bypasses the intended protection of stored passwords.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access control for copying passwords. The copy action was not adequately protected by the master password check, allowing for unauthorized access if a master password was entered in the same session.
*   **Logic Error:** The root cause is a logic error where the password copy function failed to re-invoke the master password authentication. The `masterPasswordLogin()` function was called as an async function but its result was not awaited when copying a password to the clipboard.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker could steal locally stored passwords by using the "copy password" context menu without the need to re-authenticate with the master password. This could allow the attacker to gain access to a user's online accounts, leading to a range of impacts from account compromise to identity theft.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local system access, making it more feasible for an attacker who has gained some level of access to a user's computer. An attacker would need to be on the system where the browser is installed, or gain access to the system, in order to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **User Session:** The attacker could steal credentials if a master password was entered earlier in the session and the user left their computer unlocked or unattended.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local system access:** The attacker must have some form of access to the computer running the vulnerable version of Firefox. This could involve physical access to the machine or remote access gained through other means.
*   **Prior Master Password Entry:** The attacker must leverage an active browser session where the user has previously entered their master password. If no master password has been entered or an attacker is using a new browser session, this vulnerability would not be exploitable.
*   **Basic Firefox knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of Firefox's context menu in the saved login section.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Firefox versions prior to 68.0.2 and Firefox ESR versions prior to 68.0.2.
*   The fix implemented involves making the `CopyPassword` function `async` and awaiting the result of the `masterPasswordLogin()` function before copying a password.
*   This issue is rated as a **moderate severity** issue, but can have **critical** impact for users who utilize the master password to protect their stored passwords.
