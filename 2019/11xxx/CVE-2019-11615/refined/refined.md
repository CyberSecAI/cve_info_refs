Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2019-11615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission verification and filtering in the `upload.php` file within the `fileman` directory of doorGets CMS v7.0. Specifically, the application fails to adequately sanitize the upload path, allowing for directory traversal. Additionally, the application relies on a configuration file (`admin.json`) to dictate allowed file types, which can be manipulated via a prior arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in conjunction with the file upload vulnerability, leading to arbitrary file uploads.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The core vulnerability is the ability to upload arbitrary files to the server, including malicious ones like PHP backdoors.
*   **Path Traversal:** The lack of proper path sanitization in the `upload.php` script allows attackers to bypass directory restrictions and place files outside the intended upload folder.
*   **Configuration File Manipulation:** The vulnerability leverages an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability to delete the `admin.json` file, which dictates allowed file types and enables modifying `admin.json` to remove restrictions.
*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The file upload functionality lacks sufficient permission checks, allowing any logged-in user to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** By uploading a PHP backdoor, an attacker can gain complete control over the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Website Defacement:** The attacker can modify website content or inject malicious scripts.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker could use the compromised server as a launching point for further attacks on internal networks or other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted POST requests to the `upload.php` script, leveraging the path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Multipart/form-data:** The attacker uses `multipart/form-data` to upload files.
*   **Chained Vulnerability Exploitation:**  The attacker exploits an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability first, to remove the `admin.json` config file and then uploads a modified version of the config using the upload vulnerability. This sets the stage for a subsequent arbitrary .php file upload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
*   **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the doorGets CMS.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable `upload.php` file location.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to create HTTP requests containing the required parameters for path traversal.
*   **Knowledge of Chained Exploitation:** The attacker needs to know how to use the file deletion vulnerability to set up the arbitrary file upload.
