  grouping tabs on an attribute (instead of sub OQLs)

* Include Archived data in dashlets when in archived
  mode
### Others

* New configuration parameter
  (disable\_attachments\_download\_legacy\_portal) to disable attachments
  download from the legacy portal. Default is “true”!
* Setup : add checks on PHP and MySQL version to warn
  for deprecated versions.
* Enable data synchronization for applications
  classes (such as Localized Data).
* Fixed losing the additional links attributes values
  during impact analysis update. The issue was only visible when
  attributes were added to the links (FunctionalCIs and
  Contacts).
* Fix impact analysis relation upstream
  description.
* Show “delete” and “bulk delete” rights in user's
  grant matrix.
* New Context Tag on CRON background tasks.
* Fix TemplateFieldsHandler::IsNull() for
  EmailNotification with no RequestTemplate selected.
* Add ArchivedObjectException on
  MetaModel:GetObject().
* Add ContextTag on CRON background tasks (eg.
  “CRON:Task:<CLASS\_NAME\_OF\_THE\_CURRENT\_TASK>”). Introduced for
  the “Mail to ticket automation” extension, so we know when a Ticket
  is created/updated from an email.“
* Regression introduced in iTop 2.4 : Unable to
  notify when a template was used with a linkset
  ($this→functionalcis\_list$).
* Fix regression in 2.4.0 where GET\_LOCK is called
  with a name length greater than 64 characters on MySQL >
  5.7.5.
* Fixed “Notice: undefined index 0” in the portal.
  UserRequest/Incident::ComputePriority() was failing when attributes
  impact was still undefined.
### Backup

* Fix Backup very long to generate.
* PHAR is not used anymore for the backup/restore
  feature.
* The disk space necessary to create a backup is now
  limited to the size of the uncompressed archive + the size of the
  compressed archive.
* All the temporary files are now stored into
  ”“web/data/backup/tmp”“ folder to avoid access rights issues on
  temporary folders.
* Fixed check\_backup reporting non existing
  file.
* More logs added in case of error during the cron
  backup.”
* Fix regression: check\_backup.php always returning
  “missing backup file” in 2.4.0.
## 2.4.0

### Lifecycle

* New Ticket Lifecycle: Enable a field to be
  requested or changed only on a particular transition, instead of on
  all transitions ending on a given state.
* Move the “must\_change” flag on transitions if you
  don't want the user to be forced to change a field on every edition
  in a state.
* Display stimulus codes in the Datamodel page
  tab:Lifecycle
* Fix Fatal error on transition with AttributeBlob or
  AttributeCaseLog
### CSV import

* Images and File documents can now be exported using
  CSV and Excel formats (the export provides an URL (with iTop authentication
  required) where to download the actual image/document).
* CSV import of documents and images via URLs is
  supported (including URLs pointing to iTop itself). Administrators
  can also provide directly the path to a local file on the
  server.“
* CSV Import now supports friendlynames as
  reconciliation keys.
* Enable CSV import of request template fields
* Fix: Ticket from emails: duplicated dictionary
  entries which was an issue on CSV import.
### Notification

* Email notification: new placeholder to provide the
  current user name in the body of the email, so the person who is
  triggering the notification who may not be the agent nor the
  caller.
* Fix Notification: Date & time format is now applied
  when using a date(time) attribute in a placeholder (eg.
  Notifications). Note: $this→raw(attcode)$ can be used to display
  value in SQL format like before.
### Conf & Setup

* New configuration parameter 'allow\_menu\_on\_linkset'
  (boolean, default value false) to display actions in linkset in
  view mode (new, modify, delete, …).
* Setup: After a succesfull Setup, XML files are
  stored under /data with the complete view of the datamodel with and
  without delta.
* Setup: Store user selection on setup, so AboutBox
  is much clearer for users, providing User selection instead of
  cryptic module names.
* Setup: supports now changes of Configuration
  parameter: config db\_charset.
* Setup: New hook available after data load
  (ModuleInstaller::AfterDataLoad())
### Backup

* Backup: Backup files could not exceed 4Gb
  (technology limitation). The fix consists in archiving the backup
  as a tar.gz instead of a zip. As a consequence, installing iTop now
  requires TWO additional PHP modules: phar/zlib. The zip module
  remains mandatory because it is used in other places. The restore
  utility accepts both legacy zip files and brand new tar.gz files.
  DBBackup::CreateZip is deprecated in favor of
  DBBackup::CreateCompressedBackup. DBRestore::RestoreFromZip is
  deprecated in favor of DBRestore::RestoreFromCompressedFile (which
  autodetects the format for backward compatibility).
* Backup: Allow database write access during a backup
  (can still be slow).
### Performances

* Support of PHP7, which divides by two the load on
  the web server
* Internal emulation of apc(u), to divide by 5 the
  load on the web server (varies a lot, depending on the page, and
  cache hit ratio)
### DataSynchro

* DataSynchro: Enable bulk deletion of Data Synchro
  Replica
* DataSynchro: Creation and edition was broken due to
  the new object set API from ormLinkSet.
  Backward compatible method have been introduce to ensure plugins
  and modules compatibility. That being said they are already flagged
  as deprecated and should not be used. New: Using those deprecated
  methods will raise a PHP deprecated error.
### Internal

* Security: Portal OpenSans font embedded in iTop
  instead of fetching from google servers.

* Rework on ormLinkSet BC with DBObjectSet. PHP
  notice are not thrown anymore, see PHPDoc instead.
  GetColumnAsArray() introduced.
* Portal: Refactoring of const DEFAULT\_COUNT\_PER\_PAGE
  in several modules
* Reentrance issue on cmdbAbstractObject when coming
  from an extension implementing iApplicationObjectExtension.
* Added an index to prevent a slow down when a lot of
  tickets have been validated by the mean of an approval
  process
* Designer Connector has been revamped to avoid MTP
  temporary errors, diseappearing at the following Setup.
* #1499: Regression in 2.4.0 beta: setup was failing
  with the message “cannot redeclare class XXXXXXX\_0” when loading
  some extensions modules.
* Fix: PHP Warning on not initialized variable
  $sHTMLValue in cmdbAbstractObject::GetFormElementForField().
### Developpers

* The main menu “Helpdesk” could not be moved
  upward/downward by the mean of an XML delta (designer)
* Internal: LoginWebPage title defaultvalue is now a
  dictionary entry ('UI:Login:Title')
* Limitation: an a class having too many external
  keys, the update query fails with message “too many tables”
* Cleaned up old datamodel (1.x) as it was no longer
  maintained and could not be upgraded.
* Show product name on branding logo title instead of
  a generic “iTop” text.
### Portal possibilities

* Allowed portals are now displayed in the console
  user menu.
* Portal: New “mosaic” browse mode for
  BrowseBrick.
* Portal: Form layout optimizations
* Portal: ExternalField support in forms has been
  improved. For example, email and url links were not displayed as
  proper HTML.
* Portal: Only editable fields are now passed in
  forms submit, fixing issue where a portal user could unwillingly
  change the UserRequest status if a Support Agent had assign the
  ticket while the portal user was editing.
* Portal: New filter brick that pre-filters a Browse
  or Manage brick results from the home page.
* Portal: Linkset widget opening was throwing a
  warning message on IE9.
* Portal: ExternalField support in forms has been
  improved. For example, email and url links were not displayed as
  proper HTML.
* Portal: Option to display LinkedSet as opened in a
  form
* Portal: Picture/Preferences/Password forms can now
  be disabled in the user profile
* Portal: Notification URLs poiting to a portal were
  not working when several portal instances were configured.
* Portal: Tabs in ManageBrick display the objects
  count.
* Portal: Autocomplete fields were not showing all
  items when result count was below autocomplete display limit (eg.
  Showing only 2 elements out of 18 when display limit set to
  20)
* Portal: Added UI extension APIs similar to those
  used in the console (Experimental!)
* Portal: ManageBrick tabs could show objects that
  were not supposed to be shown due to a bad OQL
  interpretation.
* Portal: Display / download of blob attributes and
  attachments in the portal was not compatible with portal
  configuration and silos by-passing.
### Console User Interface

* Improve UI in object details in the console.
* CKEditor: edition of HTML source code is now
  available. Filtering on allowed tags by CKEditor himself then by
  iTop for security reasons will still apply.
* Added some attributes to the HTML sanitizer (title for a tag,
  alt / title for img tag).
* Display actions on linkset in view mode (new,
  modify, delete, …).
* New option to create an object with the [+] button
  on external key pointing to an abstract class.
* Existing value always kept while editing an
  ExternalKey field, even if not in filter.
* Showing action in object details only when the
  target class is writable (Archive mode off, access mode “write”,
  …)
* Impact analysis: UI Glitch in tooltip when text was
  too long.
* Fixed UI in console edit forms that were going over
  their container sometimes.
* Added scrollbars to modal dialog for CSV
  export.
* Fix Stop displaying Ticket objects in a CI's
  ongoing tickets tab when the impact code is 'not impacted'.
* Fix: Edition of an object with an ExternalKey on an
  object that the user is not allowed to see
* Fix: concurrent access on n:n relationships when
  edited from both end of the relation or when edited from portal and
  console in parallel.
* Fix: Date format handling in LinkedSetIndirect was
  causing fatal error on object edition.
* Fix: Edition of an object with not allowed (silos)
  remote objects in a linkedset causes fatal error.
* Fix: Hierarchy button when editing external
  key
