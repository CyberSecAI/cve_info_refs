  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2019-11396",
      "root_cause": "Permissive access rights on the SoftwareUpdater folder are incompatible with the privileged file manipulation performed by the product.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper Access Control (CWE-284)"
      ],
       "impact": "An unprivileged user could obtain SYSTEM privileges by exploiting arbitrary file writes.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An unprivileged user can create symbolic links to arbitrary files and replace files used by the Software Updater (e.g., SwuConfig.json). When an update occurs, a privileged service creates a file and sets its access rights, offering write access to the Everyone group in any directory.",
     "more_info": "Arbitrary file creation can be achieved by abusing the SwuConfig.json file creation."
