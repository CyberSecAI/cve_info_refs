  "CVE-2019-11747": {
    "description": "The \"Forget about this site\" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The \"Forget about this site\" functionality incorrectly removes preloaded HSTS settings, not just those learned dynamically.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect handling of preloaded HSTS settings"
      ],
      "impact": "A user can be temporarily downgraded from HTTPS to HTTP for a preloaded HSTS site if they use the \"Forget about this site\" feature, exposing them to potential man-in-the-middle attacks.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "User interaction is required (using the Forget about this site feature)."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a site over HTTP after using \"Forget about this site\". The attacker can then perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the HTTP connection."
    }
