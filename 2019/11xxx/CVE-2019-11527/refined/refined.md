CVE-2019-11527
```

- **Root Cause:** A cgi script of the uaGate SI handles its parameters in an unsafe fashion. Maliciously crafted URL parameters can transfer an arbitrary command payload.
- **Vulnerability:** Unsafe handling of URL parameters in a CGI script allows for arbitrary command execution.
- **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands by issuing a specially crafted web request.
- **Impact:** An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands with the rights of the webserver. The command output is returned in the webserver's response. This can lead to complete control over the target device when combined with a privilege escalation vulnerability.
- **Required Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be authenticated.
