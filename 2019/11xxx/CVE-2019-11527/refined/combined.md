# mioso - IT Security: Certified pentest provider from Hamburg

mioso - IT Security is a brand of [mioso - IT Solutions Gmbh & Co. KG](https://www.mioso.com/). The Hamburg-based company mioso - IT Solutions Gmbh & Co. KG was founded in 1997 and has developed from a one-man operation into a service provider with around 30 employees. Starting out as an IT system house, mioso - IT Solutions has become increasingly specialised in IT security solutions, resulting in the mioso - IT Security brand.

What makes us unique is our dual expertise as a certified pentest provider and experienced IT system house. This combination enables us to offer you not only well-founded security analyses, but also customised recommendations for your IT infrastructure.

## Our unique selling point

Deep insights and comprehensive understanding: Our work as an IT system house gives us valuable insights into the daily challenges and requirements of modern IT infrastructures. We understand the pain points and working methods of companies because we develop, implement and maintain IT solutions ourselves. This experience flows directly into our penetration tests and enables us not only to identify security gaps, but also to make practical and realisable recommendations.

## Advantages of our dual role

Our customers benefit from our unique combination of pentesting expertise and IT system house experience. Our holistic approach has not only enabled us to close security gaps, but also to improve the IT performance and efficiency of numerous companies. Our recommendations are not only well-founded in terms of security technology, but can also be implemented in practice. We take into account the real conditions and requirements of your company.

The IT security team of the certified provider mioso - IT Solutions consists of members of a broad hacker community that is committed to digital security. Together, the team members have more than 80 years of experience in the IT security industry.

Our goal is to improve the IT security of our customers - even if it can be unpleasant. We may therefore advise potential customers against desired products if we think that they are not sustainable or effective. We always act in the best interests of our customers, even if this is less lucrative or exciting for us.

## Pentest from Hamburg for companies: professional and independent

This experience shows that every customer has different requirements for their IT security. That's why we address all requirements individually and work together to find the optimal solution for your needs.

We can prove the security standards and quality of our work with certificates. We are certified in accordance with ISO 27001 (standard for information security management systems) and ISO 9001 (quality management standard).
