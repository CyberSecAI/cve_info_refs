Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2019-11539:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/dana-admin/diag/diag.cgi` script, specifically within the `tcpdump_options_syntax_check` function. This function takes user-provided input (the `options` parameter) and directly incorporates it into a `system()` call without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The lack of input sanitization in the `tcpdump_options_syntax_check` function allows an attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the Pulse Secure appliance with the privileges of the web server.
*   **System Compromise:** This RCE can lead to complete compromise of the VPN server, allowing the attacker to perform a variety of malicious activities, such as stealing sensitive data, installing backdoors, or using the compromised system as a pivot point for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is accessible through the administrative web interface of the Pulse Secure appliance via the `/dana-admin/diag/diag.cgi` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have authenticated access to the administrative web interface of the Pulse Secure appliance.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to target the `options` parameter within the `/dana-admin/diag/diag.cgi` script.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Bypass of Protections:** Pulse Secure implements a Perl module called `DSSAFE.pm` to hook potentially dangerous Perl functions like `system` and restrict command execution. However, the researchers discovered a way to bypass the checks using incomplete I/O redirection and a clever trick of using the error message of `tcpdump` command to inject Perl code through `STDERR`, which was then redirected to a cache directory.
*   **Exploitation Chain:** The command injection vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities for a full compromise scenario, as demonstrated by the researchers in a case study involving Twitter.

**In summary, CVE-2019-11539 is a critical vulnerability that allows authenticated administrators to achieve remote command execution on Pulse Secure appliances through command injection. This is made possible due to insufficient input sanitization in the diag.cgi script. Attackers can use this vulnerability to take over the system.**
