Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11611:

**CVE-2019-11611:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists in the `download.php` file within the `/fileman/php/` directory of doorGets CMS v7.0. The script directly includes the value from the GET parameter `f` into a file path without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weakness:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation and sanitization on the `f` parameter in `download.php`. This allows an attacker to specify an arbitrary file path to be downloaded from the server.
*   **Impact:** A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain server-sensitive information by downloading arbitrary files from the server file system. This could lead to disclosure of configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request to `/fileman/php/download.php`
    *   The attacker can specify an arbitrary file path through the `f` parameter.
    *   Example: `http://domain.com/fileman/php/download.php?f=/fileman/Uploads/../../config/config.php`
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker requires network access to the server hosting the vulnerable doorGets CMS.
    *   The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
    *   The attacker only needs to be able to send an HTTP GET request.
