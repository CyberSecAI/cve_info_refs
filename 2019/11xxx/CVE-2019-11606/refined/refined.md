The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in DoorGets CMS version 7.0. Here's the breakdown for CVE-2019-11606:

**CVE-2019-11606**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The `copyfile.php` script in the file manager lacks proper permission checks and input sanitization. Specifically, the values of `$newPath` and `$path` are not filtered, allowing for arbitrary file copying across directories.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    *   **Insufficient access control:** The script does not verify if the user has the permission to perform the file copy operation.
    *   **Path Traversal:** The script doesn't properly sanitize or validate the input paths, allowing attackers to specify source and destination paths outside the intended directory structure.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Sensitive information disclosure:** An unauthenticated attacker can copy sensitive files, such as configuration files, to a publicly accessible location and thus expose their content.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   A remote, unauthenticated attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to `/fileman/php/copyfile.php`. The request includes parameters `f` (source file) and `n` (destination path), which are manipulated to point to the desired source and destination file locations.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server, no authentication is required.

In the provided example, the attacker copies the Apache configuration file (`httpd.conf`) to the webroot, making it accessible via a direct URL. This allows the attacker to obtain sensitive server configuration information.
