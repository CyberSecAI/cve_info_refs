Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of file type restrictions in the "Documents" area of the GAT-Ship Web Module. Specifically, the "uploadDocFile.aspx" component allows users to upload files without proper validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted File Upload: The primary weakness is the absence of file type checks, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The ability to upload arbitrary file types could lead to various impacts, including:
    - **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  An attacker could upload malicious code (e.g., a web shell) and execute it on the server.
    - **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** Upload malicious files to compromise the system.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Upload large or malicious files to cause system instability.
- The content mentions the vulnerability allows "authenticated attackers" to upload any file type, suggesting that attackers would need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the GAT-Ship Web Module, specifically the "Documents" section where file uploads are handled.
- Attackers interact with the `uploadDocFile.aspx` component to upload malicious files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have valid user credentials for the GAT-Ship Web Module. This indicates the vulnerability is not exploitable by unauthenticated users.
- The attacker would need to be able to access the vulnerable web interface.

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability affects all versions of the GAT-Ship Web Module prior to version 1.40.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Gionathan Reale.
- The fix for this vulnerability is to upgrade to version 1.40 or later.
