Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The file modification functionality in the Gila CMS backend lacks token verification, leading to a CSRF vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The application doesn't validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user. Specifically, the `/fm/save` endpoint for file modification is vulnerable.
- **Lack of token validation:** Absence of CSRF protection mechanisms like tokens makes the application susceptible to CSRF attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Modification/GetShell:** An attacker can inject arbitrary PHP code into existing files (e.g. index.php) allowing them to execute code on the server. This leads to a complete compromise of the webserver by achieving remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious Webpage:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable endpoint (`/fm/save`) within the Gila CMS application.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker lures a logged-in administrator user to visit the malicious HTML page, triggering the CSRF attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs no specific access to the Gila CMS application, other than being able to get a victim to load the malicious html file in their browser while they are logged into the Gila CMS application.
- They don't need to know the file path they are modifying, as they can specify it in the request (`index.php` is used as an example).
- The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable Gila CMS instance.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided exploit code injects php code into the `index.php` file and calls phpinfo() to confirm code execution.
- The vulnerability exists in the `/src/core/controllers/fm.php` file.
- The vulnerable parameter is `contents` in a POST request to the `/fm/save` endpoint.
