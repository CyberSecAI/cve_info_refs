Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11923:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The deprecated ASCII parser in Mcrouter would allocate a buffer to a user-specified length without enforcing a maximum length.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unbounded memory allocation: The parser did not limit the size of the buffer allocated based on user input. This could lead to excessive memory usage.
- Resource exhaustion: The unbounded memory allocation could lead to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: An attacker could cause the service to crash or become unresponsive by providing a large value for the buffer size, leading to resource exhaustion and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted network packets: An attacker could send a specially crafted request with a large value for the buffer size to trigger the vulnerability. This could be done remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send network requests to the vulnerable Mcrouter instance.

**Additional details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability, implemented in commit `98ce6624cd2563cfdb5da3b2949d5e1e03867034`, introduced a maximum value size limit (1GB) to prevent excessive memory allocation.
- The vulnerability affects Mcrouter versions prior to v0.41.0.
- The vulnerability is related to the deprecated ASCII parser.
- The provided information clarifies the root cause of the vulnerability more clearly than the generic CVE description, detailing the lack of a maximum length check on a user specified buffer length.
