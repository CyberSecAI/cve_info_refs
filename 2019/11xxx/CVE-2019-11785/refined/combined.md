## Description

![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63710#issue-773033517)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2019-11785](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-77f7-r2cc-pcqm "CVE-2019-11785")

**Affects**: Odoo 13.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2019-11785](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11785)

**Component**: Discuss

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz)

Improper access control in mail module (followers) in Odoo Community 13.0

and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 13.0 and earlier, allows remote

authenticated users to obtain access to messages posted on business records

there were not given access to, and subscribe to receive future messages.

## I. Background

The Discuss application provides generic productivity components to other Odoo

Apps, including a system allowing users to create private or public discussion

channels. This system allows to two users to chat together.

## II. Problem Description

A missing access control allowed unauthorized users to become followers

of arbitrary database records.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: User account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.5

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

A malicious external user who has been granted Portal access could

send a specially crafted request to become follower of an arbitrary

database records, which would let them read past private discussions

on the document, and receive future notifications on this document.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [a11cb62](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/a11cb62053c93eba377039370cc79933b2ea444a)
* 12.0: [4435170](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/443517005639aaab0c5859d26b161848f7c5cf00)
* 13.0: [1e00521](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/1e00521f7908f0967f307da3120394a482dd2bad)
* 13.0-ent, 12.0-ent and 11.0-ent (Enterprise): see 13.0, 12.0 and 11.0.

## Description

![@odony](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2039870?v=4&size=48)[odony](https://github.com/odony)opened [on Dec 22, 2020](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/issues/63710#issue-773033517)
# Security Advisory - [CVE-2019-11785](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-77f7-r2cc-pcqm "CVE-2019-11785")

**Affects**: Odoo 13.0 and earlier (Community and Enterprise Editions)

**CVE ID**: [CVE-2019-11785](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11785)

**Component**: Discuss

**Credits**: Nils Hamerlinck (Trobz)

Improper access control in mail module (followers) in Odoo Community 13.0

and earlier and Odoo Enterprise 13.0 and earlier, allows remote

authenticated users to obtain access to messages posted on business records

there were not given access to, and subscribe to receive future messages.

## I. Background

The Discuss application provides generic productivity components to other Odoo

Apps, including a system allowing users to create private or public discussion

channels. This system allows to two users to chat together.

## II. Problem Description

A missing access control allowed unauthorized users to become followers

of arbitrary database records.

## III. Impact

**Attack Vector**: Network exploitable

**Authentication**: User account required

**CVSS3 Score**: Medium :: 6.5

**CVSS3 Vector**: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)

A malicious external user who has been granted Portal access could

send a specially crafted request to become follower of an arbitrary

database records, which would let them read past private discussions

on the document, and receive future notifications on this document.

Odoo S.A. is not aware of any use of this vulnerability in the wild.

## IV. Workaround

There is no known workaround, applying the patches is strongly recommended.

Odoo Cloud servers have been patched as soon as the correction was available.

## V. Solution

Apply the patches corresponding to your Odoo installation, or upgrade

to the latest revision, either via GitHub or by downloading the

latest version from <https://www.odoo.com/page/download>

or <http://nightly.odoo.com>

To apply the patch, change into the main directory of your Odoo

installation (the one containing "openerp" and "addons" directories),

then execute the patch command, typically:

```
   patch -p0 -f < /path/to/the_patch_file.patch

```

This command assumes your installation layout corresponds to

the latest source code layout of the Odoo project on GitHub.

If your installation differs, please extract the various patch

hunks from the files and apply them in the appropriate locations.

## VI. Correction details

The following list contains the revisions after which the vulnerability

is corrected:

* 11.0: [a11cb62](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/a11cb62053c93eba377039370cc79933b2ea444a)
* 12.0: [4435170](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/443517005639aaab0c5859d26b161848f7c5cf00)
* 13.0: [1e00521](https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/1e00521f7908f0967f307da3120394a482dd2bad)
* 13.0-ent, 12.0-ent and 11.0-ent (Enterprise): see 13.0, 12.0 and 11.0.
