# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

Subject: Kubernetes: Multiple secret leaks when verbose logging is enabled

Hello,

Multiple security issues have been discovered in Kubernetes that allow
for the exposure of secret data in logs, when verbose logging options
are enabled. These issues have been rated Medium, with a CVSS of 4.7
CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N. CVE-2020-8563 has been
rated slightly higher as the leaked credential allows for a scope change
to the underlying cloud provider.

  * CVE-2020-8563: Secret leaks in logs for vSphere Provider
    kube-controller-manager
  * CVE-2020-8564: Docker config secrets leaked when file is malformed
    and loglevel >= 4
  * CVE-2020-8565: Incomplete fix for CVE-2019-11250 allows for token
    leak in logs when logLevel >= 9
  * CVE-2020-8566: Ceph RBD adminSecrets exposed in logs when loglevel >= 4

## Am I vulnerable?

  * CVE-2020-8563 - Vulnerable if using VSphere provider and
    kube-controller-manager is using logLevel >= 4
  * CVE-2020-8564 - Vulnerable if pull secrets are stored in a docker
    config file and loglevel >= 4. Also requires the docker config file
    to be malformed.
  * CVE-2020-8565 - Vulnerable if kube-apiserver is using logLevel >= 9
  * CVE-2020-8566 - Vulnerable if Ceph RBD volumes are supported and
    kube-controller-manager is using logLevel >= 4

### Affected Versions

CVE-2020-8563 only affects 1.19.0 -1.19.2. All other CVEs affect 1.19,
1.18 and 1.17 releases and earlier.

### Fixed Versions

  *      CVE-2020-8563 - v1.19.3
  *      CVE-2020-8564 - v1.19.3, v1.18.10, v1.17.13
  *      CVE-2020-8565 - v1.20.0-alpha2
  *      CVE-2020-8566 - v1.19.3, v1.18.10, v1.17.13

### Fixes

  *      CVE-2020-8563 - <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95236>
  *      CVE-2020-8564 -
    <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/94712>
  *      CVE-2020-8565 -
    <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95316>
  *      CVE-2020-8566 -
    <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/95245>

## Impact

If sufficient verbose logging is enabled, the following secrets can be
exposed in logs:

  *      CVE-2020-8563 - VSphere Cloud credentials
  *      CVE-2020-8564 - Pull secrets or other credentials in docker
    config file
  *      CVE-2020-8565 - Kubernetes authorization tokens (incl. bearer
    tokens and basic auth)
  *      CVE-2020-8566 - Ceph RBD Admin secrets

## How do I mitigate these vulnerabilities?

All four vulnerabilities are only exposed when verbose logging levels
are enabled for the respective component, which is not done by default.
These vulnerabilities can all therefore be mitigated by ensuring that
the log level is below 4.

All four vulnerabilities can additionally be mitigated by preventing
untrusted access to log files. An attacker can only recover the
sensitive information exposed by these vulnerabilities if they can
access the target logs.

If any exposed secrets are found in log files, it is recommended to
rotate them as soon as possible. Exposure can occur in Kubernetes server
side components, including kube-apiserver and kube-contoller-manager.
Client tools using the affected code, like kubectl, can also log secret
data.
Detection

Logs can be searched for any secret values that have already been
exposed. The individual pull requests for each vulnerability contain
details on the particular log entries that can include secret values.

For example, one can examine the kube-controller-manager logs for
entries exposing Ceph RBD admin secrets:

$ kubectl logs -n kube-system kube-controller-manager | grep rbd | grep key

## Additional Details

Please refer to the individual pull issues for further details:

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1740434#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-13 01:46:21 UTC  ``` Kubernetes requires an authentication mechanism to enforce users’ privileges. One method of authentication, bearer tokens, are opaque strings used to associate a user with their having successfully authenticated previously. Any user with possession of this token may masquerade as the original user (the “bearer”) without further authentication.  Within Kubernetes, the bearer token is captured within the hyperkube kube-apiserver system logs at high verbosity levels (--v 10). A malicious user with access to the system logs on such a system could masquerade as any user who has previously logged into the system.   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1740434#c1)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-13 01:46:36 UTC  ``` Created kubernetes tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1740435](show_bug.cgi?id=1740435 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-11250 kubernetes: Bearer tokens written to logs at high verbosity levels (>= 7) [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1740434#c2)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-13 01:47:12 UTC  ``` Upstream Issue:  <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81114>   ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1740434#c3)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-15 04:37:33 UTC  ``` Upstream Patch:  <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/81330/commits/010d8382>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1740434#c5)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-12-16 13:51:48 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 3.11  Via RHSA-2019:4052 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:4052](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A4052)   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1740434#c6)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-12-16 14:09:27 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

## Description

![@cji](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/419708?u=887fb8010990ba7093e7f107e25f6c5f5a5d4db1&v=4&size=48)[cji](https://github.com/cji)opened [on Aug 8, 2019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81114#issue-478213865)

This issue was reported in the [Kubernetes Security Audit Report](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-security-audit/findings/Kubernetes%20Final%20Report.pdf)

**Description**

Kubernetes requires an authentication mechanism to enforce users’ privileges. One method of authentication, bearer tokens, are opaque strings used to associate a user with their having successfully authenticated previously. Any user with possession of this token may masquerade as the original user (the “bearer”) without further authentication.

Within Kubernetes, the bearer token is captured within the hyperkube kube-apiserver system logs at high verbosity levels (--v 10). A malicious user with access to the system logs on such a system could masquerade as any user who has previously logged into the system.

**Exploit Scenario**

Alice logs into a Kubernetes cluster and is issued a Bearer token. The system logs her token. Eve, who has access to the logs but not the production Kubernetes cluster, replays Alice’s Bearer token, and can masquerade as Alice to the cluster.

**Recommendation**

Short term, remove the Bearer token from the log. Do not log any authentication credentials within the system, including tokens, private keys, or passwords that may be used to authenticate to the production Kubernetes cluster, regardless of the logging level.

Long term, either implement policies that enforce code review to ensure that sensitive data is not exposed in logs, or implement logging filters that check for sensitive data and remove it prior to outputting the log. In either case, ensure that sensitive data cannot be trivially stored in logs.

**Anything else we need to know?**:

See [#81146](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/81146) for current status of all issues created from these findings.

The vendor gave this issue an ID of TOB-K8S-001 and it was finding 6 of the report.

The vendor considers this issue Medium Severity.

To view the original finding, begin on page 31 of the [Kubernetes Security Review Report](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/wg-security-audit/findings/Kubernetes%20Final%20Report.pdf)

**Environment**:

* Kubernetes version: 1.13.4
