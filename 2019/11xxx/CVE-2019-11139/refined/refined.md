Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11139:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The provided content is directly related to CVE-2019-11139. Multiple sources mention the CVE ID and describe the vulnerability.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is an "Improper conditions check in the voltage modulation interface". Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how certain Intel Xeon Scalable Processors handle voltage modulation requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the lack of a proper check within the voltage modulation interface. This allows for potentially out-of-bounds or unexpected requests that can lead to a denial of service.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition on the affected system. The system may become unstable or unresponsive.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local access. An attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have privileged user access on the target machine to trigger the improper voltage modulation. User interaction is required from the local user with high privilege, or the local user must be able to make the system do it with his access.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The Intel advisory INTEL-SA-00271 specifically calls out the problem as an improper conditions check in the voltage modulation interface for some Intel Xeon Scalable Processors which allows a privileged local user to cause denial of service.
*   The Debian security advisory DSA-4565-2 mentions CVE-2019-11139, and that the update contains updated CPU microcode for several Intel CPU models to address the vulnerability.
*   openSUSE Security Updates (openSUSE-SU-2019:2527-1 and openSUSE-SU-2019:2528-1)  note the CVE-2019-11139 fix as a microcode fix for voltage modulation issues.
*   The SUSE bugzilla entry for bug 1141035 indicates that the fix is delivered via Intel microcode updates and not in the SUSE OS itself.
*   SUSE CVE page for CVE-2019-11139 states that the vulnerability is related to the voltage modulation interface.

**4. Affected Products**

The affected products include various Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors:

*   Intel® Xeon® Platinum Processors (8153, 8156, 8158, 8160, 8160F, 8160M, 8160T, 8164, 8168, 8170, 8170M, 8176, 8176F, 8176M, 8180, 8180M)
*   Intel® Xeon® Gold Processors (5115, 5118, 5119T, 5120, 5120T, 5122, 6126, 6126F, 6126T, 6128, 6130, 6130F, 6130T, 6132, 6134, 6134M, 6136, 6138, 6138F, 6138T, 6140, 6140M, 6142, 6142F, 6142M, 6144, 6146, 6148, 6148F, 6150, 6152, 6154)
*   Intel® Xeon® Silver Processors (4108, 4109T, 4110, 4112, 4114, 4114T, 4116, 4116T)
*   Intel® Xeon® Bronze Processors (3104, 3106)

**5. Recommendations:**

*   The primary recommendation is to update the firmware/microcode of the affected processors with the latest version provided by the system manufacturer.
*   If the system configuration is untrusted, it is recommended to apply the firmware update through the BIOS.

**6. Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability comes in the form of CPU microcode updates.
*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a privileged local user.
*   The vulnerability affects how some Intel Xeon processors modulate voltage.

In summary, CVE-2019-11139 is a vulnerability in Intel Xeon Scalable Processors' voltage modulation interface that can be exploited by a privileged local user, leading to a denial of service. The solution is to apply firmware updates that include updated CPU microcode to mitigate this improper conditions check.
