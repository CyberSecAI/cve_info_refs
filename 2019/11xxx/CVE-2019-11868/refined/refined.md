Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-11868

**Root Cause:** A vulnerability exists in the NDIS 5.x based Local Bridge module of SoftEther VPN.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker, already logged into a Windows system running a vulnerable SoftEther VPN server, can exploit a flaw in the NDIS 5.x Local Bridge module to elevate their privileges.
*   **BSOD (Blue Screen of Death):** Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a system crash (BSOD).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged local user can gain higher privileges on the system.
*   **System Instability:** The system can crash, leading to downtime.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have a valid logon session on the Windows machine running the vulnerable SoftEther VPN server.
*   **Malicious Program Execution:** The attacker needs to execute a specially crafted program to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account and be logged into the same Windows machine that is running the SoftEther VPN Server.
*   **Ability to execute programs:** The attacker must have the ability to execute programs on the target machine.

**Affected Software:**
*   SoftEther VPN Server 4.29 Build 9680 or older for Windows
*   SoftEther VPN Bridge 4.29 Build 9680 or older for Windows
*   VPN Gate Relay Service 4.29 Build 9680 or older for Windows

This vulnerability affects systems running Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8.0 (but not 8.1) when the Local Bridge or SecureNAT function is enabled on those OSes.  The vulnerability does not impact Windows 8.1, Windows 10, or later server versions.  Linux, FreeBSD, macOS and Solaris are also unaffected.

The advisory also notes specific scenarios that increase vulnerability:
* Sharing a Windows computer between the VPN server and unprivileged user terminals
* Allowing attackers to execute untrusted programs on the server computer
