- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control in the Access Professional Edition (APE) software, specifically related to how the Windows SMB protocol is handled on client installations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated access to sensitive data via the SMB protocol, where client installations of APE prior to version 3.8 do not require authorization by the APE administrator.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data within the APE system, potentially allowing them unauthorized site access.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack, by exploiting the SMB protocol on the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the APE server. They can achieve this without prior authentication.
