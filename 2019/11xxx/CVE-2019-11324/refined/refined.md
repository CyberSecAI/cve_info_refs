{
  "CVE-2019-11324": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "When verifying HTTPS connections with an SSLContext, system CA certificates were loaded into the SSLContext by default, in addition to manually specified CA certificates. This caused TLS handshakes that should have failed based on only the manually specified certs to succeed based on the system CA certs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Certificate mishandling",
      "Mishandling of certificate verification"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "TLS handshakes can succeed unexpectedly when the desired CA certs should have caused them to fail.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by passing an SSLContext to urllib3."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": [
      "Attacker controls the desired set of CA certificates"
     ]
  }
