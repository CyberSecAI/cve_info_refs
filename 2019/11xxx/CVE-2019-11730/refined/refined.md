  "CVE-2019-11730": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use `file:` URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the browser's same-origin policy implementation regarding local files, where it incorrectly allows a local HTML file to access other files within the same directory or subdirectories using file: URIs. This occurs because the browser treats all files in a directory as having the same origin.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect same-origin policy implementation",
      "Lack of proper restrictions on local file access"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can potentially steal locally stored files by sending a malicious HTML file and tricking the victim into opening it. The HTML file can then use JavaScript to access other files in the same directory using `file:` URIs and exfiltrate the content to a server controlled by the attacker.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "By sending a malicious HTML file as an attachment through a messaging application.",
      "By hosting a malicious HTML file on a web server and tricking the user to access the file through a browser."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to send or host a malicious HTML file and be able to trick the victim into opening it via a vulnerable browser."
