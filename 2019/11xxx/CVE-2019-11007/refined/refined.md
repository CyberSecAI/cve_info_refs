Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-11007:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability is caused by a heap-based buffer over-read in the `ReadMNGImage` function, located within the `coders/png.c` file of GraphicsMagick. This occurs when the function attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer while processing an image colormap.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

-   **Heap-based Buffer Over-read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in heap memory, where the `ReadMNGImage` function reads beyond the allocated buffer for a colormap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The over-read can lead to application crashes, effectively denying service.
-   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability could potentially expose sensitive information stored in adjacent memory locations, depending on the memory layout.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted Image File:** The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted image file that triggers the vulnerable code path during processing.
-   **Network:** As stated in the CVSS metrics, the vulnerability can be triggered over the network

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Ability to Submit Malicious Image:** Attackers need the ability to submit a specially crafted image to a system processing it using GraphicsMagick library. This could be through web uploads, file processing pipelines, or any other means where GraphicsMagick is used for image handling.
-   **User Interaction:** The vulnerable code path is only triggered when the crafted image file is processed by a user, which means that this vulnerability requires user interaction to be exploited.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects GraphicsMagick version 1.4 snapshot-20190322 Q8.
*   SUSE classifies this issue as "important" severity.
*   The vulnerability is rated as a medium risk by NIST.
*   The CVSS v3 score from NIST gives this an 8.1.
