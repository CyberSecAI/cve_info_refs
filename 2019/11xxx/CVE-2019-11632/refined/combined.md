# Prerequisites

* We are ready to publicly disclose this vulnerability or exploit according to our [responsible disclosure process](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/2430143/Security%2BDisclosure%2BPolicy).
* I have raised a CVE according to our [CVE process] ([https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/8290305/Requesting+a+CVE+ID](https://octopushq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IN/pages/8290305/Requesting%2Ba%2BCVE%2BID))
* I have written a descriptive issue title
* I have tagged the issue appropriately (area/security, kind/bug, tag/regression?)

## Description

The `VariableViewUnscoped` and `VariableEditUnscoped` permissions can be scoped to projects. As part of the permissions redesign we did during the spaces project, this behavior was lost, which means these permissions can no longer be scoped to projects. Granting a user these permissions gives them access to unscoped variables in *all* projects, regardless of how this permission has been scoped.

### Repro steps

1. Create a project (eg OctoFX) with some variables that are unscoped, and some variables that are scoped to an environment (eg Development)

   [![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783712-71e40a80-6830-11e9-9d52-ccc58dfdf94c.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783712-71e40a80-6830-11e9-9d52-ccc58dfdf94c.png)
2. Create another unrelated project (eg Foo)
3. Configure a separate user that has the following permissions

* The "Project Contributor" role scoped to [OctoFX, Development]
* `VariableViewUnscoped` scoped to [Foo]

4. As that user, try to view the variables for the project OctoFX

### Expected result

This user should not be able to view the Unscoped variable within OctoFX, because their `VariableViewUnscoped` permissions was not scoped to the OctoFX project.

### Actual result

This user is able to see the unscoped variables from the project OctoFX, regardless of how their `VariableViewUnscoped` permission has been scoped.

## Screenshots

### In 2018.10.6 (working)

With this permissions setup

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783884-372ea200-6831-11e9-886d-35a93881aa99.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783884-372ea200-6831-11e9-886d-35a93881aa99.png)

You can only view the one variable in OctoFX

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783842-123a2f00-6831-11e9-9709-f87599a716e5.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783842-123a2f00-6831-11e9-9709-f87599a716e5.png)

### In 2019.4.4 (failing)

With this permissions setup

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783965-9f7d8380-6831-11e9-80dd-d106e22a015b.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783965-9f7d8380-6831-11e9-80dd-d106e22a015b.png)

You can view all unscoped variables in OctoFX

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783958-942a5800-6831-11e9-90e9-30db250b8a26.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1892715/56783958-942a5800-6831-11e9-90e9-30db250b8a26.png)

## Details

These affected permissions are not used by an built in roles in Octopus. If you are using built in roles only, then you will not be affected.

## Affected versions of Octopus Server

`2019.1.0` - `2019.3.1` (inclusive), and `2019.4.0` - `2019.4.5` (inclusive)

## Workarounds

There is no known way of preserving the same access control that existed before this regression was introduced.

Until an upgrade can be performed to a version of Octopus Server where this bug has been fixed, It is recommended that the `VariableViewUnscoped` and `VariableEditUnscoped` permissions are revoked where possible and only highly privileged users (eg. admins or space managers) are granted these permissions.
