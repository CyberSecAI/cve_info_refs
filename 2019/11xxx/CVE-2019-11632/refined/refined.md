Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11632:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a regression introduced during a "spaces project" redesign in Octopus Deploy. The `VariableViewUnscoped` and `VariableEditUnscoped` permissions, which were previously capable of being scoped to specific projects, lost this functionality.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** The core issue is that the permissions `VariableViewUnscoped` and `VariableEditUnscoped` no longer respect project scoping. When these permissions are granted to a user, they unintentionally gain access to unscoped variables across all projects, regardless of the intended scope.
*   **Regression Bug:** The loss of project scoping was introduced as a regression, indicating a failure to maintain previous security controls during code refactoring.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Exposure:** An attacker with the `VariableViewUnscoped` permission, even if scoped to a single project, can view sensitive unscoped variables in other projects that they should not have access to.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** Similarly, an attacker with `VariableEditUnscoped` can modify these unscoped variables, leading to potential disruption or compromise of those other projects.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with limited project access can potentially gain broader access to sensitive data through this vulnerability, effectively escalating their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the application's user permission management system.
*   An attacker needs a user account with  `VariableViewUnscoped` or `VariableEditUnscoped` permissions granted, even if those are intended for a specific project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to an Octopus Deploy instance:** The attacker needs access to an affected Octopus Deploy installation
*   **User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account in Octopus Deploy.
*   **Specific Permissions:** The user account must have `VariableViewUnscoped` or `VariableEditUnscoped` permissions, even if these are incorrectly scoped to a different project than the one being targeted for unauthorized access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content contains references to a specific github issue describing this vulnerability.
*   The issue mentions that built-in roles in Octopus Deploy do not use affected permissions directly; custom permissions are needed to be exploited
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Octopus Server versions 2019.3.2, and 2019.4.7
*   A workaround is suggested, which is to revoke these permissions wherever possible until an upgrade can be performed.
