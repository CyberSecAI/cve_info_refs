## Package

gomod

github.com/facebook/fbthrift
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.31.1-0.20200311080807-483ed864d69f

## Patched versions

0.31.1-0.20200311080807-483ed864d69f

## Description

Golang Facebook Thrift servers would not error upon receiving messages declaring containers of sizes larger than the payload. As a result, malicious clients could send short messages which would result in a large memory allocation, potentially leading to denial of service. This issue affects Facebook Thrift prior to v2020.03.16.00.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Summary:
For performance reasons we preallocate golang containers with
the size given in the field header.  This allowed an attacker to
trigger very large memory allocations and potentially crash the server
with small messages.  Before creating the golang container confirm
that the message is theoretically large enough to contain a list/map/set
of the given size.

This requires that the binary and compact protocols use transports
that can expose the amount of data waiting to be read.  As a result of
this change you will not be able to do things like use the raw socket
transport or talk to endpoints over the HTTP transport that don't send
a content length header.

Fixes [CVE-2019-11939](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w3r9-r9w7-8h48 "CVE-2019-11939").
