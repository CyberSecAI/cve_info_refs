Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11939:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of container sizes (maps, lists, sets) declared in messages processed by Golang Facebook Thrift servers. Specifically, the servers would preallocate memory for containers based on the size indicated in the message header, without verifying if the actual message payload was large enough to justify the declared container size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the failure to validate the declared container size against the remaining data in the message payload.
*   **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:**  The vulnerability leads to uncontrolled memory allocation based on the attacker-controlled size parameter in the message, potentially leading to excessive memory usage.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious client can send short messages that declare very large container sizes, forcing the server to allocate large amounts of memory. This can lead to memory exhaustion and ultimately cause a denial of service by crashing the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The attack can be launched remotely over the network by sending crafted Thrift messages to a vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server.
*   **Thrift Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft valid Thrift messages with malicious container size declarations.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Code:** The vulnerability is present in the `binary_protocol.go` and `compact_protocol.go` files within the `thrift/lib/go/thrift` directory of the facebook/fbthrift repository.
*   **Specific Packages Affected:** `github.com/facebook/fbthrift/thrift/lib/go/thrift`.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves adding checks to ensure that the declared container size is compatible with the remaining bytes in the message, preventing over-allocation.
*  **Transport limitation:** The fix requires transports that can expose the amount of data waiting to be read. As a result, raw socket transport and endpoints over HTTP transport that don't send a content length header won't work.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 (High), with an attack vector of "Network," low attack complexity, no privileges required, and a high impact on availability.
