{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and permission checks in the file management functionalities of the doorGets CMS. Specifically, the `renamefile.php` script allows unauthorized users to rename files across directories due to insufficient filtering of the `$path` variable. This can be exploited to move configuration files out of the web root and make the server unserviceable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Missing Authentication",
       "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to rename files, potentially moving critical configuration files to arbitrary locations, resulting in a denial of service. The attacker can also achieve sensitive information disclosure by moving the files to accessible locations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP POST request to `/fileman/php/renamefile.php` with crafted `f` and `n` parameters"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, but does not need to be authenticated. The attacker needs to know the path of the target file and the desired destination."
