Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11627:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `gpg-key2ps` tool within the `signing-party` package. This tool generates PostScript files containing OpenPGP key fingerprint slips.
- An unsafe shell call is made within `gpg-key2ps` when processing user IDs, allowing for shell injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Shell Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary shell commands through user IDs. The `gpg-key2ps` tool does not properly sanitize or escape special characters in user IDs before passing them to the shell.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the system where `gpg-key2ps` is run. The attacker can gain the privileges of the user running the command.
- **System Compromise:** This can lead to a complete system compromise including data theft, modification or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously Crafted User IDs:** An attacker crafts a user ID for an OpenPGP key that contains shell metacharacters and commands. 
- **Use of `gpg-key2ps`**: When `gpg-key2ps` is run with that key as an input, the injected code will execute.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Create/Control OpenPGP Keys:** The attacker must be able to create or modify OpenPGP keys and associate a malicious user ID to a key.
- **Invocation of `gpg-key2ps`:** The attacker must be able to cause `gpg-key2ps` to be run using the malicious key. This could be done by tricking a user, or through other exploits.
- **Local or Network Access:** While the vulnerability is present in the `gpg-key2ps` binary, the execution could be triggered locally, or potentially remotely, depending on the use of the program and how it's exposed.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was present in `signing-party` versions 1.1.x and 2.x before 2.10-1.
- The fix involved replacing the unsafe shell call with a secure method for encoding user IDs, using Perl's `Encode.pm` module instead of shelling out to `iconv`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "critical" by SUSE, and "important" by Debian.
- The issue has been addressed in various distributions including Debian, Ubuntu, openSUSE, and SUSE.
