The provided content reveals the following information regarding CVE-2019-11454:

*   **Vulnerability:** Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Location:** `http/cervlet.c` in Tildeslash Monit before 5.25.3.
*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulation of an unsanitized user field in the Authorization header for HTTP Basic Authentication. This is mishandled during a `_viewlog` operation.
*   **Attacker Capability:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can introduce arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of arbitrary JavaScript.

## Summary of Vulnerability Information:

The vulnerability is a persistent XSS flaw in the `http/cervlet.c` file of Monit versions prior to 5.25.3. A remote, unauthenticated attacker can exploit this by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code through a specially crafted Authorization header during HTTP Basic Authentication. The injected code is then mishandled when a user views the logs (`_viewlog` operation), leading to the execution of the attacker's JavaScript in the user's browser.

The github.com content contains the exploit code (`monit_xss.py`).
