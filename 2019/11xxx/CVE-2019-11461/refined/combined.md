| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1133041#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-04-23 06:45:11 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-11461  An issue was discovered in GNOME Nautilus 3.30 prior to 3.30.6 and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1133043#c0)  Marcus Meissner   2019-04-23 06:49:24 UTC  ``` CVE-2019-11460  An issue was discovered in GNOME gnome-desktop 3.26, 3.28, and 3.30 prior to 3.30.2.2, and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.

# CVE-2019-11460

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11459.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11461.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11460 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11460)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in GNOME gnome-desktop 3.26, 3.28, and 3.30 prior to 3.30.2.2, and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.

# (CVE-2019-11461) Incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5226

Nautilus is vulnerable to <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10063> because it has bundled a vulnerable version of gnome-desktop-thumbnail-script.c, see [gnome-desktop#112 (closed)](/GNOME/gnome-desktop/-/issues/112 "(CVE-2019-11460) Incomplete fix for CVE-2017-5226") for details.

Note it's probably a really bad idea to bundle security-critical code like this; it's just luck that I noticed nautilus had copied it when doing a Debian codesearch, I doubt you'd have noticed otherwise....

# CVE-2019-11461

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11460.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11463.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11461 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11461)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in GNOME Nautilus 3.30 prior to 3.30.6 and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.
