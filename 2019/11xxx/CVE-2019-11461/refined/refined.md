  "cveId": "CVE-2019-11461",
  "description": "An issue was discovered in GNOME Nautilus 3.30 prior to 3.30.6 and 3.32 prior to 3.32.1. A compromised thumbnailer may escape the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers by using the TIOCSTI ioctl to push characters into the input buffer of the thumbnailer's controlling terminal, allowing an attacker to escape the sandbox if the thumbnailer has a controlling terminal. This is due to improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems, similar to CVE-2019-10063.",
  "vulnerabilityDetails": {
    "rootCause": "Improper filtering of the TIOCSTI ioctl on 64-bit systems within the bubblewrap sandbox used to confine thumbnailers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Sandbox escape"
    ],
    "impact": "A compromised thumbnailer can escape the bubblewrap sandbox, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host system.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Local attack",
      "Compromised thumbnailer"
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "A compromised thumbnailer application is required to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to control or compromise a thumbnailer that has a controlling terminal."
