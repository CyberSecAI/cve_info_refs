**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid account on the Bonobo Git Server instance.
- **Web Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to access the user profile edit form through the web interface.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in Bonobo Git Server version 6.3.0 and potentially earlier versions.
- The fix for this vulnerability was released in version 6.5.0.
- After submitting the malicious form, the user needs to log out and log back in for the role changes to take effect.
