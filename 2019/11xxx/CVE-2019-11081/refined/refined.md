- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Sirona Sidexis 4 software has stored default credentials for the user "sidexis4service".
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored default credentials. The "sidexis4service" user's password is not unique or changed during deployment and it's used to run critical system services and tasks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Full compromise of the system. The attacker could gain full access by exploiting the default credentials to access services running under the "sidexis4service" account, which could lead to data theft, manipulation, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based. An attacker can potentially leverage these default credentials to gain unauthorized access to systems running the vulnerable software if exposed or accessible.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the system running the Sirona Sidexis 4 software or find a way to exploit the service remotely.
