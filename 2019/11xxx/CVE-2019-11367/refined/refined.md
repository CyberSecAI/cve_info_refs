Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11367:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The AUO Solar Data Recorder uses HTTP Basic Access Authentication.
*   The vulnerability lies in the web application's response when accessing files under the `/protect/` path. Instead of properly handling authentication, the server includes the plaintext username and password within the `WWW-Authenticate` header.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Credentials:** Exposing authentication credentials in the `WWW-Authenticate` header in plaintext is a significant security flaw.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** The web application fails to protect the credentials and the `/protect/` path, leading to unauthorized access.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can obtain the plaintext username and password by simply accessing the `/protect/` path.
*   **Full System Compromise:** With the stolen credentials, an attacker can log in to the AUO Solar Data Recorder and gain full access to the system.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request to `/protect/`:** The primary attack vector is sending an HTTP request to any file located under the `/protect/` path on the vulnerable device.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the AUO Solar Data Recorder.
*   **No prior authentication:** The vulnerability is triggered before any authentication is done. An attacker doesn't need any credentials to trigger the vulnerability

**Additional Information**

*   The vulnerability affects all versions of AUO Solar Data Recorder prior to version 1.3.0.
*   The vendor's homepage is `https://www.auo.com/zh-TW`.
*   The device is a proprietary device found at `https://solar.auo.com/en-global/Support_Download_Center/index`.

In summary, CVE-2019-11367 describes a severe vulnerability where the AUO Solar Data Recorder leaks its credentials in the HTTP response headers when accessing a specific path. An attacker can readily obtain the credentials and gain complete access to the device.
