  "cve_id": "CVE-2019-11455",
  "description": "The provided content details a buffer over-read vulnerability in the `Util_urlDecode` function of Monit before version 5.25.3. This vulnerability allows a remote authenticated attacker to retrieve contents of adjacent memory and cause a denial of service.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause is a buffer over-read in the `Util_urlDecode` function within the `util.c` file. The function improperly handles URL decoding, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer over-read: The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking during URL decoding."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit allows an attacker to read potentially sensitive data from adjacent memory locations and trigger a denial of service (application outage).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Remote authenticated attack: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted GET or POST parameters to the Monit web interface."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Authentication: The attacker must be authenticated to the Monit web interface to exploit this vulnerability."
    ],
     "additional_notes": "The provided exploit code uses format string specifiers in the payload. A related denial of service is also described which appears to be caused by a different vector, and has a separate exploit. The vulnerability was fixed in Monit 5.25.3."
