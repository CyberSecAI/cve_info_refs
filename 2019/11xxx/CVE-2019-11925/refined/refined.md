Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11925:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient boundary checks within the GD extension of HHVM when processing the JPEG APP12 block marker. Specifically, a length calculation error in the `exif_process_APP12` function leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read:** The vulnerability allows reading memory outside the allocated buffer due to a faulty length calculation when processing the second tag within the APP12 block. The code calculates the length of the second tag incorrectly, potentially leading to reading 2 bytes beyond the buffer's boundary.
*   **Insufficient Boundary Checks**: The code fails to properly validate the size of the input data and the calculated offsets, causing the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leak:**  The out-of-bounds read can potentially leak sensitive information from the server's memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious JPEG Input:**  The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted, invalid JPEG image to the GD library. This crafted image contains a malformed APP12 block designed to trigger the flawed length calculation and out-of-bounds read.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to submit a crafted JPEG image:** The attacker must be able to submit a malicious JPEG image to an application that uses the vulnerable HHVM GD extension for image processing. The attacker does not need any special privileges or user interaction to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `hphp/runtime/ext/gd/ext_gd.cpp` file, specifically within the `exif_process_APP12` function.
*   The problematic code snippet performs the following (simplified):
    *   `l1` is calculated as the length of the first tag.
    *   The code attempts to calculate the length (`l2`) of the second tag with:  `length - 2 - l1 + 1` , where length is the buffer length.
    *   The correct calculation should be `length - (2 + l1 + 1)` which is  `length - 2 - l1 - 1`. The faulty calculation results in reading 2 bytes too far.
*   The fix modifies the length calculation to `length - 2 - l1 - 1`, ensuring the read stays within buffer bounds.

**Affected Versions:**

*   HHVM versions prior to 3.30.9
*   All versions between 4.0.0 and 4.8.3
*   All versions between 4.9.0 and 4.15.2
*   Versions 4.16.0 to 4.16.3, 4.17.0 to 4.17.2, 4.18.0 to 4.18.1, 4.19.0, and 4.20.0 to 4.20.1.
