The vulnerability is present in a third-party embedded component within Micro Focus Service Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The vulnerability allows for sensitive data exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), implying a remote attack. User interaction is required, since the UI is involved (UI:R). The attack complexity is high (AC:H), which suggests that it might not be straightforward to exploit. The attacker requires low privileges (PR:L) to perform this attack.
