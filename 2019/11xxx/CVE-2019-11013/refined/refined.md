**Related to CVE-2019-11013**
**Vulnerability:** Directory Traversal (Path Traversal)
**Affected Product:** Nimble Streamer versions 3.0.2-2 to 3.5.4-9
**Root Cause:** The server intentionally allowed using a URL that references an object to access content (e.g., video files). By manipulating the URL to reference other files on the server, an attacker could access unintended files.
**Attack Vector:** Modifying the URL by inserting "../" sequences followed by the path to the desired file (e.g., "/etc/passwd") and a null byte ("%00") to terminate the string.
**Impact:** Allows unauthorized access to files on the server.
**Attacker Capabilities:** Ability to modify the URL used to access content on the server.
**Mitigation:**
    *   Input validation (whitelist and reject invalid input; do not accept file and path separators).
    *   Use cryptographically secure random strings to map resources on the server instead of direct URLs.
    *   Limit the privileges of the account that operates the server.
