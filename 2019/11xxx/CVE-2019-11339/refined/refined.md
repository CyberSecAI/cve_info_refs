  "cveId": "CVE-2019-11339",
  "related": true,
  "info": {
    "rootCause": "The vulnerability is caused by a missing check in the studio profile decoder within libavcodec/mpeg4videodec.c when handling crafted MPEG-4 video data.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-array access"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can cause a denial of service (out-of-array access), potentially leading to other unspecified impacts.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Network",
      "MPEG-4 video data"
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to provide crafted MPEG-4 video data.",
    "additionalDetails": "The issue occurs due to how the decoder handles the `interlaced_dct` flag within the studio profile. The fix involves adding an explicit check that clears the `interlaced_dct` flag."
