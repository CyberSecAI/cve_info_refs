Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The Sitecore application deserializes data provided in the `CSRFTOKEN` parameter without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By crafting a malicious payload using tools like `ysoserial.net` and injecting it into the `CSRFTOKEN` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker modifies the `CSRFTOKEN` parameter in an HTTP request to `/sitecore/shell/~/xaml/Sitecore.Shell.Applications.Dialogs.Progress.aspx`.
*   **Crafted Payload:** The malicious payload is generated using `ysoserial.net`, then URL-encoded and base64-encoded.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated with access to the Sitecore admin section.
*   **Vulnerable Application Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application endpoint.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter:** The attacker needs to know to target the `CSRFTOKEN` parameter.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Sitecore version 8.0 revision 150802.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor in October 2018 and a fix was released in April 2019.
*   The exploit is triggered when using the "Serialize users" or "Serialize domains" options within the admin UI.
*   The exploit relies on the fact that `Sitecore.Shell.Applications.Dialogs.Progress.aspx` is vulnerable to insecure deserialization.
