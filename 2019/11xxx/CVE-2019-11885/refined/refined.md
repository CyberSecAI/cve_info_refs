The provided content details a vulnerability found in the eyeDisk USB drive. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The primary vulnerability lies in the insecure way the eyeDisk handles password-based authentication. Instead of securely storing and verifying the password on the device, it retrieves the password from the device and sends the password in cleartext over the USB bus when unlocking. This design flaw means the password can be easily intercepted using USB sniffing tools.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cleartext Password Transmission:** The most critical weakness is sending the password in cleartext over the USB bus during the unlock process.
*   **Insecure Password Storage/Retrieval:** The software retrieves the stored password from the device and uses it for unlocking instead of verifying a hash of the user-entered password on the device.
*   **Lack of Proper Authentication:** The device's security relies on the host software to validate the user-entered password, which is then not used for unlocking the device
*   **Vulnerable SCSI Command Extensions:** The device uses proprietary SCSI extensions with no documentation, potentially creating more security vulnerabilities.
*   **Weak firmware protection:** The device uses a Phison controller which allows for dumping of parts of the flash memory

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can easily intercept the password in cleartext, granting them access to the data stored on the eyeDisk.
*   **Complete Loss of Confidentiality:** Since the password is sent in cleartext, the attacker can unlock the drive as if they were the legitimate user, gaining full access to any stored data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **USB Sniffing:** An attacker can passively sniff the USB communication between the eyeDisk and the host computer using tools like Wireshark with USBPcap support.
*   **Direct SCSI command access:** Using tools like `sg_raw` on Linux, an attacker can send raw SCSI commands to the USB device and dump memory segments where the password is held.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Physical Access to the USB:** An attacker needs physical access to the eyeDisk to plug it into a computer for sniffing the USB traffic or sending SCSI commands.
*   **Basic Understanding of USB/SCSI:** While the primary attack is straightforward (USB sniffing), understanding of USB and SCSI command structures is needed to take full advantage of the controller vulnerabilities.
*   **Tools:**
    *  USB sniffing software such as Wireshark with USBPcap
    *  Command line tools such as `sg_raw`

**Additional Details:**
* The blog post describes how the device uses a Phison PS2251-09-V chip as the main controller and that this controller uses proprietary SCSI commands which can be leveraged to extract more information.
*   The attacker can extract the password using the SCSI command `06 0a 00 00 00 00 00 00 80 56 52 00`, which returns the password in cleartext.
* The vulnerability was disclosed to the vendor and they were unresponsive, leading to public disclosure after a reasonable timeframe.
