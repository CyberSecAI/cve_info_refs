| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1710315#c0)  Dhananjay Arunesh    2019-05-15 10:16:40 UTC  ``` An issue was discovered in Singularity 3.1.0 to 3.2.0-rc2, a malicious user with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within `/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`. The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.

Improve integration with SUSE Products: add support to create Singularity
images with SLE.
\* Newer SUSE versions use a different path for the RPM database.
\* When the installation succeeds by an installation scriptlet fails zypper
returns error code 107. Don't treat this as an error.
\* In order to specify a repository GPG key, add support for multi line
variables.
\* In order to specify a list of additional repos, add support to 'indexed'
variables.
\* Improve handling of SUSE repositires:
- For SLE, use SUSEConnect to get all product repos.
- Allow to specify a repository GPG key.
- Allow to specify additional installation repositories.
- Add group 'singularity', fix ownerships.
Updated to singularity v3.2.0
\* CVE-2019-11328: Instance files are now stored in user's home directory
for privacy and many checks have been added to ensure that a user can't
manipulate files to change `starter-suid` behavior when instances are
joined (many thanks to Matthias Gerstner from the SUSE security team for
finding and securely reporting this vulnerability) (boo#1128598)
\* New features / functionalities
- Introduced a new basic framework for creating and managing plugins
- Added the ability to create containers through multi-stage builds
- Created the concept of a Sylabs Cloud "remote" endpoint and added the
ability for users and admins to set them through CLI and conf files

- Made it possible to compile Singularity outside of `$GOPATH`
- Added a json partition to SIF files for OCI configuration when
building from an OCI source
- Full integration with Singularity desktop for MacOS code base
\* New Commands
- Introduced the `plugin` command group for creating and managing
plugins.
\* Introduced the `remote` command group to support management of
Singularity endpoints.
\* Added to the `key` command group to improve PGP key management.
\* Added the `Stage: <name>` keyword to the definition file header and the
`from <stage name>` option/argument pair to the `%files` section to
support multistage builds
\* Deprecated / removed commands
- The `--token/-t` option has been deprecated in favor of the
`singularity remote` command group
\* Changed defaults / behaviors
- Ask to confirm password on a newly generated PGP key
- Prompt to push a key to the KeyStore when generated
- Refuse to push an unsigned container unless overridden with
`--allow-unauthenticated/-U` option
- Warn and prompt when pulling an unsigned container without the
`--allow-unauthenticated/-U` option For more information check:
<https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/blob/release-3.2/CHANGELOG.md>

Subject: Singularity 3.1.0: CVE-2019-11328: namespace privilege escalation
 and arbitrary file corruption

Hello,

following is a report about a major security issue found in Singularity
[1] major version 3.1.

Introduction
============

Singularity is a Linux namespace based container solution often used in
HPC (high performance computing) environments. In the course of a code
review conducted for inclusion of the new Singularity major version 3 in
SUSE enterprise products I found a major security issue.

The issue affects Singularity versions >= 3.1.0 and it has recently been
fixed in an update to version 3.2.0 [2]. The issue was introduced via
upstream commit b4dcb0e4d77baa1c7647a4a5705ea824bb4e0dca [3].

Issue Details
=============

Singularity 3 uses a setuid root program called `starter-suid` for
setting up Singularity containers. The issue is that containers run as
background instances get bad directory permissions in path
`/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`. The permission of
these directories is set to "<user>:root" with mode 0550.  Since the
unprivileged user is the owner of the directory it may change the mode
to arbitrary values and therefore also the content of the directory to
arbitrary content.

A result of this is that symlinks can be placed in the `ns`
sub-directory that will be followed when joining the container instance
and thus allow unprivileged users to enter arbitrary mnt, pid, net,
cgroup, uts and ipc namespaces. Only user namespaces cannot be joined,
because the `starter-suid` binary refuses to use user namespaces when
running in the setuid context. (`starter-suid` also contains logic that
is only intended for use when the program doesn't carry a setuid root
bit).

Furthermore, because the `starter-suid` program trusts the content of
the JSON config file found in the instance directory, an attacker can
modify this content to change the behaviour of the `starter-suid`
program when joining a container. This way all desired namespaces can be
configured or even the `noNewPrivileges` field can be set to false,
allowing a user to join the container without the `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`
bit set (see `prctl()`).

Even further, during creation of a background instance, the unprivileged
user can try to win a race condition and place a symlink in path
`/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>/<instance>.json`. The
`starter-suid` program will follow this symlink and create and truncate
an existing file in the target location. This allows to create or
overwrite arbitrary files in the system with root privileges. The
content written to the file is only partially attacker controlled,
because the beginning of the JSON has a fixed structure.

I couldn't work out a full local root exploit from these defects yet but
all of the findings are very close to getting root and if putting in
enough energy there's probably some way to achieve it. Being able to
enter arbitary other namespaces is similar in consequences as
CVE-2018-12021 was for Singularity major version 2.

The issue has been fixed by usptream by moving the instance
configuration file into the user's home directory, fixing the
permissions of the directory in /run and not trusting certain parameters
found in the instance's JSON configuration.

PoC
===

For completeness here is a couple of lines that show a PoC for joining
arbitrary ipc, pid and mnt namespaces based on Singularity release
3.1.1:

```
user $ singularity pull library://library/default/debian
[...]
user $ singularity instance start library://library/default/debian deb
# this is the normal way of entering the container, becoming a member of
# the regular container namespaces

```

Timeline
========

2019-04-15: I reported the finding to security@...abs.io
2019-04-18: Sylabs confirmed the issue and discussed various patching
            approaches with me. The process described in [4] has been
            triggered.

An update that solves 5 vulnerabilities and has one errata
is now available.
Description:
This update for singularity fixes the following issues:
- New version 3.6.0. This version introduces a new signature format for
SIF images, and changes to the signing / verification code to address
the following security problems:
- CVE-2020-13845, boo#1174150 In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0,
issues allow the ECL to be bypassed by a malicious user.
- CVE-2020-13846, boo#1174148 In Singularity 3.5 the --all / -a option
to singularity verify returns success even when some objects in a SIF
container are not signed,
or cannot be verified.
- CVE-2020-13847, boo#1174152 In Singularity 3.x versions below 3.6.0,
Singularity's sign and verify commands do not sign metadata found in
the global header or data object descriptors of a SIF file, allowing
an attacker to cause unexpected behavior. A signed container may
verify successfully, even when it has been modified in ways that could
be exploited to cause malicious behavior.
- New features / functionalities
- A new '--legacy-insecure' flag to verify allows verification of SIF
signatures in the old, insecure format.
- A new '-l / --logs' flag for instance list that shows the paths to
instance STDERR / STDOUT log files.
- The --json output of instance list now include paths to STDERR /
STDOUT log files.
- Singularity now supports the execution of minimal Docker/OCI
containers that do not contain /bin/sh, e.g. docker://hello-world.
- A new cache structure is used that is concurrency safe on a filesystem
that supports atomic rename. If you downgrade to Singularity 3.5 or
older after using 3.6 you will need to run singularity cache clean.
- A plugin system rework adds new hook points that will allow the
development of plugins that modify behavior of the runtime. An image
driver concept is introduced for plugins to support new ways of
handling image and
overlay mounts. Plugins built for <=3.5 are not compatible with 3.6.
- The --bind flag can now bind directories from a SIF or ext3 image into
a container.
- The --fusemount feature to mount filesystems to a container via FUSE
drivers is now a supported feature (previously an experimental hidden
flag).
- This permits users to mount e.g. sshfs and cvmfs filesystems to the
container at runtime.
- A new -c/--config flag allows an alternative singularity.conf to be
specified by the root user, or all users in an unprivileged
installation.
- A new --env flag allows container environment variables to be set via
the Singularity command line.
- A new --env-file flag allows container environment variables to be set
from a specified file.
- A new --days flag for cache clean allows removal of items older than a
specified number of days. Replaces the --name flag which is not
generally useful as the cache entries are stored by hash, not a
friendly name.
- Changed defaults / behaviours
- New signature format (see security fixes above).
- Fixed spacing of singularity instance list to be dynamically changing
based off of input lengths instead of fixed number of spaces to account
for long instance names.
- Environment variables prefixed with SINGULARITYENV\_ always take
precedence over variables without SINGULARITYENV\_ prefix.
- The %post build section inherits environment variables from the base
image.
- %files from ... will now follow symlinks for sources that are directly
specified, or directly resolved from a glob pattern. It will not follow
symlinks found through directory traversal. This mirrors Docker
multi-stage COPY behaviour.
- Restored the CWD mount behaviour of v2, implying that CWD path is not
recreated inside container and any symlinks in the CWD path are not
resolved anymore to determine the destination path inside container.
- The %test build section is executed the same manner as singularity test
image.
--fusemount with the container: default directive will foreground the
FUSE process. Use container-daemon: for previous behavior.
- Deprecate -a / --all option to sign/verify as new signature behavior
makes this the default.
- For more information about upstream changes, please check:
<https://github.com/hpcng/singularity/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md>
- Removed --name flag for cache clean; replaced with --days.

# CVE-2019-11328

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11324.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11331.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11328 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11328)

#### Description

An issue was discovered in Singularity 3.1.0 to 3.2.0-rc2, a malicious user with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within `/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`. The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.

%{osg} is defined, to decide whether or not to require python3.
- Get python3 patch from PR #1762 instead of custom defined.
