- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input validation in the Intel(R) AMT subsystem.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper handling of input data within the Intel AMT subsystem, leading to potential security breaches.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to an escalation of privilege, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to potentially gain higher access levels within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any authentication and can perform the attack over the network.
