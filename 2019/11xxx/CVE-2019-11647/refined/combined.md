## 5.0 Known Issues

NetIQ Corporation strives to ensure that our products provide quality solutions for your enterprise software needs. The following issues are currently being researched. If you need further assistance with any issue, please contact [Technical Support](http://www.netiq.com/support).

* [Section 5.1, Progress Indicators Are Not Shown or Do Not Show Correctly](#t489p0w8v3ox)
* [Section 5.2, Not Able to Connect to the LDAP Directory](#t4901a6fgaa6)
* [Section 5.3, Issues with Right-to-Left Text](#t48g3yr1k0g5)

### 5.1 Progress Indicators Are Not Shown or Do Not Show Correctly

*Issue:*
When users save their challenge-response information, the browser does not show the progress indicators correctly. This happens only when using HTTPS and an unsigned certificate. (Bug 1113598)

*Workaround:*
There are two possible workarounds to this issue.

* Use a valid certificate or import a self-signed certificate into the browsers when using HTTPS.
* In the Configuration Edit, change the setting Settings > Security > Web Security > Sticky Session Verification to Enabled - And pre-load browser cache. This second option causes Self Service Password Reset to pre-load the Javascript, CSS files, and images at the beginning of a session.

### 5.2 Not Able to Connect to the LDAP Directory

*Issue:*
Java 9 enables the LDAPS (LDAP over TLS) endpoint identification. If the subject name of the LDAP server certificate does not match the DNS name of the LDAP server, no LDAP connections can be made to the LDAP server. (Bug 1118684)

*Solution:*
Update the subject name of the LDAP server certificate to match the DNS name of the LDAP server. We recommend this option to avoid any security issues.

*Workaround:*
If you are not immediately able to update the name of the LDAP server certificate, see the following technical support document for other workarounds: [7023419](https://support.microfocus.com/kb/doc.php?id=7023419).

### 5.3 Issues with Right-to-Left Text

*Issue:*
With this release, there are issues with the right-to-left text in the Help Desk and People Search modules.

*Solution:*
The right-to-left issues will be addressed in a future patch.
