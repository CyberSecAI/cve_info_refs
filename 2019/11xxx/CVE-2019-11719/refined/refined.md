Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-11719, CVE-2019-11715 and other related CVEs:

**CVE-2019-11719**

*   **Root Cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the Network Security Services (NSS) library when importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8 format if the key has leading 0x00 bytes. The import operation strips those leading bytes, which are necessary, leading to an out-of-bounds read in a subsequent operation that assumes the presence of those bytes.
*   **Weakness:** Improper sanitization of key material during import and insufficient length checks when using curve25519 private keys in the NSS library.
*  **Impact:** Information disclosure. An attacker might be able to extract sensitive data through this out-of-bounds read.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Importing a specially crafted curve25519 private key using PKCS#8 format with leading 0x00 bytes
    *   Using the imported key in a subsequent operation for DH key agreement.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires the ability to provide a crafted private key that is then processed by the vulnerable system. No specific user interaction is needed after providing this key, and no specific attacker position is specified, but it would require the use of applications that utilize the vulnerable code.

**CVE-2019-11715**

*   **Root Cause:** An error during HTML parsing where properly sanitized user input can be misinterpreted, leading to XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Weakness:** Incorrect parsing of sanitized user input in the browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of a web site.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Enticing users to visit a website with specially crafted HTML.
    *   The specific attack vector is not clearly stated but it is due to HTML parsing errors.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a website, and no special privilege is needed to perform this attack other than the knowledge of the underlying weakness, and convincing the target to open a malicious website

**CVE-2019-9811**
*   **Root Cause:** A sandbox escape achieved by installing a malicious language pack and opening a browser feature that uses the compromised translation.
*  **Weakness:** Allows sandbox escape due to the use of untrusted translation files.
*   **Impact:**  High impact. The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass security sandboxing of the browser and potentially execute arbitrary code.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Installation of a specially crafted language pack
    *   Opening a browser feature that uses the compromised translation data
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to craft a malicious language pack and entice the user to install it.

**CVE-2019-11711**

*   **Root Cause**: Improper handling of inner windows, where `document.domain` isn't considered for cross-origin protections when inner windows are reused
*   **Weakness:** Improper cross origin protection during inner window reuse when document.domain is used.
*   **Impact**: Script injection into arbitrary pages by an attacker.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *  Cooperative use of `document.domain` by pages on different subdomains can lead to script injection.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have control over a domain and entice another domain to use document.domain with the attacker's domain, no further user interaction is required beyond that.

**CVE-2019-11712**

*   **Weakness:** Improper validation for cross-origin POST requests within NPAPI plugins, allowing for CSRF attacks.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Allows for sending unintended requests by a victim to a web server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *  Crafting a website that exploits a vulnerable NPAPI plugin using status 308 redirects, no further user interaction is required beyond visiting the page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to have control over a web site and convince a user to visit it.

**CVE-2019-11713**

*  **Root Cause:** Use-after-free vulnerability in the HTTP/2 cached stream.
*   **Weakness:** Improper handling of cached streams in the browser, leads to use after free
*  **Impact:** Potentially exploitable crash, Denial of service

*   **Weakness**: Thread unsafety during UDP connections in the networking library.
*   **Impact:** Potentially exploitable crash
*   **Attack Vectors**: UDP connections
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: No specific attacker position or user interaction needed.

**CVE-2019-11716**

*   **Root Cause:** `window.globalThis` is not enumerable until explicitly accessed, and thus not visible to code using `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window)`.
*   **Weakness:** Missed enumeration for globalThis, which allows for sandbox bypass when freezing windows objects.
*   **Impact:** Sandbox bypass. Allows attacker to bypass sandboxing mechanisms that depend on enumerating and freezing the window object.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *  Crafting a webpage that exploits the missing enumeration to escape sandboxing.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**  Attacker needs to craft malicious webpages that attempt to use the bypass, requires no further user interaction.

**CVE-2019-11717**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper escaping of the caret ("^") character when constructing some URIs.
*  **Weakness:** Improper escaping of the caret character in origins, allowing for possible spoofing.
*  **Impact:** Spoofing origin attributes, which can mislead users about the origin of a resource.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *  Crafted URLs containing the caret character.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to present a URL with a ^ character in the origin section.

**CVE-2019-11720**

*   **Root Cause:**  Some unicode characters are incorrectly treated as whitespace during parsing instead of triggering errors, which allows malicious code to evade XSS filtering.
*   **Weakness:** Incorrect handling of unicode characters during web content parsing.
