#### [#CVE-2019-11711: Script injection within domain through inner window reuse](#CVE-2019-11711)

Reporter
Boris Zbarsky
Impact
high
##### Description

When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of `document.domain` for cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use `document.domain`, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on the other subdomain, even those that did not use `document.domain` to relax their origin security.

#### [#CVE-2019-11712: Cross-origin POST requests can be made with NPAPI plugins by following 308 redirects](#CVE-2019-11712)

Reporter
Gregory Smiley of Security Compass
Impact
high
##### Description

POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

##### Description

Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault due values being improperly sanitized before being copied into memory and used.

##### References

* [Bug 1515342](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515342)

#### [#CVE-2019-11715: HTML parsing error can contribute to content XSS](#CVE-2019-11715)

Reporter
Linus Särud
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Due to an error while parsing page content, it is possible for properly sanitized user input to be misinterpreted and lead to XSS hazards on web sites in certain circumstances.

* [Bug 1555523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1555523)

#### [#CVE-2019-11716: globalThis not enumerable until accessed](#CVE-2019-11716)

Reporter
Chris Hacking
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Until explicitly accessed by script, `window.globalThis` is not enumerable and, as a result, is not visible to code such as `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window)`. Sites that deploy a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to the window object may miss this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed.

#### [#CVE-2019-11718: Activity Stream writes unsanitized content to innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11718)

Reporter
Mark Banner
Impact
moderate
##### Description

#### [#CVE-2019-11719: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key](#CVE-2019-11719)

Reporter
Henry Corrigan-Gibbs
Impact

##### References

* [Bug 1540541](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1540541)

#### [#CVE-2019-11720: Character encoding XSS vulnerability](#CVE-2019-11720)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Some unicode characters are incorrectly treated as whitespace during the parsing of web content instead of triggering parsing errors. This allows malicious code to then be processed, evading cross-site scripting (XSS) filtering.

##### References

* [Bug 1556230](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1556230)

#### [#CVE-2019-11721: Domain spoofing through unicode latin 'kra' character](#CVE-2019-11721)

##### References

* [Bug 1256009](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1256009)

#### [#CVE-2019-11730: Same-origin policy treats all files in a directory as having the same-origin](#CVE-2019-11730)

Reporter
Luigi Gubello
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use `file:` URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. Luigi Gubello demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.

#### [#CVE-2019-11724: Retired site input.mozilla.org has remote troubleshooting permissions](#CVE-2019-11724)

Reporter
Frederik Braun
Impact
low
##### Description

Application permissions give additional remote troubleshooting permission to the site input.mozilla.org, which has been retired and now redirects to another site. This additional permission is unnecessary and is a potential vector for malicious attacks.

Ah, missed this one, thank you auto nag bot.

Didn't we have a similar bug recently around weird characters when creating the principal? I can't seem to find it, but I know Ehsan and Nika were involved in writing this code. Forwarding the needinfo...

Ok, so this one is a bit weird. Marking as a sec bug just to be safe.

For backwards compatibility reasons, when the origin string was first given access to `originAttributes`, it was designed such that the trailing attributes block is optional. Namely, if no attributes are non-default, the origin will be written as it is in the spec. The separator character to distinguish between the core origin and originAttributes is `^`, so an origin might look like `https://twitter.com^userContextId=1`, or like `https://twitter.com` if there were no origin attributes set.

This leads to the spoofing issue. If it was possible for a site to include a `^` in its bare origin string, that could cause issues with the origin logic, as it could be possible to imitate originAttribute from a non-attributed origin. It used to be that the separator used was `!`, but that was found to be spoofable in [bug 1172080](/show_bug.cgi?id=1172080 "RESOLVED FIXED - Using an optional '!' in a principal's origin to denote extra data is spoofable"). That bug is also where the `^` character was chosen.

Normally, a `^` is disallowed inside of a URI, as it will always be escaped as `%5E`. For example:

```
> Services.io.newURI("https://google.com/^", null, null).spec
"https://google.com/%5E"

```

However, we appear to allow this character to appear directly within the host section:

```
> Services.io.newURI("https://google.com^", null, null).spec
"https://google.com^/"

```

This oversight means it's possible to spoof originAttributes currently by forming the URLs correctly.

Fortunately for us, it appears that hostnames aren't allowed to contain the ^ character at all. RFC 952 (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc952>) restricts the characters allowed quite a bit:

```
   1. A "name" (Net, Host, Gateway, or Domain name) is a text string up
   to 24 characters drawn from the alphabet (A-Z), digits (0-9), minus
   sign (-), and period (.).  Note that periods are only allowed when
   they serve to delimit components of "domain style names". (See
   RFC-921, "Domain Name System Implementation Schedule", for
   background).  No blank or space characters are permitted as part of a
   name. No distinction is made between upper and lower case.  The first
   character must be an alpha character.  The last character must not be
   a minus sign or period.  A host which serves as a GATEWAY should have
   "-GATEWAY" or "-GW" as part of its name.  Hosts which do not serve as
   Internet gateways should not use "-GATEWAY" and "-GW" as part of
   their names. A host which is a TAC should have "-TAC" as the last
   part of its host name, if it is a DoD host.  Single character names
   or nicknames are not allowed.

```

This appears to be relaxed a bit in rfc 1123 to allow a number as the first character. (<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1123#page-13>)

```
      The syntax of a legal Internet host name was specified in RFC-952
      [DNS:4].  One aspect of host name syntax is hereby changed: the
      restriction on the first character is relaxed to allow either a
      letter or a digit.  Host software MUST support this more liberal
      syntax.

```

This would suggest that `^` is not a valid character within a hostname. Unfortunately the whatwg URL standard doesn't have that restriction, limiting only the characters NULL, TAB, LF, CR, SPACE, #, %, /, :, ?, @, [, , and ]. (<https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#forbidden-host-code-point>)

For that reason, Firefox's parser allows the character. Interestingly, chromium doesn't allow it, raising an exception:

```
// Firefox
> new URL("https://google.com^")
URL { href: "https://google.com^/", origin: "https://google.com^", ... }

// Chromium
> new URL("https://google.com^")
Uncaught TypeError: Failed to construct 'URL': Invalid URL

```

I think the fix to this issue may be to fix the whatwg URL spec to limit what ASCII characters can appear in hostnames more, and bring our implementation more in line with chrome's.

Disallowing ^ seems doable given that Chrome appears to indeed do that. Safari will likely accept, though they have said in the past that they don't like such changes. (It'd be interesting to know if other layers of the stack end up forbidding ^ or if you can connect to a server that uses it anyway, in particular if Safari has a problem with this.)

Note that the reason the URL Standard is somewhat "liberal" has two reasons:

1. Despite various definitions of hosts existing, browsers don't enforce them fully (in particular in other layers than the URL parser) and therefore servers end up relying on them. (E.g., a Google server has been known to use an underscore. Various servers use hosts that look like IDNA but are not, etc.)
2. For better or worse URLs can carry other hosts than those allowed by DNS and this is also supported by browsers to various degrees.

FWIW in my testing, webkit (Epiphany on Linux) seems to not parse `^` as `%5E` in the path section either...

I'm guessing this will eventually lead to some "sec-high" level issues at some point if we don't fix it, but sec-moderate for now. We can't rely on DNS to outlaw bad characters, because bad people can write their own nameservers (e.g. note comment above about the google server with illegal '\_' in the name).

So a potential problem here is that for [non-special URLs](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#is-not-special), e.g., `test://test^test/`, no browser currently fails parsing. Not all end up treating `test^test` as the hostname, but Safari does (and the URL Standard requires it). We could make that continue to work however and hope we never create origins with hosts et al out of non-special URLs...

I think it may be OK to fix this for special URIs only, as those would be the only ones that the browser actually loads.

The assertion fails at [nsPermissionManager.cpp - mozsearch](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/f8b11433159cbc9cc80500b3e579d767473fa539/extensions/permissions/nsPermissionManager.cpp#191) because we are trying to build a uri from "http://", clearly invalid - built by OriginAttributes.PopulateFromOrigin as 'no suffix' from "http://^".

I think the problem is not to load something wrong, the problem is that you could possibly spoof our OA isolation logic just by creation of a URL being passed around, for which '^' falls in to the part we consider as origin. We cut at the first '^' occurrence, kinda unpredictably, creating randomly broken origins. So, I'd vote for disabling this for all scheme's origins (make it early and clearly fail); but the reason behind would only be because we use it to separate the OA string in origins, internally in Gecko...

It's probably a good idea, since now we have that fix. That change should not be risky, so I will ask for an uplift. Whether it happens at the same time or a week later than this uplift, it's likely not important, considered we indeed broke URLs in the past already.

Anyway it won't solve all the problems, we still need a global strategy to remove urls that suddently become invalid from history, for which we have opened [Bug 1557445](/show_bug.cgi?id=1557445 "NEW - Strategy to identify and remove invalid urls").

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

I was looking at upgrading Activity Stream to the latest eslint-plugin-mozilla, which also starts enabling rules from eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized.
It raised an error here:
<https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/019fdbda6f3a07a4f8cb2beccba8e5ff14926cc8/system-addon/content-src/lib/snippets.js#L253>
// Note that injecting snippets can throw if they're invalid XML.
snippetsEl.innerHTML = payload;
activity-stream/system-addon/content-src/lib/snippets.js (1/0)
✖ 253:5 Unsafe assignment to innerHTML no-unsanitized/property
I couldn't see any code that was sanitizing the payload, but it seems an intentional assignment to innerHTML.
I don't know where the payload is coming from, hence raising the issue to get it documented.

This is existing code ported from the old aboutHome.js (<http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/browser/base/content/abouthome/aboutHome.js#334>) which is required for the existing snippets service to run.
Payloads come from the snippets service, the code for which lives here <https://github.com/mozmeao/snippets-service> and the documentation for which lives here <https://abouthome-snippets-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>.
We brought this up during our security review and they were aware of it.
Our team would like to move to an approach that receives JSON only from the service and implement all templates in Firefox, however because it would require a rewrite of the entire system for a team that is really small (there are only a couple of folks who work on the service), it was determined that a rewrite for 57 would be out of scope.
That said, I'd like to try to resolve this as soon as possible. Hopefully we'll be able to get the resources to be able to fix it for 58.

Yes, this is a known weakness that's been carried over from aboutHome.js. The notable difference is that about:home did not contain any sensitive information (e.g., history), but ActivityStream does.
That leads me to the following questions:
Do we expect active markup like <script> tags in snippets?
If yes, who owns the risk of a compromised snippet service
If no, do we have an HTML/XML sanitizer in ActivityStream that could clean out active markup (like script tags)?
I know we can do something like this in chrome-JS code:
> let uri = NetUtil.newURI(document.baseURI);
> let fragment = parserUtils.parseFragment(stringThatMayContainXSS, parserUtils.SanitizerAllowComments, true, uri, embeddingDiv);
> embeddingDiv.appendChild(fragment);

Yes, there's expected to be active markup. Here's an example of snippets payload:
view-source:https://snippets.mozilla.com/show/7314/
Line 69 has a var ABOUTHOME\_SNIPPETS = JSON.parse('…
Then ABOUTHOME\_SNIPPETS[0].code contains html including css and <script> (inline), in this case:
138: "<script type=\"text/javascript\">"
139: " //<![CDATA["
140: " (function() {"
141: " var snippet = document.getElementById('snippet');"
Also to be clear about the user content of Activity Stream, it contains top sites urls, bookmarks, and recent history. Additionally, sometimes those are shown with screenshots -- for top sites 560x380 -- that could have been captured of a logged in state, e.g., email.

Can we still find a way to disable access to the other ActivityStream sections?
What do we expect the scripts to do, generally?
I'm thinking of embedding the snippet HTML into an <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation" srcdoc="...">.
NB: This rewrite is a great chance to improve Firefox's security in a meaningful way, by not trusting the snippet server more than we have to.

In the past, snippets have been able to take over the whole page if necessary. It looks like typically they are just a rectangular section anchored to the bottom of the screen taking up the whole width. So, maybe the snippets content can be loaded into an iframe, k88hudson?Flags: needinfo?(khudson)

The script tags are needed because they contain custom logic related to each individual snippet (e.g. deciding which users to target given profile age, deciding which snippet to randomly select) as well as the code that attaches to various parts of the HTML elements in templates (the submit button, the block button). I do think this functionality could be implemented in Firefox if we do the rewrite to land the templates into a system add-on and make the service return JSON, it will just require some engineering time.
The snippet service is currently managed by :giorgos (giorgos@mozilla.com) if you need more info about it.
Using an iframe wouldn’t be ideal since the snippet is not always preset / has to appear and hide dynamically on the page, can be variable height, and needs to respond to changes in the Activity Stream UI. Our impression from our initial discussion with security reviewers was that the existing approach was acceptable for this release and could be improved in the future, but we will schedule an additional meeting with them to make sure we’re doing the right thing here.Flags: needinfo?(khudson)

Oh, to be clear, this bug is \_not\_ about blocking the release.
Just figuring out if this is a good opportunity to how change how things work.

I'm looking to upgrade Activity Stream's eslint-plugin-mozilla version for some other things I'm doing. As part of that, it'll pull in eslint-plugin-no-unsanitized and I'll need to whitelist the issue in the source (// eslint-disable-next-line no-unsanitized/property)
Are we happy with that? Or should we wait until we resolve this?Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

Probably doesn't make that much of a difference, but we could generally disable no-unsanitized/property if we don't want to point directly at that line… (Although someone who really was digging would just easily run with the rule erroring and disabling generally could accidentally miss a new unsanitized added to code.)

(Taking Dan's needinfo, as I've looked at the code recently)
I think it's OK to whitelist this instance of innerHTML:
The snippet service is an "intendex XSS" that's been known for a while: Snippets authors can write code that will appear for all of our users.
Though the risk is increasing with snippets moving from about:home to ActivityStream, it's still limited to authors on our snippets service.
And btw we're re-reviewing the service and it's publishing process in [bug 1408972](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408972 "NEW"), which will hopefully allow us to mitigate the risk even more.Flags: needinfo?(dveditz)

I think here's a likely path forward:
Remove the <div> and use <iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-top-navigation" srcdoc="...">.
Due to the new – isolated – security context, the snippets code which will lose direct access to IndexedDB. To retain functionality, all access to gSnippestMap have to be remoted, i.e., turned into a postMessage protocol that proxies access for the snippets iframe.
I have carefully reviewed the usage of IndexedDB and consider them OK to be shared with the potentially harmful snippets code:
This will be the most work, but seems quite manageable. Another bit of work will be around hiding and showing the iframe and styling it appropriately, as Kate mentioned in [comment 6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1408349#c6 "RESOLVED FIXED - Possible unsanitized write to innerHTML for Activity Stream's snippets").
P.S: I had a chat with Andrei to help me understand how ActivityStream works, but all potential flaws in this proposal are completely mine :)

There was some discussion in Austin with Snippets people about moving to some structured snippets, so activity stream would control the display of this content. k88hudson, do you have a bug open for that design and work?

Could we host the scripts externally and use CSP and a sanitizer to avoid the use of inline script entirely, relying on a set of allowed-by-CSP https-secured mozilla.org domains to further restrict what script runs even when script does run in the iframe?

ASRouter powered snippets was preffed on for all channels in [bug 1518619](/show_bug.cgi?id=1518619 "VERIFIED FIXED - Pref on ASR Snippets for 65 Beta and Release"). [Bug 1540939](/show_bug.cgi?id=1540939 "VERIFIED FIXED - Remove SnippetsFeed and related components") will be removing the old snippets code. Additionally [bug 1500061](/show_bug.cgi?id=1500061 "RESOLVED FIXED - TIghten CSP for activity stream") is to tighten up CSP now that we don't inject snippets scripts.

#### [#CVE-2019-11711: Script injection within domain through inner window reuse](#CVE-2019-11711)

Reporter
Boris Zbarsky
Impact
high
##### Description

When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of `document.domain` for cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use `document.domain`, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on the other subdomain, even those that did not use `document.domain` to relax their origin security.

#### [#CVE-2019-11712: Cross-origin POST requests can be made with NPAPI plugins by following 308 redirects](#CVE-2019-11712)

Reporter
Gregory Smiley of Security Compass
Impact
high
##### Description

POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

Reporter
Henry Corrigan-Gibbs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure.

#### [#CVE-2019-11730: Same-origin policy treats all files in a directory as having the same-origin](#CVE-2019-11730)

Reporter
Luigi Gubello
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use `file:` URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. Luigi Gubello demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.

#### [#CVE-2019-11709: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 60.8, and Thunderbird 60.8](#CVE-2019-11709)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Andreea Pavel, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jason Kratzer, and Jeff Gilbert reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67, Firefox ESR 60.7, and Thunderbird 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11715.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11717.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11716 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11716)

#### Description

Until explicitly accessed by script, window.globalThis is not enumerable and, as a result, is not visible to code such as Object.getOwnPropertyNames(window). Sites that deploy a sandboxing that depends on enumerating and freezing access to the window object may miss this, allowing their sandboxes to be bypassed. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 68.

# CVE-2019-11730

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11729.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11733.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11730 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11730)

#### Description

A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use file: URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. It was demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.

[Test C program that exercises the potential bug in PK11\_ImportDERPrivateKeyInfoAndReturnKey](attachment.cgi?id=9054765)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9054765&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0

Steps to reproduce:

The attached C program exercises the bug. To reproduce:

1. Import a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8 format using `PK11_ImportDERPrivateKeyInfoAndReturnKey`, where one or more of the leading bytes of the key is 0x00. The import operation succeeds. I am importing a key in the format used here:

   <https://searchfox.org/nss/rev/cfd5fcba7efbfe116e2c08848075240ec3a92718/gtests/pk11_gtest/pk11_curve25519_unittest.cc#66>
2. Try to use the private key for DH key agreement (e.g., with `PK11_PubDeriveWithKDF`). The operation succeeds but returns an incorrect results. Furthermore, in the process, the operation makes what I believe is an OOB read.

Actual results:

1. When importing a key using `PK11_ImportDERPrivateKeyInfoAndReturnKey`, the import operation strips leading 0x00 bytes from the private key:

   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pk11wrap/pk11pk12.c#530>
2. Later on, when using `PK11_PubDeriveWithKDF` to use this secret curve25519 key to derive a DH secret, `ECDH_Derive` is invoked here:

   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ec.c#523>
3. I believe that `ECDH_Derive` then invokes `ec_Curve25519_mul` here:

   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ecl/ecp_25519.c#l>

   Notice that `ec_Curve25519_mul` assumes that the input secret `s` is 32 bytes long:

   <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ecl/curve25519_32.c#370>

If the leading zeros have been truncated, then `s` is < 32 bytes and we will have an OOB read. In addition, the operation returns an incorrect answer.

Expected results:

OPTION 1: The `CKA_VALUE` parameter for Curve25519 keys should not have their leading 0x00 bytes stripped in when importing:

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pk11wrap/pk11pk12.c#513>

There should be an assertion somewhere in this code to check that the `CKA_VALUE` string is exactly 32 bytes long when the key represents a Curve25519 public key.

(I haven't tested it, but I suspect that the `CKA_EC_POINT` parameter shouldn't have it's leading 0x00 bytes stripped either.)

OPTION 2: In `ec_Curve25519_mul`, rewrite the code to handle the case when the secret key `s` has length < 32 bytes. In particular, the mul code could add leading 0x00 bytes to pad the secret key up to 32 bytes.

This looks like it would be doable from WebCrypto, so I'm going to give this an initial categorization of sec-moderate as the corruption there would be in the content process. Since right now it looks like it's only a read, sec-low might be more appropriate, but I err upwards.

I have a local fix for this using Option 2, as IMHO it's less likely to cause unintended consequences (the downside being that we may have similar bugs elsewhere, which won't be fixed by this patch. I'd like to spend a little time reviewing for such cases...)

Regarding the public `CKA_EC_POINT` length check: currently the leading 0x00 bytes will be stripped and we'll [reject](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ecl/ecp_25519.c#113) the key for being short. Is this behavior we want to keep? There seems to be some debate over what level of validation is needed on Curve25519 public keys ([1](https://cr.yp.to/ecdh.html), [2](https://vnhacker.blogspot.com/2015/09/why-not-validating-curve25519-public.html), [3](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000896.html)). If there are interoperability concerns from being too restrictive, we may want to loosen the check to allow padding with zero-bytes. Note that on the ECDH\_Derive call path, we already [check](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ec.c#549) the public against [forbiddenValues](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ecl/ecp_25519.c#27), including (0,0).

So I think that for curves with fixed input size, we should be preserving leading zeros. We should not even be looking at the values of key voters, public or private. But that was not good when I tried to do it generically. I have a patch that breaks everything.

If we're able to do option 1 without hitting too much code, that would be much better.

We can simply preserve based on the key and attribute types. Then we have two possibilities:

1. The encoded value is the expected length (including any and all leading-zeros), everything works correctly.
2. The encoded value is shorter than expected, in which case simply preserving didn't help us. We could either reject such private keys, or copy the bytes into a fixed size buffer prior to ec\_mul. Any concerns with doing the former?

Adding to the above... Choosing to not strip zeros for EC is essentially whitelistng at a higher level based on the key type, e.g.:

```
for (ap = signedattr; signedcount; ap++, signedcount--) {
    if (keyType == CKK_EC) {
        if (ap->type == CKA_EC_POINT ||
            ap->type == CKA_VALUE)
            continue;
    }
    pk11_SignedToUnsigned(ap);
}

```

This feels like breaking encapsulation, and in looking at usages of 'pk11\_SignedToUnsigned', a [comment](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pk11wrap/pk11akey.c#1076) suggests it may not be simple to use this behavior globally. Further, any future callers of ecp\_25519.c could re-expose the same bug (or a SECFailure) if they don't account for this.

[ecp\_256\_32.c](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/freebl/ecl/ecp_256_32.c#1446) will pad to ORDER\_LEN, and lib/freebl/rsa.c will handle either case (i.e. leading-0 present or not).

I still think option 2 is the cleaner approach here (perhaps with a future code review item requiring implementations to handle this gracefully...)

Does this seem reasonable?

The thing I'm worried about is creating timing side channels out of private values.

In all cases, we should have a private value that is the same size as the group. We should not be looking at the octets except in the context of performing constant-time operations on that value. Any fixup we do is just going to leak. Sure, it's low probability, and we have blinding for the truly awful cases (hello RSA), but as a principle, we should not be doing this.

Thus, the ideal state is for us to take opaque octets, and save them without looking at them. When we import them, we test that there are the right number of bits and error out. When we use them, the same test is redundant, but we should check anyway.

However, I realize that we don't have that right now. So I would suggest this instead: don't strip leading zeros at all for any key. See if that works. It probably doesn't for all keys (I had a hell of a time with DSA and DH if I remember rightly). Then for those that break without trimmed leading zeros, add them to a list of safe options. Open a bug for each one to investigate why they break and see if that can be fixed.

Does that make sense?

That makes sense; I had the same concern about the padding calculation/timing side channel but didn't want to start a larger refactor without buy in.

Thanks for the feedback!

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHSA-2019%3A1951)

## Topic

An update for nss and nspr is now available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

Red Hat Product Security has rated this update as having a security impact of Moderate. A Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score, which gives a detailed severity rating, is available for each vulnerability from the CVE link(s) in the References section.

## Description

Network Security Services (NSS) is a set of libraries designed to support the cross-platform development of security-enabled client and server applications.

Netscape Portable Runtime (NSPR) provides platform independence for non-GUI operating system facilities.

The following packages have been upgraded to a later upstream version: nss (3.44.0), nspr (4.21.0). (BZ#1713187, BZ#1713188)

Security Fix(es):

* nss: NULL pointer dereference in several CMS functions resulting in a denial of service (CVE-2018-18508)
* nss: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key (CVE-2019-11719)
* nss: Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault (CVE-2019-11729)
* nss: PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be used for TLS 1.3 (CVE-2019-11727)

For more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.

Bug Fix(es):

* PQG verify fails when create DSA PQG parameters because the counts aren't returned correctly. (BZ#1685325)
* zeroization of AES context missing (BZ#1719629)
* RSA Pairwise consistency test (BZ#1719630)
* FIPS updated for nss-softoken POST (BZ#1722373)
* DH/ECDH key tests missing for the PG parameters (BZ#1722374)
* NSS should implement continuous random test on it's seed data or use the kernel AF\_ALG interface for random (BZ#1725059)
* support setting supported signature algorithms in strsclnt utility (BZ#1725110)
* certutil -F with no parameters is killed with segmentation fault message (BZ#1725115)
* NSS: Support for IKE/IPsec typical PKIX usage so libreswan can use nss without rejecting certs based on EKU (BZ#1725116)
* NSS should use getentropy() for seeding its RNG, not /dev/urandom. Needs update to NSS 3.37 (BZ#1725117)
* Disable TLS 1.3 in FIPS mode (BZ#1725773)
* Wrong alert sent when client uses PKCS#1 signatures in TLS 1.3 (BZ#1728259)
* x25519 allowed in FIPS mode (BZ#1728260)
* post handshake authentication with selfserv does not work if SSL\_ENABLE\_SESSION\_TICKETS is set (BZ#1728261)

Enhancement(s):

* Move IKEv1 and IKEv2 KDF's from libreswan to nss-softkn (BZ#1719628)

## Solution

For details on how to apply this update, which includes the changes described in this advisory, refer to:

<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258>

After installing this update, applications using NSS or NSPR (for example, Firefox) must be restarted for this update to take effect.

#### [#CVE-2019-11711: Script injection within domain through inner window reuse](#CVE-2019-11711)

Reporter
Boris Zbarsky
Impact
high
##### Description

When an inner window is reused, it does not consider the use of `document.domain` for cross-origin protections. If pages on different subdomains ever cooperatively use `document.domain`, then either page can abuse this to inject script into arbitrary pages on the other subdomain, even those that did not use `document.domain` to relax their origin security.

#### [#CVE-2019-11712: Cross-origin POST requests can be made with NPAPI plugins by following 308 redirects](#CVE-2019-11712)

Reporter
Gregory Smiley of Security Compass
Impact
high
##### Description

POST requests made by NPAPI plugins, such as Flash, that receive a status 308 redirect response can bypass CORS requirements. This can allow an attacker to perform Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

##### References

* [Bug 1543804](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1543804)

#### [#CVE-2019-11713: Use-after-free with HTTP/2 cached stream](#CVE-2019-11713)

Reporter
Hanno Böck
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur in HTTP/2 when a cached HTTP/2 stream is closed while still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11729: Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault](#CVE-2019-11729)

Reporter
Jonas Allmann
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Empty or malformed p256-ECDH public keys may trigger a segmentation fault due values being improperly sanitized before being copied into memory and used.

##### References

* [Bug 1515342](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1515342)

#### [#CVE-2019-11715: HTML parsing error can contribute to content XSS](#CVE-2019-11715)

Reporter
Linus Särud
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Due to an error while parsing page content, it is possible for properly sanitized user input to be misinterpreted and lead to XSS hazards on web sites in certain circumstances.

##### References

* [Bug 1555523](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1555523)

#### [#CVE-2019-11717: Caret character improperly escaped in origins](#CVE-2019-11717)

Reporter
Tyson Smith
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists where the caret ("^") character is improperly escaped constructing some URIs due to it being used as a separator, allowing for possible spoofing of origin attributes.

#### [#CVE-2019-11719: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key](#CVE-2019-11719)

Reporter
Henry Corrigan-Gibbs
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure.

##### References

* [Bug 1540541](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1540541)

#### [#CVE-2019-11730: Same-origin policy treats all files in a directory as having the same-origin](#CVE-2019-11730)

Reporter
Luigi Gubello
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists where if a user opens a locally saved HTML file, this file can use `file:` URIs to access other files in the same directory or sub-directories if the names are known or guessed. The Fetch API can then be used to read the contents of any files stored in these directories and they may uploaded to a server. Luigi Gubello demonstrated that in combination with a popular Android messaging app, if a malicious HTML attachment is sent to a user and they opened that attachment in Firefox, due to that app's predictable pattern for locally-saved file names, it is possible to read attachments the victim received from other correspondents.

#### [#CVE-2019-11709: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 68 and Firefox ESR 60.8](#CVE-2019-11709)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Andreea Pavel, Christian Holler, Honza Bambas, Jason Kratzer, and Jeff Gilbert reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 67 and Firefox ESR 60.7. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
