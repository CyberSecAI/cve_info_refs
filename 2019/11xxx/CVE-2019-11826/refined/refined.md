- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Relative path traversal vulnerability in the `SYNO.PhotoTeam.Upload.Item` component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path traversal, allowing writing to arbitrary locations.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote authenticated users can upload arbitrary files to the system.
- **Attack vectors**: Network, exploiting the `name` parameter during file upload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user access to the vulnerable service is required. User interaction is required.
