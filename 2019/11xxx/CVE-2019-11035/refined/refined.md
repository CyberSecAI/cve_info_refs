    "description": "When processing certain files, PHP EXIF extension in versions 7.1.x below 7.1.28, 7.2.x below 7.2.17 and 7.3.x below 7.3.4 can be caused to read past allocated buffer in exif_iif_add_value function. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.",
    "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer over-read in the exif_iif_add_value function.",
    "impact": "A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.",
    "attack_vector": "The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the processing of crafted JPEG images with specific EXIF tags.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "A remote attacker needs to be able to send a crafted JPEG image to the affected system. This could be achieved through various means, including uploading the image through a web interface, sending the image as an email attachment, etc."
