Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-11279:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Cloud Foundry UAA (User Account and Authentication) handles scope requests. Specifically, when an array of requested scopes is submitted, UAA versions prior to 74.1.0 can grant scopes that should not be allowed for a client.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Malicious users can escalate their own privileges by requesting unauthorized scopes.
- **Scope Manipulation:** The vulnerability is rooted in the improper handling of scope requests via arrays.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Control:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain full control over UAA and any resources managed by it.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attack can be carried out remotely by a malicious user.
- **Malicious Scope Request:** The attacker sends a manipulated array of requested scopes to UAA.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the UAA instance.
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs to be a valid user to attempt to escalate privileges.

**Summary:**
CVE-2019-11279 allows a remote malicious user to escalate privileges within the Cloud Foundry UAA by sending a crafted request with an array of scopes, granting them unauthorized access to the UAA and its managed resources. This is a critical vulnerability due to the potential for complete system compromise.
