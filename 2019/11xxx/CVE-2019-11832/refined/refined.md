The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11832.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the way TYPO3 CMS handles image processing, specifically when using ImageMagick (or GraphicsMagick). The system identifies the mime-type of the source data to invoke appropriate coders, and if an attacker uploads an image file containing PostScript code, that code could be executed by ImageMagick when generating visual previews or thumbnails. This occurs because ImageMagick uses the GhostScript interpreter to convert PostScript and PDF content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Arbitrary code execution vulnerability due to insecure processing of PostScript code within image files.
- Lack of proper validation of file mime-types before processing with ImageMagick.
- Reliance on ImageMagick policy.xml settings that may not be strict enough by default.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the server system by uploading a specially crafted image containing PostScript code which will be executed when the system attempts to process the image.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a malicious image with PostScript code via backend filelist module (requires a valid backend user account).
- Uploading a malicious image with PostScript code via a vulnerable frontend application that allows file uploads and previews without mime-type validation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to either have a valid backend user account with access to the filelist module or have access to a frontend application which allows uploading and previewing files without proper mime-type validation.
- The server system needs to have the GhostScript binary `gs` available.
- ImageMagick policy.xml settings should not be strict and must allow processing of PostScript/PDF.
