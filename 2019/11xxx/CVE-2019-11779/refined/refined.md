Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-11779:

**Root Cause:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient parsing of MQTT SUBSCRIBE packets.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a malicious MQTT client sends a SUBSCRIBE packet with a topic containing an excessive number of '/' characters (topic hierarchy separators).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Insufficient input validation for topic hierarchy depth in MQTT SUBSCRIBE packets.
- Lack of proper bounds checking when processing the topic string, allowing for a very long topic string to be pushed onto the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit results in a stack overflow, which leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The Mosquitto daemon crashes, interrupting MQTT broker services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, utilizing the MQTT protocol.
- A malicious MQTT client is required to initiate the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish an MQTT client connection to the vulnerable Mosquitto broker.
- The attacker must be able to send specially crafted MQTT SUBSCRIBE packets with an overly deep topic hierarchy.
- No authentication appears to be required to trigger the vulnerability as it is related to parsing of the SUBSCRIBE packet, not user permissions.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Eclipse Mosquitto versions 1.5.0 to 1.6.5.
- The vulnerability can be triggered with a topic string containing approximately 65400 or more '/' characters.
- The fix limits the topic hierarchy depth to 200 levels.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is addressed by restricting the maximum allowed topic hierarchy depth to 200.
- Patches and updated packages are available from various Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Fedora, and openSUSE.
