CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11840 CVE-2019-11841 CVE-2020-9283

CVE-2019-11840

    An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka
    golang-googlecode-go-crypto. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is
    generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the amd64
    implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle back to
    previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead to loss of
    confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictability in CSPRNG
    applications.

CVE-2019-11841

    A message-forgery issue was discovered in
    crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in supplementary Go cryptography
    libraries. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest
    algorithm(s) used for the signature. Since the library skips Armor Header
    parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers,
    but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating
    the signatures.

CVE-2020-9283

    golang.org/x/crypto allows a panic during signature verification in the
    golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package. A client can attack an SSH server that accepts
    public keys. Also, a server can attack any SSH client.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1:0.0~git20170407.0.55a552f+REALLY.0.0~git20161012.0.5f31782-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-go.crypto packages.

Debian Bug     : 952462

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in golang-go.crypto, the
supplementary Go cryptography libraries.

CVE-2019-11840

    An issue was discovered in supplementary Go cryptography libraries, aka
    golang-googlecode-go-crypto. If more than 256 GiB of keystream is
    generated, or if the counter otherwise grows greater than 32 bits, the
    amd64 implementation will first generate incorrect output, and then cycle
    back to previously generated keystream. Repeated keystream bytes can lead
    to loss of confidentiality in encryption applications, or to predictability
    in CSPRNG applications.

CVE-2019-11841

    A message-forgery issue was discovered in
    crypto/openpgp/clearsign/clearsign.go in supplementary Go cryptography
    libraries. The "Hash" Armor Header specifies the message digest
    algorithm(s) used for the signature. Since the library skips Armor Header
    parsing in general, an attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor Headers,
    but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages without invalidating
    the signatures.

CVE-2020-9283

    golang.org/x/crypto allows a panic during signature verification in the
    golang.org/x/crypto/ssh package. A client can attack an SSH server that
    accepts public keys. Also, a server can attack any SSH client.

The following Go packages have been rebuilt in order to fix the aforementioned
issues.

rclone: 1.45-3+deb10u1
obfs4proxy: 0.0.7-4+deb10u1
gobuster: 2.0.1-1+deb10u1
restic: 0.9.4+ds-2+deb10u1
gopass: 1.2.0-2+deb10u1
aptly: 1.3.0+ds1-2.2~deb10u2:
dnscrypt-proxy: 2.0.19+ds1-2+deb10u1
g10k: 0.5.7-1+deb10u1
hub: 2.7.0~ds1-1+deb10u1
acmetool: 0.0.62-3+deb10u1
syncthing: 1.0.0~ds1-1+deb10u1
packer: 1.3.4+dfsg-4+deb10u1
etcd: 3.2.26+dfsg-3+deb10u1
notary: 0.6.1~ds1-3+deb10u1

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1:0.0~git20181203.505ab14-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-go.crypto packages.

Hash: SHA256

Package        : golang-go.crypto
Version        : 0.0~hg190-1+deb8u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11841

This package ignored the value of the Hash header, which allows an
attacker to spoof it. An attacker can not only embed arbitrary Armor
Headers, but also prepend arbitrary text to cleartext messages
without invalidating the signatures.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
0.0~hg190-1+deb8u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-go.crypto packages.
