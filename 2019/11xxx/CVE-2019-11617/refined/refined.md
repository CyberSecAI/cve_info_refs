Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-11617:

**CVE-2019-11617: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in `doorgets/app/requests/user/configurationRequest.php`**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability exists because the `configurationRequest.php` script, when handling the `analytics` action, lacks proper CSRF token validation. Specifically, it's missing the check `if (!empty($this->doorGets->Form->i) && empty($this->doorGets->Form->e))`. This allows an attacker to submit unauthorized requests by bypassing the intended security checks.

*   **Weakness:** Insufficient CSRF protection. The application fails to verify that the request originated from a legitimate user session and not from a malicious site.

*  **Impact:**
    *   A remote attacker can modify the "Google Analytics code" of the website.
    *   This can lead to the injection of malicious scripts or tracking of user behavior without the site owner's authorization.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attack is performed via a specially crafted web page with a form that submits a request to the vulnerable `configurationRequest.php` script.
    *   The malicious form targets the analytics configuration update feature
    *   The attacker hosts the malicious page and tricks an authenticated administrator into visiting it, causing the browser to automatically submit the crafted request.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to trick an authenticated administrator into visiting a malicious webpage they control.
    *   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated themselves; they leverage the administrator's existing session.

**Technical Details from the provided document:**

The provided HTML content includes a sample malicious HTML page that demonstrates the attack. This page contains a form that automatically submits a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint:

```html
<html>
  <!-- CSRF PoC - generated by Burp Suite Professional -->
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="http://127.0.0.1:8003/dg-user/?controller=configuration&action=analytics" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="hidden" name="configuration_analytics_analytics" value="3333" />
      <input type="hidden" name="configuration_analytics_submit" value="Save" />
    </form>
	<script>document.forms[0].submit();</script>
  </body>
</html>
```

When an administrator visits this page, their browser sends a POST request containing the malicious Google Analytics code ("3333") to the vulnerable `configurationRequest.php` script on their behalf. Due to the missing CSRF token check, the script processes the request, effectively updating the website's analytics configuration.
