Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-11937

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Carbon protocol reader within Mcrouter. Specifically, the `CarbonProtocolReader::skip` function recursively calls itself when encountering nested structures. A large, deeply nested struct input can lead to excessive recursion, causing stack exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unbounded Recursion:** The `skip` function doesn't limit the depth of nested structs, causing a stack overflow if the nesting is too deep.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** There is no check on the size or depth of the struct being read by the Carbon protocol reader, allowing an attacker to send maliciously crafted input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Stack exhaustion leads to the mcrouter process crashing, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending a specially crafted Carbon protocol message containing a very large and deeply nested struct to an mcrouter instance using the vulnerable Carbon protocol reader.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to a vulnerable mcrouter service.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Carbon protocol message.
