User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.101 Safari/537.36
Steps to reproduce:
The .JNLP (Java web start app) should be treated as executable.
Visit: <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/webstart/deploying.html>
Press 'Launch'
Actual results:
The downloaded file is not treated as executable.
Expected results:
Given that the result of this file is that Java is executed then this should be the same as .jar files. Granted, initially these files are always opened with restricted mode, but apparently they can be signed to bypass this. I don't think it's far fetched to imagine someone malicious is capable of signing these with rogue certs.
Also, (hate to do this) but Google Chrome treats it as dangerous.

Yes, we really should.
The one in ApplicationReputation.cpp comes from [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/chrome/browser/resources/safe\_browsing/download\_file\_types.asciipb](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/master/chrome/browser/resources/safe_browsing/download_file_types.asciipb), which I monitor.

There's ".pdf" in there though, that I'm pretty sure we don't want to warn about being executable, although apparently we may still want to scan for malware. I know some document types may contain dangerous macros when used with certain viewers, or they can be used to trigger security bugs, but this is true of any downloaded document type regardless of type. To be useful, the list would have to be curated based on real-world usage.

Ok, so maybe we do need two lists:
1. list of executables (in nsLocalFile\*)
2. list of files to scan (in ApplicationReputation)
but the second would make use of the first and not include any entries that we already consider executable.
Then whenever Chrome adds new executables to their list, we can decide which of these lists it should be added to.
Also, we should never remove anything from the first list without adding it to the second.

I filed [bug 1472631](/show_bug.cgi?id=1472631 "NEW - Investigate serving the list of executable files remotely or in a hotfixable way") to investigate serving the list of extensions in nsLocalFile in a hotfixable way. I don't know if a similar bug exists or is needed for the list in ApplicationReputation.
In the meantime, apart from ".jnlp", are there other file extensions from the list used by Chrome that we should add to the nsLocalFile list?Flags: needinfo?(francois)

So far, the updates have not been frequent enough to justify investing a lot of time in making this list more dynamic.Flags: needinfo?(francois)

Hi, This issue seems to be Fixed on windows 10 in the latest Firefox Beta - 67.0b3, I will mark this issue accordingly. Please note that I don't have access to all available extensions mentioned in [Comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1392955#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - JNLP should be treated as executable") and I confirmed this bug based on the file from its Description.

If anybody else has any links that might redirect me to those other extension files, I'll be happy to check those as well.

I believe this bug is an error or oversight. FWIW, I run Java SE Product management at Oracle, and we've had a good relationship with the Firefox team dating back to 2013 or so. Unfortunately it would seem a lot of the people we used to work with are gone (Coates, Smedberg come to mind), or perhaps someone would have thought to reach out to myself or someone from Oracle to help work through this.

This change has caused harm and is causing your users to switch back to Chrome, Safari and Edge for their WebStart needs. Ironically these are the users that had switched to you years ago because you were offering the best and safest experience.

JNLP is not an executable. JNLP should be treated the same as any Word Document. A JNLP file will not cause execution on a system unless it has a valid signature, and the user explicitly authorizes the launching based on information provided by the signature. Moreover, we even check if the Java runtime (if there is one) is current, and prompt the user to update if required, something you wouldn't experience with a docx file, for example. We're happy to discuss with anyone at Mozilla, I would reach out but as I already noted, apparently our contacts are all long gone.

For enterprise applications it would be helpful to define trusted domains or at least remove the jnlp from this list to avoid the message confusing users. Or at least to have a remember this page as secure.

Any chance to implement this?

I second Donald Smith on this, a JNLP is NOT an executable. Java is launched, but before the downloaded jars are run, the user has to confirm if he really wants to execute the application.

It impacts the usability of our enterprise application, because now every time a user want to run our app, a new file is downloaded in his download folder, and he has to make sure to then click on the latest version of this file, otherwise it won't work (each run gives a different JNLP file because of credentials).

And now instead of these jnlp files being hidden in a temp folder (which can be automatically cleaned), they accumulate in his download folder, where they have absolutely no value.

Please reconsider, or at least implement what Johannes Michler has suggested.

To stop the immediate pain for organizations that use Java Web Start we are backing out the fix for this bug from ESR-68 in [bug 1576616](/show_bug.cgi?id=1576616 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should not treat JNLP files as Executables (revert bug 1392955) on ESR-68").

(In reply to Thierry Guérin from [comment #18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1392955#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - JNLP should be treated as executable"))

> I second Donald Smith on this, a JNLP is NOT an executable. Java is launched, but before the downloaded jars are run, the user has to confirm if he really wants to execute the application.

You just described an executable. You can argue that a prompt from Java is good enough that Firefox doesn't also need to prompt, but you can't say it's not an executable. In any case there are obvious problems with the user interactions here that we should address. In particular it shouldn't behave *worse* than downloading an actual .exe. There are also platform disparities we need to address. This fixed bug is not the place to address those issues so I'm filing a new bug for that. I suppose [bug 1576616](/show_bug.cgi?id=1576616 "RESOLVED FIXED - Should not treat JNLP files as Executables (revert bug 1392955) on ESR-68") could have been that, but 1) we took that over to land a fix on ESR, and 2) the usability issues are bigger than just JNLP.

Thanks Daniel!

It feels like we're using different meanings for "executable". jnlp is just like a docx file -- it isn't executable itself, but does trigger a separately installed application (Microsoft Word) to execute with it. If a user doesn't have Word installed, the OS would ask what to do with it, ditto for Java and JNLP. It feels from our perspective they (.jnlp and .docx) should be treated similarly.

Happy to discuss or elaborate, and glad to hear the immediate pain point can be managed.

This is a disagreement we're unlikely to resolve. To us a word file is fundamentally a "document" like HTML while Java is a programming language.

By that reasoning a word file should also be considered an executable, considering word documents can contain macros and scripting in VBA, a programming language. The same kind of safeguards apply to that as to JNLP (user is explicitly prompted before execution). Same for excel, and any other document that has extended scripting capabilities.

I have to agree with Donald here that you shouldn't treat this any differently.

Facing the same problem I found one workaround. Add following example content to the `"mimeTypes"` collection in handlers.json located in %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\xxxxxxxx.default. Afterwards you will be able to assign any program you like to open jnlp with in Firefox settings.

`"application/x-java-jnlp-file":{"action":2,"handlers":[{"name":"start-jre.bat","path":"C:\\JRE\\start-jre.bat"}],"extensions":["jnlp"]}`

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20180206200532
Steps to reproduce:
1) Navigate to <https://twomastersmedia.com/iops/?c5aa9d589430490ftfn1d5aa9d58943083=(888)%20498-4480># (note this is a website that tries to capture all events, so it's hard to get out of it)
2) Move the cursor around in the area with the red background
3) Move the cursor to the Firefox's top bar buttons (Home button / Hamburger Menu, etc) or Address bar. Click the mouse.
Special note: keep slowly moving the mouse cursor upward toward the top of the screen, it will "go off the top" and then appear again slightly below the top bar. That's the "real cursor" and all clicks are registered by that.
Actual results:
Nothing happens, it appears the click is not registered. Note that if you click and drag downward a bit, it highlights some text on the webpage itself!
Expected results:
The click should have been received by Firefox.
Note: it appears to be caused by a fake cursor - shouldn't Firefox prevent that somehow?

In my opinion the behaviour is the malware site's fault and as far as I know Firefox has no special mechanism in place for this.
My advice would be to avoid entering malware sites.
Given the above, I'll close the issue es Invalid.Status: UNCONFIRMED → RESOLVEDClosed: 7 years agoResolution: --- → INVALID

David, just to make sure I've expressed my view of the problem clearly - do we expect Firefox to allow a custom cursor to be drawn over-top of the Address Bar in Firefox? Seems like a bad thing to me that the browser should disallow as it is being used by an evil website.
Yeah, obviously avoiding the website is a good thing to do. The reason I filed this bug is because I believe it indicates a problem with the browser that this evil website is exploiting.

This site is not blocked by SafeBrowsing. If we think it's a malicious site we should report it so it gets blocked.
I get a 404 so thanks for recording and attaching the page. We should not allow custom cursors to escape the content area, especially not above the "Line of Death" into the chrome toolbar area as this site does.
Firefox can't tell if a custom cursor is simply creative or if it's a "fake" (one that looks like the real cursor only offset). If the site is faking things inside their own web content that's one thing, but if that fake gets them to click (or not click) on actual browser chrome that can be a security issue.
Another problem with fake cursors is getting the user to click on permission prompts, typically these days "door hangers" that bleed over the web content area. We need to keep these custom cursors out of those areas as well (harder!). In this example the "fake" cursor is above the real pointer location; in an attempt to lure a prompt click the fake image would be below or to the side of the real (invisible) pointer location.
As used in this tech support scam example it's a "sec-low" spoof, but being able to spoof clicks onto permission prompts raises the stakes. In particular this could be used to get someone to install a malicious web extension or enable their camera and microphone.Blocks: [eviltraps](/show_bug.cgi?id=432687 "NEW - [meta] Protect users from websites that trap them or destroy their experience")Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDComponent: Untriaged → LayoutEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Really interesting that everyone but me gets a 404. Makes me think the host is doing some kind of filtering to deny access to some. Anyway, the evil website is still working fine for me right now, so attaching a .HAR file of the content just in case it's needed (captured via Firefox's Web Developer Network tool).

The way this works is that they use a cursor image that's 128x128 pixels, and shows the arrow in the top-right corner, with the actual hotspot for the cursor being somewhere else.
I'm not sure what we'd be able to do about this without breaking custom cursors entirely, besides limiting the size. I guess we could try to do more math on the layout size and remove the custom cursor if the cursor image starts overlapping the boundary of the content window? :dholbert, does that sound doable at all?Flags: needinfo?(dholbert)

Well, as noted in earlier comments, the simplest way of fixing this is to just stop using the custom cursor when it overlaps with the chrome, even if the hotspot doesn't (yet). This wouldn't really affect "benign" custom cursors. The question is who knows our custom cursor code and whether that fix is feasible - if not, perhaps we could do what you're suggesting... Looks like Neil did the e10s support and Emilio did some pointer lock work. Maybe they can help.Flags: needinfo?(enndeakin)Flags: needinfo?(emilio)

I haven't done much cursor stuff actually, but I know some of the cursor bits. So what this is doing if I understand correctly is using a big cursor so that when the pointer is over content it seems it is over the chrome, right?
So this should be an adequate test-case.

So, I think the place to fix this is around the widget code (nsIWidget::SetCursor). There we can check the bounds of the widget and the image, along with the hotspot, and just fall back to the default cursor or something.
That's slightly annoying though, since the user could be hovering something that would usually have a pointer cursor or what not, and we wouldn't be able to fall back to it... Could we maybe clip the cursor to the widget instead during painting? I don't know. Looks like dbaron and smaug also have written / reviewed a bunch of the custom cursor stuff, so they may have opinions.Flags: needinfo?(emilio)

I think clipping the cursor is not great because the majority of the cursor may actually be transparent, and clipping the non-transparent area leaves the user without any kind of feedback...

I did a bunch of refactoring in [bug 1520502](/show_bug.cgi?id=1520502 "RESOLVED FIXED - Send the default and the custom cursor in the same IPC message.") to be able to show the right cursor when intersecting the browser chrome, though I'm of course open to implementing something else :)

And for now, start blocking custom cursors that are larger than 64 pixels.

I wish I knew how to add a test for this, but I tested manually using the

test-case from [bug 1518189](/show_bug.cgi?id=1518189 "RESOLVED DUPLICATE - Large custom cursor prevents user from closing browser tab") with and without hidpi.

We always treat the cursor image size as CSS pixels (and upscale it to device

pixels in HiDPI). We have bugs to stop doing that though ([bug 1425694](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425694 "RESOLVED FIXED - [HiDPI] Custom PNG cursors are pixellated at HiDPI (with no workaround at the moment)")).

Hey Emilio, sorry I missed this. In the Blink intent-to-deprecate I was planning on blocking custom cursors >32x32, but I now see you've done this only for >64x64 cursors.

Our usage data in Chrome 74 shows ~.01% of page visits impacted by the 32x32 scoping (i.e. only those pages have the cursors go outside of the viewport boundary). What do you think about making this more strict?

I'm ambivalent, it seems ok to do that. It's a one-liner patch[1](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8ff2cd0a27e3764d9540abdc5a66b2fb1e4e9644/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.h#712).

It's not much, but at least in Chrome you can just barely get to the "x" button on a tab with 63px if the bookmark bar is hidden, and you can easily reach the extension buttons / back / forward / etc. If the limit is 32x, you can barely reach even those controls.

My slight preference is to protect more and revert to gating on >64x64 if we find compat issues.

I'm OK with erring on the side of caution and going with 32x so we have alignment. (Looks like we would based on this commit: [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0acc6c91a8bce9237aa8c3a5085945339f50e150](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/0acc6c91a8bce9237aa8c3a5085945339f50e150).)

I don't think we will want to ship Fx67 with the 64x limit and Fx68 with the 32x limit, however, so I guess we either get the change in during this week's soft freeze or do an uplift.

I disagree with that, that chromium patch only adds a deprecation message, as far as I understand, so we'd be the only ones actually blocking the cursor.

Blocking 32px cursors adds significantly more risk. I'm fine landing that change on nightly, but probably not on 67... wdyt?

Can you elaborate? I don't think there's any plan to add any more restrictions.

This issue is not 100% fixed with doorhanger notifications.

I just tried it with the latest nightly (Build ID 20190322101035): <https://i.imgur.com/4aQeyBz.mp4>

(The cursor does not really flash like in the video, that's from the recording software.)

As you can see the custom cursor goes many pixels into the doorhanger.

This is from the following malicious website (still live):

`hxxps://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rsscfr/de/index.html`

(malicious XPI here: `hxxp://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/exyyt/de.xpi`)

Can you file a separate bug for that?

That's a quite different situation, and the fix for that would be fairly different (and probably way more complicated).

Note that the content process has no idea of whether there's a door-hanger around and what's its geometry. Also, how doorhangers and fullscreen interact in that site seems unfortunate...

Note to MDN writers:

I've added a note about this to the Fx67 rel notes:

<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/67#CSS>

In terms of other work, I think it makes sense to add a note about Fx/Chrome's change to the BCD for the cursor property?

What I meant earlier about "do we plan to do something more thorough" is this: the idea of just limiting the cursor size to a specific pixel maximum feels placeholder-ish to me, for a couple of reasons:

* 32-pixel cursors are not very large; many games use larger cursors than this for various features, for example, and that feels very much like a serious restriction.
* Using a pixel count maximum is especially problematic in a HiDPI or UltraDPI setting. a 32x32 pixel cursor on an extremely high resolution device is *tiny*.
* It's just... not a very clean solution.

It seems like we could do some actual checking into the cursor image itself. Look at the cursor and look for things such as, perhaps:

* Is the hotspot on a visible pixel which is part of a group of N[1] visible pixels, or within a small number of pixels of such a group? If not, is there a grouping of at least N visible pixels in every direction from the hotspot? This will prevent the hotspot from being off in a total void.
* Along every edge of the cursor, there should be at least N pixels in a group that contacts the edge. There's no reason a cursor should have empty space on any side.
* It might even make sense to crop images so that every edge has a grouping of N pixels making contact with each edge of the image.

[1] ***N*** is a computed number of pixels that, grouped together, are reasonably easily visible to the average person given the current display resolution.

Documentation updated:

* Submitted [BCD PR 4111](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/4111) to update data for Firefox and Firefox Android (which doesn't support `cursor` at all)
* Added a paragraph to [CSS cursor property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) page that says that browsers may choose to set a size limit

That should cover it (once the PR is merged and the production site updated).

I've managed to reproduce this issue on an affected Firefox 61.0a1 (2018-03-14) using Windows 10x64 by following the STR from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1445844#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Custom cursor goes outside the bounds of the web content in \"malware\" website").

This issue is verified fixed using Firefox 67.0b19 and Firefox 68.0a1(2019-05-12) on the following OSes: Windows 10x64, mac OS 10.14, Ubuntu 18.04x64 and Windows 7x64.

The top bar of Firefox is working fine except the part with the fake cursor on the page.

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

* [Bug 1445844](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1445844)

#### [#CVE-2019-11696: Java web start .JNLP files are not recognized as executable files for download prompts](#CVE-2019-11696)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Files with the `.JNLP` extension used for "Java web start" applications are not treated as executable content for download prompts even though they can be executed if Java is installed on the local system. This could allow users to mistakenly launch an executable binary locally.

##### References

* [Bug 1392955](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392955)

#### [#CVE-2019-11697: Pressing key combinations can bypass installation prompt delays and install extensions](#CVE-2019-11697)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `ALT` and "a" keys are pressed when users receive an extension installation prompt, the extension will be installed without the install prompt delay that keeps the prompt visible in order for users to accept or decline the installation. A malicious web page could use this with spoofing on the page to trick users into installing a malicious extension.

##### References

* [Bug 1440079](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079)

#### [#CVE-2019-11698: Theft of user history data through drag and drop of hyperlinks to and from bookmarks](#CVE-2019-11698)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a crafted hyperlink is dragged and dropped to the bookmark bar or sidebar and the resulting bookmark is subsequently dragged and dropped into the web content area, an arbitrary query of a user's browser history can be run and transmitted to the content page via `drop` event data. This allows for the theft of browser history by a malicious site.
