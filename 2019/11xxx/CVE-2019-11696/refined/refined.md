Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11696:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Firefox not treating files with the `.JNLP` extension as executable content during download prompts. These `.JNLP` files, used for Java Web Start applications, can be executed if Java is installed on the local system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Executable Filetype Association:** Firefox failed to recognize `.JNLP` files as executable, unlike `.jar` files.
- **Bypass of Security Prompts:** The lack of proper recognition meant that users were not presented with the same security prompts and warnings they would receive when downloading a regular executable file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unintentional Execution:** A user could download a malicious `.JNLP` file and unknowingly execute it, potentially leading to malware infection.
- **Malware Distribution:** Malicious actors can exploit this to distribute Java applications disguised as regular downloads.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Download:** An attacker would host a malicious `.JNLP` file on a website or distribute it via other means (e.g., email).
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would then attempt to trick the user into downloading and executing the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Hosting:** The attacker needs to host a malicious `.JNLP` file on a server.
- **Social Engineering/Phishing:** The attacker needs to lure the victim into downloading the malicious JNLP file.
- **Java Runtime:** The target system needs to have a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed for the JNLP to execute.

**Additional Notes:**

- This issue was reported externally.
- The fix involved treating JNLP files as executable, prompting users with appropriate warnings on download.
- There was some discussion regarding the definition of "executable", with some arguing that JNLP files should not be treated as executables.
- The fix was initially implemented in Firefox 67 but was later backed out for ESR-68 due to usability concerns and was addressed in a subsequent bug report
- This was considered a moderate severity issue
