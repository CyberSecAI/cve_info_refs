Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11762:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from inconsistent security checks when handling cross-origin objects. Specifically, when two same-origin documents modify `document.domain` to become cross-origin, the browser fails to properly enforce same-origin restrictions when calling DOM methods with a cross-origin `this` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Same-origin policy violation: The vulnerability allows a script in one document to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on a window object from a different origin.
- Inconsistent security checks: The browser applied different security checks when accessing properties directly vs. when using `call()` or `apply()`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  The primary impact is a bypass of the intended same-origin policy, which could potentially lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information or execute arbitrary actions in the context of the victim window.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves two same-origin documents.
- The attacker needs to modify the document.domain property in at least one of the documents to intentionally create cross-origin communication.
- Once cross-origin, the attacker can use `call()` or `apply()` on a function from the attacker's document while passing the window object from the victim document as `this`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have control of two same-origin documents.
- The attacker needs to be able to modify `document.domain` within one of these documents.
- No other special position is required.

**Additional details from the Bugzilla entry:**
- This vulnerability was a regression caused by a previous fix (bug 1514050).
- The fix involved ensuring that security checks are done on the `this` value of DOM calls in the same way as property access checks.
- The performance impact of the fix was noticeable but still faster than Chrome, while slower than Safari.
- The bug was rated as "sec-moderate" and a security approval was not needed to land the fix.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Firefox 70 and ESR 68.2.
