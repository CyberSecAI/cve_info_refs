# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-33

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in - Firefox ESR 68.2

Announced
October 22, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 68.2

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

##### References

* [Bug 1584907](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584907)

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When following the value's prototype chain, it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577107)

#### [#CVE-2019-11758: Potentially exploitable crash due to 360 Total Security](#CVE-2019-11758)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla community member Philipp reported a memory safety bug present in Firefox 68 when 360 Total Security was installed. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption in the accessibility engine and we presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### References

* [Bug 1536227](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1536227)

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577953](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577953)

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1577719](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577719)

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

##### References

* [Bug 1561502](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502)

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

##### References

* [Bug 1582857](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857)

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

* [Bug 1584216](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584216)

#### [#CVE-2019-11764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2](#CVE-2019-11764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

We should be using the same security checks when we try to read a property on a cross-origin object, e.g., `crossOriginWindow.open` and when we try to call a same-origin native function with a cross-origin `this` object, e.g., `window.open.call(crossOriginWindow)`. For the most part, they do behave the same, but when the objects are same-site with a document.domain difference, the latter succeeds, while the former throws a security exception.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Security regression, sort of.

So the specific testcase here is, starting with A and B same-origin windows and then changing `document.domain` in B but not A:

```
  A.alert.call(B);

```

Per spec this should throw an exception, as follows: <https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-create-operation-function> step 2.1.2.2 calls into <https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage#integration-with-idl:perform-a-security-check> which for Window and Location objects checks `IsPlatformObjectSameOrigin` before allowing access. Similar for <https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-attribute-getter> step 1.1.2.2 and <https://heycam.github.io/webidl/#dfn-attribute-setter> step 4.5.2. We don't end up doing this check when A and B are same-compartment right now (we do do it if they are in different compartments).

This is a regression from [bug 1514050](/show_bug.cgi?id=1514050 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove wrapper recomputation on document.domain changes"), as far as I can tell.

[Performance testcase](attachment.cgi?id=9094354)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9094354&action=edit)

Patch coming up, but here are some numbers for this performance testcase, all in ns per property get:

* Firefox without patch, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 155 156 162 161 154
  + Bottom line: 17 17 18 18 18
* Firefox with patch, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 186 185 185 187 190
  + Bottom line: 19 18 17 18 18

For comparison, on the same hardware,

* Chrome, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 312 326 306 317 309
  + Bottom line: 220 221 230 238 226
* Safari, 5 runs:

  + Top line: 30 34 39 32 33
  + Bottom line: 31 31 44 32 31

The top line is accessing a DOM property on a window different from the one the script is running from; the botttom line is accessing it on the same window.

I am pretty sure that for the bottom line we end up on Ion fast-paths which bypass the extra code I am adding to deal with this bug, which is why there is no performance change there. For the top line, we do have a noticeable (20%) regression, but we're still a lot faster than Chrome and still a lot slower than Safari.

The profile for the post-patch case is at <https://perfht.ml/2V8Y22l> and shows 6.4% under `IsCrossOriginAccessibleObject`, 2.3% under `IsPlatformObjectSameOrigin`, and probably some of the 6% of time spent in `GenericGetter` is the inlined `IsCrossCompartmentWrapper` check. This is kinda sorta consistent with the observed ~20% slowdown: the new code I added should be no more than 16% of the total runtime of the testcase, just eyeballing the numbers. If someone can think of a sane faster way to do this, I'm all ears. But it seems like there are more wins to be had by moving more of this to the JIT somehow and avoiding the proxy overhead instead...

[Bug 1582857](/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857 "RESOLVED FIXED - DOM methods called with cross-origin this object don't handle document.domain consideration correctly"). Fix security checks around this-unwrapping. r=peterv

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: That is a good question.

The actual security impact here is that if two pages start out same-origin, but then set `document.domain` differently so that they are no longer same-origin, this bug allows calling arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window. You just have to grab the method/getter/setter from your own window, and `.call()` it, passing the other window as `this`.

How to actually exploit that, while not having the ability to just inject script into the other window before your `document.domain` values diverge, is an interesting question. And of course this only affects sites that use `document.domain` *and* depend on the no-longer-same-origin aspect of it somehow.

With all that out of the way, I think it's pretty clear based on the function naming that this has to do with security checks for "this" values of DOM methods, and that the objects involved are the ones that are normally accessible cross-origin. I suspect anyone competent would figure out that means Window and Location, and likely guess that this has to do with using those as `this` values for DOM calls, at which point they can pretty easily discover the problem. Whether they can then exploit it is an interesting question.

I could probably obfuscate the commit message some if I had to, but I am really not sure it buys us much given the way he code looks.

* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Yes
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: 67 and newer
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: [Bug 1514050](/show_bug.cgi?id=1514050 "RESOLVED FIXED - Remove wrapper recomputation on document.domain changes")
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: I *think* this should not cause any regressions, but a bit of shaking out would be nice, especially because this patch *does* make us throw exceptions in cases where we currently don't (though other browsers do).

In discussion with Dan, we rated this a sec-moderate so this doesn't need sec-approval+ to land.

bz, sounds like you can land this in trunk now and maybe we can aim for uplift for beta 10 if the results are good.

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 16.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=xenial)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

[CVE-2020-6798](/security/CVE-2020-6798), [CVE-2020-6800](/security/CVE-2020-6800), [CVE-2020-6805](/security/CVE-2020-6805), [CVE-2020-6806](/security/CVE-2020-6806), [CVE-2020-6807](/security/CVE-2020-6807),

[CVE-2020-6812](/security/CVE-2020-6812), [CVE-2020-6814](/security/CVE-2020-6814), [CVE-2020-6819](/security/CVE-2020-6819), [CVE-2020-6820](/security/CVE-2020-6820), [CVE-2020-6821](/security/CVE-2020-6821),

[CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 70

**Note:** We have updated this advisory on June 26, 2020 to include CVE-2020-12412 and on March 20, 2023 to include CVE-2019-25136, which were fixed in Firefox 70 but not recognized or acknowledged immediately.

#### [#CVE-2018-6156: Heap buffer overflow in FEC processing in WebRTC](#CVE-2018-6156)

Reporter
Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

Incorrect derivation of a packet length in WebRTC caused heap corruption via a crafted video file. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1480088](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1480088)

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

* [Bug 1584907](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584907)

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When storing a value in IndexedDB, the value's prototype chain is followed and it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577107](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577107)

#### [#CVE-2019-25136: Invalid styles allowed from content processes](#CVE-2019-25136)

Reporter
Emilio Cobos Álvarez
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised child process could have injected XBL Bindings into privileged CSS rules, resulting in arbitrary code execution and a sandbox escape.

##### References

* [Bug 1530709](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530709)

#### [#CVE-2020-12412: Address bar spoof using history navigation and blocked ports](#CVE-2020-12412)

Reporter
Adrian Karolak from ING Tech Poland
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By navigating a tab using the history API, an attacker could cause the address bar to display the incorrect domain (with the https:// scheme, a blocked port number such as '1', and without a lock icon) while controlling the page contents.

##### References

* [Bug 1528587](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1528587)

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1577953](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577953)

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

##### References

* [Bug 1577719](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1577719)

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

##### References

* [Bug 1561502](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502)

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

##### References

* [Bug 1582857](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1582857)

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters, enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

* [Bug 1584216](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1584216)

#### [#CVE-2019-11765: Incorrect permissions could be granted to a website](#CVE-2019-11765)

Reporter
Paul Theriault
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process that would cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission.

* [Bug 1562582](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1562582)

#### [#CVE-2019-17000: CSP bypass using object tag with data: URI](#CVE-2019-17000)

Reporter
Yangzheng Li
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An object tag with a data URI did not correctly inherit the document's Content Security Policy. This allowed a CSP bypass in a cross-origin frame if the document's policy explicitly allowed `data:` URIs.

##### References

* [Bug 1441468](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1441468)

#### [#CVE-2019-17001: CSP bypass using object tag when script-src 'none' is specified](#CVE-2019-17001)

Reporter
Matheus Vrech
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A Content-Security-Policy that blocks in-line scripts could be bypassed using an object tag to execute JavaScript in the protected document (cross-site scripting). This is a separate bypass from CVE-2019-17000.
*Note: This flaw only affected Firefox 69 and was not present in earlier versions.*

Reporter
Kevin Brosnan
Impact
low
##### Description

If `upgrade-insecure-requests` was specified in the Content Security Policy, and a link was dragged and dropped from that page, the link was not upgraded to https.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

[ObtainJSONView-testcase-new.html](attachment.cgi?id=9074096)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9074096&action=edit)

I'm attaching a testcase that shows this work. When viewing the testcase click the submit button, and then open the console window and look at testWin.JSONView

The issue here is that defense in depth against data URIs in new tabs actually leaves a small window of time in which it is possible to gain a reference to a JSONView window/tab before it is closed.

This tab just leaves the JSONView Object that has been cloned into the content scope accessible from the window reference that is held.

I was planning to do more work on this seeing as this is a great stepping stone, but my situation and time right now aren't going to allow it.

In the past I believe we treated this as sec-high so yeah.

I thought I should point out that since bugzilla and the attachments are separate you do have to confirm that you are leaving bugzilla with the testcase hosted here. Still works though.

OK, I have 3 questions for different domain experts:

1. why do we block the toplevel data URI load "too late" here, and is there any chance of doing it sooner? (Christoph)
2. this custom mimetype stuff is scary. Can we stop allowing websites to trip this? (Boris/Bobby)
3. Can we ensure the document gets a null principal and/or ensure that the content-exposed JSONView thing is only accessible from the null principal associated with that document? (unsure if this alone is sufficient here, if the document is alive and the controlling page that creates it can put/run script in it, it might not be) (Boris/Bobby)

> this custom mimetype stuff is scary. Can we stop allowing websites to trip this?

Well, we shouldn't be building the JSON viewer on top of a stream converter to a custom mimetype to start with, and make it be more like the XML viewer, but people ignored me when I told them that... That said, the real issue is the various script being injected into the global scope, which would probably still be an issue, right?

The only reason the random MIME type matters here is that unlike `application/json` it triggers the data: detection to close the window.

> Can we ensure the document gets a null principal and/or ensure that the content-exposed JSONView thing is only accessible from the null principal associated with that document?

Just to be clear, the document in question is "about:blank".

So the sequence of events here is:

1. Page opens a new window. That window contains an "about:blank", which is of course same-origin with the page that did the `window.open` call. The script on the page has a reference to this window.
2. We start loading the `data:` URL in there.
3. The `data:` blocking kicks in, blocks the load, closes the new tab.

The page still has a reference to the window in question, which contains a same-origin "about:blank", so it can touch its properties. We can't retroactively mutate the principal of the "about:blank", obviously.

It looks like `JSONView` gets injected in onStartRequest in converter-child.js. In the "normal" case (application/json), we get into this code's `onStartRequest`, call `this.listener.onStartRequest(request)`, that sets up the new window with a nullprincipal for the JSON viewer (because of the `resetPrincipalToInheritToNullPrincipal` call), and then we inject in it.

In the testcase in this bug, we call `this.listener.onStartRequest(request)`, that does NOT set up a new window, and cancels the channel instead. We ignore that, and go on to inject into the window, but of course now we're injecting into the wrong window.

So a simple fix would be to check that `request.status` is still success after that `onStartRequest` call, and if not skip all the rest of the work. In particular, this code as written is violating Necko's callback contract: it's calling `onDataAvailable` after the request has been canceled! Similar in `onStopRequest`, actually...

A more robust fix would be to do all that and also avoid injecting if the principal of `win` doesn't match `request.loadInfo.principalToInherit`, because if that's the case then we're not injecting into the right thing.

(In reply to Al Billings [:abillings] from [comment #6](/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502#c6 "VERIFIED FIXED - By using a form with a data URI it's possible to gain access to the privileged JSONView object that has been cloned into content."))

> Can someone suggest a rating here? How dangerous is this, really?

Depends how much can be done with a would-be privileged object. The APIs exposed by the JSONView object don't allow you to do much of anything anymore (they used to allow saving a file to disk, but afaict that's not a directly exposed API on the object but done using events ([bug 1297361](/show_bug.cgi?id=1297361 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer: use listeners instead of exporting postChromeMessage")), so I don't see how you'd activate it on the object once the window it belonged to has gone away).

Normally, I think wrappers are supposed to save our bacon here - but this particular object is cloned into content so content can get access, and the exploit gets access to the clone (I think), not the original object. So I'm not sure there's much left. It also doesn't look like we ever re-access the object from chrome so it's not like you could break assumptions about that later.

That said, looks like <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8a990595ce6d5ed07ace2d4d5d86cc69aec90bde/devtools/client/jsonview/converter-child.js#193-225> landed in [bug 1460840](/show_bug.cgi?id=1460840 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer's converter-child should not trust JSONView without Xrays") on 62, and I don't know if that means we're in a slightly worse place on 60-esr.

[bug 1297361](/show_bug.cgi?id=1297361 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer: use listeners instead of exporting postChromeMessage") and [bug 1333210](/show_bug.cgi?id=1333210 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer: Make even top level windows protected from content level window access.") would make me think the current incarnation would be sec-low or sec-moderate, esp. based on the discussion in [bug 1333210](/show_bug.cgi?id=1333210 "RESOLVED FIXED - JSON Viewer: Make even top level windows protected from content level window access."). But Bobby or Boris should probably confirm I'm not missing something...

So gaining access to chrome privileged objects, that fully clone into content and remain accessible(not my fault) is a sec-low/moderate now? Will wait on bz or bobby, but this is the perfect stepping stone Gijs, nothing else hanging that I could see and I assure you with time on this that low/moderate will jump to a high/critical. There's functions here that allow one to attempt the bypass of xray wrappers. Will wait and see, thinking I should have put more into this instead of cutting trees ;)

|  | |

I haven't looked at the details of this bug, but here's my take:

(1) In general, a regular content object that was created as a clone of a privileged object is not sensitive. It's just a content object after the clone.

(2) The one potential to exception to the above would be any function wrappers created with cloneFunctions/exportFunction. However, the intent is for that exposure mechanism to be treated as explicit API exposure to untrusted code, and thus privileged code doing function exports *should* be treating calls to those functions as untrusted.

(3) An exported function that is *not* safe to be called by untrusted code would qualify as a specific security issue with that function, along with any mistaken notion that calls to such a function could be reliably regulated after injecting it into the content scope.

So I don't consider content access to a cloned object to be a security issue, unless it has unsafe exported functions. That said, I'm generally in favor of paying partial bounties for concept code that motivates us to implement useful defense-in-depth improvements, even if the concept code was not a complete exploit.

> So gaining access to chrome privileged objects, that fully clone into content and remain accessible(not my fault) is a sec-low/moderate now?

The point is, the object you get access to isn't actually chrome privileged. The implementation was changed since the earlier bugs you reported on the JSON viewer.

Getting access to an object that isn't privileged but that exposes methods/data that would not normally be web-accessible would still be interesting, but AFAICT it doesn't do that either.

(edit: hm, I didn't see Bobby's comment before replying but didn't actually get asked about a mid-air by bugzilla. In any case, I agree with [comment #9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1561502#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - By using a form with a data URI it's possible to gain access to the privileged JSONView object that has been cloned into content."))

That perfectly sums up the definition of sec-moderate :-) Not so bad on its own, but the potential to be combined with other bugs, features, or maybe just additional knowledge, to make something abusable. Given some of the other discussion (this is a clone, chrome code never does anything with it after) it might even be sec-low, but I'm willing to go with sec-moderate on the premise that you might find more here.

Fair enough Dan, not trying to be difficult just venting a little. More than once I felt like calling my actual day job and just focusing here, which now I feel was right.

> 1. why do we block the toplevel data URI load "too late" here, and is there any chance of doing it sooner? (Christoph)

We tried blocking data: URI navigations earlier in the lifecycle, but we figured we have to wait for the response so we can actually decide whether to render or download, because we don't want to block things that are not rendered in the browser anyway.

To sum it up, we can not block data: URI navigations earlier, we have to wait till we hit nsDSURIContentListener::DoContent

Hey guys I know I'm lacking lately appreciate all the work here. I would almost literally kill for the stability and time to get back up to date with everything. Working toward it, who knows maybe I'll get there. Thanks again, appreciate the hard work from you guys as always. Keep it up, keeps me motivated too.

Per IRC discussion with Gijs, it's a bit late in the cycle to take this for Fx69 (we're building the RC next week), so we think it'd be best to let this fix ride with Fx70 and uplift to ESR68 during the next cycle for the 68.2esr release shipping alongside 70.

#### [#CVE-2019-15903: Heap overflow in expat library in XML\_GetCurrentLineNumber](#CVE-2019-15903)

Reporter
Sebastian Pipping
Impact
high
##### Description

In libexpat before 2.2.8, crafted XML input could fool the parser into changing from DTD parsing to document parsing too early. A subsequent call to `XML_GetCurrentLineNumber` or `XML_GetCurrentColumnNumber` then resulted in a heap-based buffer over-read.

#### [#CVE-2019-11757: Use-after-free when creating index updates in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11757)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

When following the value's prototype chain, it was possible to retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently reference it. This resulted in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11758: Potentially exploitable crash due to 360 Total Security](#CVE-2019-11758)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla community member Philipp reported a memory safety bug present in Firefox 68 when 360 Total Security was installed. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption in the accessibility engine and we presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

#### [#CVE-2019-11759: Stack buffer overflow in HKDF output](#CVE-2019-11759)

Reporter
Guido Vranken
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An attacker could have caused 4 bytes of HMAC output to be written past the end of a buffer stored on the stack. This could be used by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or more likely lead to a crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11760: Stack buffer overflow in WebRTC networking](#CVE-2019-11760)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A fixed-size stack buffer could overflow in nrappkit when doing WebRTC signaling. This resulted in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances.

#### [#CVE-2019-11761: Unintended access to a privileged JSONView object](#CVE-2019-11761)

Reporter
Cody Crews
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By using a form with a data URI it was possible to gain access to the privileged `JSONView` object that had been cloned into content. Impact from exposing this object appears to be minimal, however it was a bypass of existing defense in depth mechanisms.

#### [#CVE-2019-11762: document.domain-based origin isolation has same-origin-property violation](#CVE-2019-11762)

Reporter
Kris Maglione
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If two same-origin documents set document.domain differently to become cross-origin, it was possible for them to call arbitrary DOM methods/getters/setters on the now-cross-origin window.

#### [#CVE-2019-11763: Incorrect HTML parsing results in XSS bypass technique](#CVE-2019-11763)

Reporter
Gareth Heyes
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Failure to correctly handle null bytes when processing HTML entities resulted in Firefox incorrectly parsing these entities. This could have led to HTML comment text being treated as HTML which could have led to XSS in a web application under certain conditions. It could have also led to HTML entities being masked from filters - enabling the use of entities to mask the actual characters of interest from filters.

#### [#CVE-2019-11764: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.2](#CVE-2019-11764)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Bob Clary, Jason Kratzer, Aaron Klotz, Iain Ireland, Tyson Smith, Christian Holler, Steve Fink, Honza Bambas, Byron Campen, and Cristian Brindusan reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 69 and Firefox ESR 68.1. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
