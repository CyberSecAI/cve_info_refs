The provided content relates to CVE-2019-11340.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way Sydent (a Matrix identity server) handles email address validation in conjunction with Synapse (a Matrix homeserver). Sydent uses Python's `email.utils.parseaddr` function which silently discards the prefix of a malformed email address, such as `user@example.com@attacker.com`, without raising an error. This would result in Sydent sending a validation token to `user@example.com` but storing `user@example.com@attacker.com` as validated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Improper Input Validation:** Sydent doesn't explicitly check if the parsed email address from `email.utils.parseaddr` matches the original input.
2. **Reliance on Naive Regular Expressions:** Synapse's configuration for allowed email domains uses regular expressions that can be bypassed by malformed email addresses. The regular expressions would not identify the second domain in email addresses like `user@example.com@attacker.com`, leading to a bypass of restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could bypass email domain restrictions set in Synapse by registering with malformed email addresses. This could allow unauthorized users to register on a Matrix server that is intended to be restricted to certain domains.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the registration process of a Matrix server that uses Sydent for identity verification and has implemented email domain restrictions in its Synapse configuration.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to initiate the registration process on a Matrix homeserver that uses the vulnerable Sydent version and has configured email domain restrictions using the `allowed_local_3pids` option. They also need to be able to receive email at the address they intend to register. The attacker needs no special privileges on the server.
