The provided content describes a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Materialize CSS library. This vulnerability is due to the library's default behavior of rendering dynamic content as HTML in Toasts, Tooltips, and Autocomplete components, without proper sanitization.

**Root Cause:**

*   The library uses `jquery.html()` or `innerHTML =`  to inject user-controlled data into the DOM, which allows execution of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is that user-provided input to `M.toast`, tooltips, and autocomplete is rendered directly as HTML allowing malicious script injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when dynamic content is displayed by toasts, tooltips, or autocompletes.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can access and steal user session cookies.
*   **Data Theft:** The attacker can steal sensitive information from the user's page.
*   **Page Defacement:** The attacker can modify the content of the web page.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker can redirect users to malicious sites for malware distribution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft malicious HTML/JavaScript code and inject it as user data. Specifically the following parameters are vulnerable:
    *   `html` parameter within the `M.toast` function.
    *   The `data-tooltip` attribute for tooltips.
    *   The data provided to the autocomplete `data` option

*   **Reflected XSS:** As described in the report, this vulnerability is present when a server fails and returns javascript within the message, then the client consumes this message via the affected components.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Control Input:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript in user-controlled data that is passed to the vulnerable components (Toasts, Tooltips, or Autocomplete).
*   **No Privilege Required:** The attack is performed client-side through the user's browser.
*   **Web Browser access** :  Victims need to access the website using an affected component.

The provided report also suggested mitigation:
*   Sanitize the HTML and disallow Javascript if HTML is desired, or use `jquery.text()` instead of `jquery.html()` or `innerHTML =`.
*   Provide an option to allow unsafe data by configuration (e.g. `options : { allowUnsafeData: true }`).
