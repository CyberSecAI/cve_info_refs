Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11712:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how NPAPI plugins (like Flash) handle HTTP status 308 redirect responses. Specifically, POST requests made by these plugins can bypass Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements when redirected using a 308 status code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CORS bypass:** NPAPI plugins fail to properly enforce CORS restrictions when following 308 redirects.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** An attacker can potentially perform CSRF attacks by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   An attacker can send cross-origin POST requests bypassing CORS restrictions. This could allow an attacker to, e.g., make unauthorized modifications to a user's account.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker crafts a web page that uses an NPAPI plugin (like Flash).
*   The plugin makes a POST request to an attacker-controlled server.
*   The attacker's server responds with a 308 redirect to the target/vulnerable origin.
*   The NPAPI plugin bypasses CORS checks and sends the cross-origin POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs a web server to host the initial malicious page and respond with the 308 redirect.
*   The attacker needs a vulnerable application at a target domain.
*   The attacker must convince a user to visit a web page which contains the malicious plugin code.
*   The attacker is remote, they don't need to be authenticated nor do they need to be on the same local network.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability was identified by Gregory Smiley of Security Compass.
*   The issue affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.
*   The provided content indicates that the vulnerability is considered a 'high' impact issue.
*   The flaw is associated with how browsers manage redirects with NPAPI plugins.
