Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `form_maker_ajax` and `form_maker_ajax_frontend` functions within the Form Maker WordPress plugin. These functions dynamically load a file based on the value of the `$_GET['action']`, `$_POST['action']`, or `$_REQUEST['page']` parameters respectively, without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary weakness is the ability to include local files through directory traversal. By manipulating the `action` or `page` parameters with values like `/../../../../../index`, an attacker can force the plugin to load arbitrary files from the server's file system.
2.  **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** In the `form_maker_ajax` function, the vulnerability is exploitable via CSRF. Because the plugin uses both `$_GET['action']` and `$_POST['action']`, an attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into submitting a crafted request to load a malicious file.
3.  **Unauthenticated Access:** The `form_maker_ajax_frontend` function is accessible to unauthenticated users. This means an attacker can directly exploit the LFI vulnerability without needing a valid WordPress account or needing to use CSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially exposing configuration files, database credentials, source code, and other confidential data.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** While not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, LFI can sometimes be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE), if the attacker can find a way to include an uploaded file or a file that allows PHP execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker can create a malicious web page with a hidden form that forces a logged-in admin to make a request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Direct Request:** An unauthenticated attacker can directly send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable `form_maker_ajax_frontend` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious page or perform an action.
*   For direct exploitation of the frontend vulnerability, the attacker doesn't need any specific privileges or account, they simply need to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects both free and paid versions of the plugin.
*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) includes example HTML and `curl` commands to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is present in Form Maker plugin version 1.13.2.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2019-11590.
