The provided content is a commit diff from GitHub, which includes the fix for the vulnerability. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability was caused by improper sanitization of image names (titles) when displaying screenshots. The `title` attribute of the `<img>` tag was not properly sanitized, allowing for potential XSS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application was vulnerable to persistent XSS. This means that malicious script could be injected into the application and then executed whenever a user views the affected content.
*   **Improper Sanitization:** The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied data before rendering it within the HTML. Specifically, the image title was inserted directly into the `title` and `alt` attributes of the `<img>` tag without any encoding.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an image title.
*   When a user views the screenshot, the injected JavaScript code would execute in the user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    *   Steal cookies and session data.
    *   Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Deface the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the image title field, which is used to populate the title and alt attributes of images displayed via `screenshotPopup` function.
*   An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the image title when adding a screenshot to an event or object.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to add an image with a malicious title.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability if the relevant functionality is available for unauthenticated users. However, most likely the attacker would require to be authenticated to add/modify images or events.

**Fix:**

*   The commit introduces sanitization by escaping the image title by using `$('<div>').text(title).html()` before rendering it in the `title` and `alt` attribute. This converts special characters like `<` and `>` into their HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`), preventing the execution of injected script.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Jo√£o Lucas Melo Brasio from Elytron Security S.A.
*   The vulnerable code is located in the `app/webroot/js/misp.js` file.
*   The `screenshotPopup` function was modified to include the sanitization fix.
*   The fix includes sanitization for the image `url` as well, although it is not described as the issue in the commit message.
