- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input (`$score`) before using it in a SQL query. Specifically, the `score` parameter within the `Post:doReward` function is directly inserted into an SQL `UPDATE` statement without proper escaping or sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection. The lack of input sanitization allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the database query.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read sensitive data, modify data, or execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database. In the provided example, the attacker extracts user credentials (username and password) from the `roc_user` table.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `frontend\Post:doReward` endpoint with a malicious `score` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a registered user with a score greater than 1, and needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
