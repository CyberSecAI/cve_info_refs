Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11476:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an integer overflow in the `parse_report` function within the `whoopsie` service. Specifically, the `value_pos` variable, which is of type `int`, is used to store the size of the crash file being processed. Since the file size can exceed `INT_MAX`, an integer overflow occurs, leading to a negative value for `value_pos`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core weakness is the use of a signed integer (`int`) to represent the size of a file, which can be larger than the maximum value that an `int` can hold.
*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The integer overflow leads to `value_pos` having a negative value, resulting in an out-of-bounds write operation later in the code, specifically on line 440 of `whoopsie.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Read:** In combination with another vulnerability (issue 1830858), this integer overflow can allow a local attacker to read arbitrary files on the system. The provided information states that the vulnerability may *enable* arbitrary file read if combined with another vulnerability.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The provided PoC leads to whoopsie crashing repeatedly, which constitutes a denial of service, as the service continually restarts and crashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is exploited locally by creating a large crash file and an upload trigger file within the `/var/crash` directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
*   They need to be able to create files in `/var/crash`, which likely requires some local privileges.
*   The attacker needs the ability to run a proof of concept.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by Kevin Backhouse from the Semmle Security Research Team.
*   The issue was fixed by changing the type used for length calculations to prevent integer overflows.
*   The bug report on Launchpad indicates that the vulnerability was fixed in `whoopsie` versions `0.2.52.5ubuntu0.1` (xenial-security) and `0.2.62ubuntu1` (cosmic-security).
*   The disclosure date for this vulnerability was coordinated with the disclosure of issue 1830858, as both vulnerabilities could be combined for a larger impact.
*   The patch specifically avoids the use of signed integer types for lengths to ensure large crash dumps do not cause signed integer overflow.
