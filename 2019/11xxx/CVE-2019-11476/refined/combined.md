### Bug Description

Dear Ubuntu Security Team,

I would like to report an integer overflow vulnerability in whoopsie. In combination with issue 1830858, this vulnerability may enable an local attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.

I have attached a proof-of-concept which triggers the vulnerability. I have tested it on an up-to-date Ubuntu 18.04. Run it as follows:

bunzip2 PoC.tar.bz2

tar -xf PoC.tar

cd PoC

make

./killwhoopsie1

The PoC works by creating a file named `/var/crash/killwhoopsie.crash`, just over 4GB in size. It then creates a file named `/var/crash/killwhoopsie.upload`, which prompts whoopsie to start processing the .crash file. Be aware that whoopsie will keep restarting and crash repeatedly until you remove the files from /var/crash.

This is the source location of the integer overflow bug:

<http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~daisy-pluckers/whoopsie/trunk/view/698/src/whoopsie.c#L425>

The problem is that the type of value\_pos is int, but the size of the file can be larger than INT\_MAX. My PoC arranges things such that value\_pos == -16, leading to an out-of-bounds write on line 440.

Please let me know when you have fixed the vulnerability, so that I can coordinate my disclosure with yours. For reference, here is a link to Semmle's vulnerability disclosure policy: <https://lgtm.com/security#disclosure_policy>

Thank you,

Kevin Backhouse

Kevin, do you have a preferred disclosure date / time for this? I notice your policy says 90 days after initial report or 30 days after patch availability - I will be working on a patch for this issue and hope to have something together in the next week or so - and so would prefer a CRD in about 3-4 weeks time. How would 9th July suit you?

Hi Alex,

Yes, 9th July sounds good. I think it makes sense to disclose this issue on

the same day as issue 1830858.

Thanks,

Kev
