Based on the provided content, the vulnerability lies within the `LikeCondition` and `NotLikeCondition` classes of the `torpedoquery` library. Specifically, the issue was related to how the LIKE operator was being handled, where the value was not being parameterized correctly.

Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is that the `LikeCondition` and `NotLikeCondition` classes were directly embedding the user-provided string into the query instead of using a parameterized query. This was problematic when the user's input contained characters that were interpreted as SQL wildcards (e.g., %, _, etc.)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the risk of SQL injection. By crafting a malicious input string containing SQL wildcards, an attacker could potentially alter the query's logic, leading to data leaks or manipulation.
*   **Improper Parameterization**: The code was not correctly using parameterized queries, which are designed to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized data access.
*   An attacker could potentially modify data in the database.
*   An attacker could potentially disrupt the application's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the input string provided to the `like()` or `notLike()` methods of the `torpedoquery` library. Any user input that eventually gets passed to these functions without proper sanitization or parameterization could become an attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to influence the input data that is used in `like()` or `notLike()` operations.
*   The attacker doesn't need to be directly on the server. This vulnerability could be exploited through any client-side application that uses this library.

**Additional Details from the Commit Diff:**

The commit `3c20b874fba9cc2a78b9ace10208de1602b56c3f` shows the changes that fixed this vulnerability. The main changes include:

*   The `LikeCondition` and `NotLikeCondition` classes were modified to use parameterized queries. Instead of directly embedding the `toMatch` string into the query, a placeholder (`:parameter`) is now used, and the value is passed as a query parameter.
*   The `ConditionBuilder` was updated to correctly create these parameterised conditions.
*   The test cases in `StringFunctionsTest.java`, `ValueOnGoingConditionTest.java`, and `WhereClauseTest.java` were updated to reflect and test the changes, particularly with asserting the use of parameters.

In summary, the vulnerability is a classic case of SQL injection due to the improper handling of user-provided strings in LIKE/NOT LIKE clauses. The fix involves the use of parameterized queries.
