## Analysis of CVE-2019-11714

Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11714:

**Official CVE Description:**

> Necko can access a child on the wrong thread during UDP connections, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash in some instances. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 68.

**Analysis of provided content:**

The provided content consists of multiple sources, including SUSE security pages, a Mozilla bug report, and openSUSE mailing list archives. These sources provide detailed information about CVE-2019-11714 and related vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A race condition in Necko's handling of UDP connections. `PNeckoChild::SendPUDPSocketConstructor` is called off the main thread. The issue occurs because `NeckoChild` can access a child on the wrong thread during UDP connections, which causes a use-after-free.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Thread safety issue:** `NeckoChild` is accessed from threads other than the main thread without proper synchronization. This can lead to race conditions and use-after-free issues.
- **Incorrect assumptions:** The code assumes `NS_IsMainThread()` is always true in `dom/ipc/PermissionMessageUtils.cpp`.
- **Lack of proper handling for asynchronous calls:**  The `AsyncOpenURI` operation may complete and release resources before subsequent operations that depend on those resources are executed in the context of RecvPushPromise.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application crash:** The vulnerability can lead to a potentially exploitable crash due to a use-after-free condition.
- **Arbitrary code execution (potential):** While not explicitly proven, the potential for memory corruption is present.  Successful exploitation of the memory corruption could possibly allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** A malicious actor can send data that triggers a UDP connection, resulting in the vulnerability if the main thread calls into it.
- **Local:** There is also a mention in the bug report of a predictable pattern for locally saved file names in an android app, but it is in relation to another vulnerability. The context is that a malicious HTML attachment is sent to the user, who then opens it in firefox, and it can access other files due to the predictable file name scheme.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network access:** An attacker needs the ability to send network packets that can create a vulnerable UDP connection or push promises.
- **Knowledge of the vulnerability**: The attacker needs specific knowledge on how to trigger the race condition in `PNeckoChild`.
- **User interaction (required for XSS vector):** For the XSS vulnerability noted in one of the mailing lists that include this vulnerability along with others, the user must open the malicious HTML file.

**Additional Details (from the provided documents):**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by a push promise, which implies that a malicious server is capable of triggering this issue.
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure the object still exists by changing a raw pointer to a weak pointer.
- The code comments indicated that the call to `AsyncOpenURI` can be called off the main thread and that the state of the cache after the call could change the validity of pointers used afterwards.

**Related CVEs**
- Several sources include other CVEs, such as CVE-2019-11709, CVE-2019-11710, CVE-2019-11711, CVE-2019-11712, CVE-2019-11713, CVE-2019-11715, CVE-2019-11716, CVE-2019-11717, CVE-2019-11719, CVE-2019-11720, CVE-2019-11721, CVE-2019-11723, CVE-2019-11724, CVE-2019-11725, CVE-2019-11727, CVE-2019-11728, CVE-2019-11729, CVE-2019-11730, CVE-2019-11739, CVE-2019-11740, CVE-2019-11742, CVE-2019-11743, CVE-2019-11744, CVE-2019-11746, CVE-2019-11752, and CVE-2019-11755.

## Summary
The provided content confirms that the vulnerability relates to CVE-2019-11714 and offers deeper insights beyond the official CVE description. It highlights that the race condition within the  `NeckoChild` object can lead to exploitable crashes within the application.

```text
ROOT CAUSE OF VULNERABILITY: Race condition in Necko's handling of UDP connections.
WEAKNESSES/VULNERABILITIES PRESENT: Thread safety issue, incorrect assumptions about thread context and lacking proper handling for asynchronous calls.
IMPACT OF EXPLOITATION:  Application crash, potential arbitrary code execution.
ATTACK VECTORS: Network, local (via XSS vulnerability combined with predictable local file name scheme in an android app).
REQUIRED ATTACKER CAPABILITIES/POSITION: Network access to create vulnerable connections, knowledge to exploit the memory corruption. For XSS, user interaction is required.
