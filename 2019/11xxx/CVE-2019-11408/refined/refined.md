Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-11408:

*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Location:** FusionPBX's operator panel module, specifically in the `index_inc.php` file.
*   **Root Cause:** The `caller id number` string is not properly output encoded before being rendered in HTML. The output of `index_inc.php` is used by `index.php`, which refreshes periodically via an AJAX call.
*   **Weakness:** Lack of sanitization or HTML encoding of the caller ID number. The `get_call_activity()` function retrieves call activity values from FreeSWITCH via an event socket API call and extracts the caller ID number without sanitization. This unsanitized value is then directly concatenated into the HTML in `index_inc.php`.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects an XSS payload into the caller ID number field of an inbound call, which can originate from the PSTN.
*   **Impact:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the operator panel.
    *   This can lead to remote code execution when chained with CVE-2019-11409.
    *   An unauthenticated attacker can gain remote code execution, resulting in full system compromise, if an operator is viewing the vulnerable screen when the malicious call is received.
*   **Attacker Capability:** The attacker can initiate a call from outside the network with a specially crafted caller ID number. They must also know that an operator is viewing the operator panel at the time of the call.

The blog post from GDS Security provides more details than the original CVE description. It clarifies the vulnerable file and code snippets, the lack of sanitization, and the potential for chaining with CVE-2019-11409 for unauthenticated RCE. The Github commit shows the fix was to escape the `$call_name` and `$call_number` variables.
