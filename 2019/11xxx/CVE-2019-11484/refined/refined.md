  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Integer overflow when handling large bson objects.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Integer overflow due to using 'int' instead of 'size_t' for size calculations.",
     "Lack of sufficient checks to ensure bson objects are not bigger than INT_MAX."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker could cause a denial of service, expose sensitive information or execute code as the whoopsie user.",
  "Attack vectors": "Processing a specially crafted, very large crash report.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker."
