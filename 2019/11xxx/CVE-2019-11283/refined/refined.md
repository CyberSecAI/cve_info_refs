Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-11283:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the SMB Volume component of Cloud Foundry accidentally outputting sensitive information to logs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive data exposure: The username and password used for creating SMB volumes are written into the logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote user with access to the SMB Volume logs can discover the username and password.
- This would allow the attacker to gain control of the SMB volume.

**Attack vectors:**
- Access to the SMB volume logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to have access to the SMB Volume logs. This implies the attacker has some level of access to the system, but not necessarily the cloud foundry instance itself.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- CF Deployment: All versions prior to v12.2.0
- SMB Volume: All versions prior to v2.0.3
