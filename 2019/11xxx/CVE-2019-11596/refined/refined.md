      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an off-by-one error in the token count when handling 'lru mode' and 'lru temp_ttl' commands, leading to a null pointer dereference in the `process_lru_command` function.",
        "weaknesses": "The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference due to an incorrect token count in the command parsing logic.",

       "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The root cause is an off-by-one error in the token count within the `process_lru_command` function of memcached. This function parses commands, and specifically for lru mode and temp_ttl subcommands, it expects a certain number of tokens. If the number of tokens provided in the received command is not what's expected, specifically less than 4, a null pointer dereference occurs.",
         "weaknesses": "The vulnerability is a null pointer dereference resulting from an incorrect check of the number of command tokens. This occurs due to an off-by-one error where the code accesses an array element that doesn't exist, resulting in an attempt to access a null pointer.",
        "impact": "The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service (DoS). A specially crafted command can be sent to the memcached server, causing it to crash due to a null pointer dereference. This would disrupt the service and may impact any application relying on the cache.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote. A crafted 'lru' command is sent to the memcached server over the network using a client. The crafted command must include the  `mode` or `temp_ttl` subcommands but not have the expected number of tokens. An example provided is: `echo -n \"bHJ1IG1vZGUKb7G0AGxydWRl6gdtTk9UXw==\" | base64 -d | nc 127.0.0.1 11211`",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have the capability to send network packets to the memcached server. No special privileges are needed, but a network connection to the memcached server is required for the attack to be successful."
