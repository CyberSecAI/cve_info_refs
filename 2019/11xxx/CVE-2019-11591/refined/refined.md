Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11591:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way the "Contact Form by WD" WordPress plugin handles AJAX actions. The plugin uses the `form_maker_ajax_fmc` function to dynamically load files based on the `$_GET['action']` or `$_POST['action']` parameters.  Specifically, the plugin prioritizes `$_GET['action']` over `$_POST['action']` and fails to sanitize the `$_GET['action']` parameter. This allows an attacker to control the file path loaded by `form_maker_ajax_fmc`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** By manipulating the `$_GET['action']` parameter with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../`), an attacker can force the plugin to load arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The vulnerability can be exploited via a CSRF attack because the plugin doesn't properly validate the origin of the AJAX requests.  An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form to submit a request that triggers the LFI.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Disclosure:**  An attacker can read sensitive files on the server. Depending on the server configuration this could lead to sensitive data exposure, including source code, configuration files, and potentially database credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector involves crafting a URL with a malicious value in the `action` parameter.
*   **CSRF Attack:** The attack is performed by tricking a logged-in administrator into visiting a malicious webpage or executing a crafted request, which then causes the victim's browser to send a malicious request to the vulnerable site.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated. The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.
*   The attacker needs the ability to host a malicious page or send a malicious request that will be executed in a victim's browser.
*   The attacker must know the location of the vulnerable `admin-ajax.php` endpoint of the target WordPress installation.

**Additional Information:**

*   The exploit affects both free and paid versions of the plugin.
*   The Proof-of-Concept (PoC) code provided demonstrates how to create an HTML form that triggers the vulnerability.
