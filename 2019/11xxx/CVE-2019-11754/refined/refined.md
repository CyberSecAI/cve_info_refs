Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11754:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was caused by a regression that resulted in the pointer lock warning not being displayed when a website utilizes the `requestPointerLock()` function to take control of the mouse pointer. This means that when a website requests to lock the user's pointer, the expected user interface warning did not appear.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing user notification: The primary vulnerability is the lack of user notification when a website enables pointer lock. This makes it possible for a malicious website to silently take control of the userâ€™s mouse pointer.
- Regression: The root cause was a regression introduced by a previous change (bug 1533948) which broke the expected behaviour of the pointer lock warning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Hijacked mouse pointer: A malicious website could take control of the user's mouse pointer without any user notification which could confuse or trick users.
- Potential for user confusion: The lack of warning could lead users to be confused as to why their mouse pointer has disappeared or is behaving unexpectedly.
- Increased risk of user deception: This could be exploited by attackers to trick users, potentially leading to phishing or other harmful activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious website: The primary attack vector is a malicious website that uses the `requestPointerLock()` API.
- User interaction: The user would need to visit the malicious website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to host a website with malicious JavaScript code that uses the `requestPointerLock()` API to control the mouse pointer.
- The attacker needs to trick a user to visit the malicious website.

**Additional details:**
- The bug was classified as a "defect" with a "critical" severity.
- The fix involved correcting incorrect pointer lock message names.
- The fix was released in Firefox 69.0.1 and also backported to Firefox 70 and 71.
- The bug was introduced by bug 1533948 and caused regressions in the test suite (bug 1580961)
- The root cause was determined to be a coding error.
