Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-11363:

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: Inadequate input validation within the Snare Central user interface, specifically related to how user and group data was handled. This allowed manipulation of SQL queries used to resolve pre-stored user/group information.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **SQL Injection**:  The primary vulnerability was related to SQL injection. The application used an incorrect sanitization module ("small text" instead of "small string") which was insufficient to prevent SQL injection when resolving user/group data
    *   **Inadequate Input Validation:** This is a broader issue as the core cause was a failure to adequately validate and sanitize user input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An authenticated administrator-level user could manipulate SQL queries.
    *   This could potentially lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or other malicious actions related to user/group data within the application's database.
*   **Attack Vectors**:
    *   The vulnerability was accessible through the user interface of the Snare Central application.
    *   An authenticated administrator could craft specific input to alter the behavior of SQL queries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needed to have administrator-level access to the Snare Central application's user interface.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The document mentions that the CVSSv3 scores for this issue are comparatively low due to the requirement for administrator-level access and the fact that an administrator already has root-level access to the system.
*   The fix involved linking the "small text" and "small string" sanitization modules as synonyms, as well as adding generic protections to the sanitization component.
* The document also mentions a separate but similar issue, CVE-2019-11364, related to inadequate input validation in the Disk Manager component that allowed for root-level command execution. This highlights a broader pattern of input validation issues within the Snare Central application.
