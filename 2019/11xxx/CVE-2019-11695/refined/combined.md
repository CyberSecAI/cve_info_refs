##### Description

If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads.
*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11695: Custom cursor can render over user interface outside of web content](#CVE-2019-11695)

Reporter
bignis
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the addressbar to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the primary web content area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users into clicking on permission prompts, doorhanger notifications, or other buttons inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the user interface.

* [Bug 1445844](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1445844)

#### [#CVE-2019-11696: Java web start .JNLP files are not recognized as executable files for download prompts](#CVE-2019-11696)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Files with the `.JNLP` extension used for "Java web start" applications are not treated as executable content for download prompts even though they can be executed if Java is installed on the local system. This could allow users to mistakenly launch an executable binary locally.

##### References

* [Bug 1392955](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392955)

#### [#CVE-2019-11697: Pressing key combinations can bypass installation prompt delays and install extensions](#CVE-2019-11697)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `ALT` and "a" keys are pressed when users receive an extension installation prompt, the extension will be installed without the install prompt delay that keeps the prompt visible in order for users to accept or decline the installation. A malicious web page could use this with spoofing on the page to trick users into installing a malicious extension.

* [Bug 1440079](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079)

#### [#CVE-2019-11698: Theft of user history data through drag and drop of hyperlinks to and from bookmarks](#CVE-2019-11698)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a crafted hyperlink is dragged and dropped to the bookmark bar or sidebar and the resulting bookmark is subsequently dragged and dropped into the web content area, an arbitrary query of a user's browser history can be run and transmitted to the content page via `drop` event data. This allows for the theft of browser history by a malicious site.

#### [#CVE-2019-11701: webcal: protocol default handler loads vulnerable web page](#CVE-2019-11701)

Reporter
Peter af Geijerstam
Impact
low
##### Description

|  | |

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0
Build ID: 20180206200532
Steps to reproduce:
1) Navigate to <https://twomastersmedia.com/iops/?c5aa9d589430490ftfn1d5aa9d58943083=(888)%20498-4480># (note this is a website that tries to capture all events, so it's hard to get out of it)
2) Move the cursor around in the area with the red background
3) Move the cursor to the Firefox's top bar buttons (Home button / Hamburger Menu, etc) or Address bar. Click the mouse.
Special note: keep slowly moving the mouse cursor upward toward the top of the screen, it will "go off the top" and then appear again slightly below the top bar. That's the "real cursor" and all clicks are registered by that.
Actual results:
Nothing happens, it appears the click is not registered. Note that if you click and drag downward a bit, it highlights some text on the webpage itself!
Expected results:
The click should have been received by Firefox.
Note: it appears to be caused by a fake cursor - shouldn't Firefox prevent that somehow?

In my opinion the behaviour is the malware site's fault and as far as I know Firefox has no special mechanism in place for this.
My advice would be to avoid entering malware sites.
Given the above, I'll close the issue es Invalid.Status: UNCONFIRMED → RESOLVEDClosed: 7 years agoResolution: --- → INVALID

David, just to make sure I've expressed my view of the problem clearly - do we expect Firefox to allow a custom cursor to be drawn over-top of the Address Bar in Firefox? Seems like a bad thing to me that the browser should disallow as it is being used by an evil website.
Yeah, obviously avoiding the website is a good thing to do. The reason I filed this bug is because I believe it indicates a problem with the browser that this evil website is exploiting.

This site is not blocked by SafeBrowsing. If we think it's a malicious site we should report it so it gets blocked.
I get a 404 so thanks for recording and attaching the page. We should not allow custom cursors to escape the content area, especially not above the "Line of Death" into the chrome toolbar area as this site does.
Firefox can't tell if a custom cursor is simply creative or if it's a "fake" (one that looks like the real cursor only offset). If the site is faking things inside their own web content that's one thing, but if that fake gets them to click (or not click) on actual browser chrome that can be a security issue.
Another problem with fake cursors is getting the user to click on permission prompts, typically these days "door hangers" that bleed over the web content area. We need to keep these custom cursors out of those areas as well (harder!). In this example the "fake" cursor is above the real pointer location; in an attempt to lure a prompt click the fake image would be below or to the side of the real (invisible) pointer location.
As used in this tech support scam example it's a "sec-low" spoof, but being able to spoof clicks onto permission prompts raises the stakes. In particular this could be used to get someone to install a malicious web extension or enable their camera and microphone.Blocks: [eviltraps](/show_bug.cgi?id=432687 "NEW - [meta] Protect users from websites that trap them or destroy their experience")Status: RESOLVED → REOPENEDComponent: Untriaged → LayoutEver confirmed: trueFlags: needinfo?(dveditz)Keywords: [csectype-spoof](/buglist.cgi?keywords=csectype-spoof&resolution=---),

Really interesting that everyone but me gets a 404. Makes me think the host is doing some kind of filtering to deny access to some. Anyway, the evil website is still working fine for me right now, so attaching a .HAR file of the content just in case it's needed (captured via Firefox's Web Developer Network tool).

The way this works is that they use a cursor image that's 128x128 pixels, and shows the arrow in the top-right corner, with the actual hotspot for the cursor being somewhere else.
I'm not sure what we'd be able to do about this without breaking custom cursors entirely, besides limiting the size. I guess we could try to do more math on the layout size and remove the custom cursor if the cursor image starts overlapping the boundary of the content window? :dholbert, does that sound doable at all?Flags: needinfo?(dholbert)

Well, as noted in earlier comments, the simplest way of fixing this is to just stop using the custom cursor when it overlaps with the chrome, even if the hotspot doesn't (yet). This wouldn't really affect "benign" custom cursors. The question is who knows our custom cursor code and whether that fix is feasible - if not, perhaps we could do what you're suggesting... Looks like Neil did the e10s support and Emilio did some pointer lock work. Maybe they can help.Flags: needinfo?(enndeakin)Flags: needinfo?(emilio)

I haven't done much cursor stuff actually, but I know some of the cursor bits. So what this is doing if I understand correctly is using a big cursor so that when the pointer is over content it seems it is over the chrome, right?
So this should be an adequate test-case.

So, I think the place to fix this is around the widget code (nsIWidget::SetCursor). There we can check the bounds of the widget and the image, along with the hotspot, and just fall back to the default cursor or something.
That's slightly annoying though, since the user could be hovering something that would usually have a pointer cursor or what not, and we wouldn't be able to fall back to it... Could we maybe clip the cursor to the widget instead during painting? I don't know. Looks like dbaron and smaug also have written / reviewed a bunch of the custom cursor stuff, so they may have opinions.Flags: needinfo?(emilio)

I think clipping the cursor is not great because the majority of the cursor may actually be transparent, and clipping the non-transparent area leaves the user without any kind of feedback...

I did a bunch of refactoring in [bug 1520502](/show_bug.cgi?id=1520502 "RESOLVED FIXED - Send the default and the custom cursor in the same IPC message.") to be able to show the right cursor when intersecting the browser chrome, though I'm of course open to implementing something else :)

We always treat the cursor image size as CSS pixels (and upscale it to device

pixels in HiDPI). We have bugs to stop doing that though ([bug 1425694](/show_bug.cgi?id=1425694 "RESOLVED FIXED - [HiDPI] Custom PNG cursors are pixellated at HiDPI (with no workaround at the moment)")).

Hey Emilio, sorry I missed this. In the Blink intent-to-deprecate I was planning on blocking custom cursors >32x32, but I now see you've done this only for >64x64 cursors.

Our usage data in Chrome 74 shows ~.01% of page visits impacted by the 32x32 scoping (i.e. only those pages have the cursors go outside of the viewport boundary). What do you think about making this more strict?

I'm ambivalent, it seems ok to do that. It's a one-liner patch[1](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/8ff2cd0a27e3764d9540abdc5a66b2fb1e4e9644/modules/libpref/init/StaticPrefList.h#712).

I'm curious which kind of attacks can you do with cursors smaller than 64px though...

It's not much, but at least in Chrome you can just barely get to the "x" button on a tab with 63px if the bookmark bar is hidden, and you can easily reach the extension buttons / back / forward / etc. If the limit is 32x, you can barely reach even those controls.

My slight preference is to protect more and revert to gating on >64x64 if we find compat issues.

I'm OK with erring on the side of caution and going with 32x so we have alignment. (Looks like we would based on this commit: [https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/0acc6c91a8bce9237aa8c3a5085945339f50e150](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/0acc6c91a8bce9237aa8c3a5085945339f50e150).)

I don't think we will want to ship Fx67 with the 64x limit and Fx68 with the 32x limit, however, so I guess we either get the change in during this week's soft freeze or do an uplift.

I disagree with that, that chromium patch only adds a deprecation message, as far as I understand, so we'd be the only ones actually blocking the cursor.

Blocking 32px cursors adds significantly more risk. I'm fine landing that change on nightly, but probably not on 67... wdyt?

This issue is not 100% fixed with doorhanger notifications.

I just tried it with the latest nightly (Build ID 20190322101035): <https://i.imgur.com/4aQeyBz.mp4>

(The cursor does not really flash like in the video, that's from the recording software.)

As you can see the custom cursor goes many pixels into the doorhanger.

This is from the following malicious website (still live):

`hxxps://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/rsscfr/de/index.html`

Can you file a separate bug for that?

That's a quite different situation, and the fix for that would be fairly different (and probably way more complicated).

Note that the content process has no idea of whether there's a door-hanger around and what's its geometry. Also, how doorhangers and fullscreen interact in that site seems unfortunate...

I've added a note about this to the Fx67 rel notes:

In terms of other work, I think it makes sense to add a note about Fx/Chrome's change to the BCD for the cursor property?

What I meant earlier about "do we plan to do something more thorough" is this: the idea of just limiting the cursor size to a specific pixel maximum feels placeholder-ish to me, for a couple of reasons:

* 32-pixel cursors are not very large; many games use larger cursors than this for various features, for example, and that feels very much like a serious restriction.
* Using a pixel count maximum is especially problematic in a HiDPI or UltraDPI setting. a 32x32 pixel cursor on an extremely high resolution device is *tiny*.
* It's just... not a very clean solution.

It seems like we could do some actual checking into the cursor image itself. Look at the cursor and look for things such as, perhaps:

* Is the hotspot on a visible pixel which is part of a group of N[1] visible pixels, or within a small number of pixels of such a group? If not, is there a grouping of at least N visible pixels in every direction from the hotspot? This will prevent the hotspot from being off in a total void.
* Along every edge of the cursor, there should be at least N pixels in a group that contacts the edge. There's no reason a cursor should have empty space on any side.
* It might even make sense to crop images so that every edge has a grouping of N pixels making contact with each edge of the image.

[1] ***N*** is a computed number of pixels that, grouped together, are reasonably easily visible to the average person given the current display resolution.

Documentation updated:

* Submitted [BCD PR 4111](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/pull/4111) to update data for Firefox and Firefox Android (which doesn't support `cursor` at all)
* Added a paragraph to [CSS cursor property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor) page that says that browsers may choose to set a size limit

That should cover it (once the PR is merged and the production site updated).

I've managed to reproduce this issue on an affected Firefox 61.0a1 (2018-03-14) using Windows 10x64 by following the STR from [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1445844#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Custom cursor goes outside the bounds of the web content in \"malware\" website").

This issue is verified fixed using Firefox 67.0b19 and Firefox 68.0a1(2019-05-12) on the following OSes: Windows 10x64, mac OS 10.14, Ubuntu 18.04x64 and Windows 7x64.

The top bar of Firefox is working fine except the part with the fake cursor on the page.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.

This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |

# Firefox sandbox information disclosure

## Summary

The `crosscall` `FilesystemDispatcher::NtOpenFile` can leak an uninitialized handle value to a renderer due to an incorrect return value in `FileSystemPolicy::OpenFileAction`. The crosscall `NtOpenKey` seems to also suffer from the exact same bug.

In this write-up, we show how to leak a function pointer stored in the broker's stack (corresponding, in this case, to a return address).

We'll first have a glance at a `crosscall` implementation, from the renderer to the broker.

Then, we'll explain where the bug lies before eventually explaining how to trigger the bug and find a way to disclose a function pointer.

[TOC]

## Affected versions

The bug is specific to the `Windows` implementation of the sandbox.

Both `x86` and `x64` builds are affected.

## About sandboxing

On Windows, browsers usually have a sandbox where there is one main normally privileged process and several processes running at a lower privilege level. The basic idea is that every tab would execute in a restricted environment so that compromising this process would not give an attacker a complete access to its target's machine. He would need to also evade the sandbox.

To implement that, browsers make use of different mechanisms provided by the operating system such as restricted tokens, low integrity levels, job objects or station/desktop isolation.

In order to be able to do operations, a renderer process will likely have to ask the broker to do it for him using an IPC mechanism.

When trying to do system calls, a renderer might instead do what is called a `crosscall`. This means that instead of directly making a system call, a renderer will send a message asking the broker to do it for him. Depending on the policy, the broker may or may not execute the system call and send the result back to the renderer, through IPC.

## About `crosscalls`

When setting up the sandbox, renderer-side functions in ntdll like `ntdll!NtCreateFile` are hooked so as to redirect execution to the interception functions implementing the crosscall. Those functions write data in memory and signal the broker to make a crosscall.

Then, the broker executes dispatcher functions that does the actual syscall and sends the result back to the renderer through shared memory.

## Renderer-side interception of `NtCreateFile`

If we take the case of `ntdll!NtCreateFile`, the renderer will actually end up executing `TargetNtCreateFile`. What is does is the following :

1. Call the original syscall
2. If the resulting `NTSTATUS` code is either `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED` or `STATUS_NETWORK_OPEN_RESTRICTION`
   1. Validate parameters
   2. Prepare shared memory
   3. Send a signal to actually make the crosscall using the function `CrossCall`

## Broker-side dispatcher of `NtCreateFile`

After the renderer called `CrossCall` so as to make an `NtCreateFile` crosscall, the broker is going to execute the function `FilesystemDispatcher::NtCreateFile`.

After a few checks and evaluating the low level policy, it will eventually call the `FileSystemPolicy::CreateFileAction`. This is where the actual syscall will be made.

### `FilesystemDispatcher::NtCreateFile`

```
// source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/filesystem_dispatcher.cc
bool FilesystemDispatcher::NtCreateFile(IPCInfo* ipc,
                                        base::string16* name,
                                        uint32_t attributes,
                                        uint32_t desired_access,
                                        uint32_t file_attributes,
                                        uint32_t share_access,
                                        uint32_t create_disposition,
                                        uint32_t create_options) {
  if (!PreProcessName(name)) {
    // The path requested might contain a reparse point.
    ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;
  }

  const wchar_t* filename = name->c_str();

  uint32_t broker = TRUE;
  CountedParameterSet<OpenFile> params;
  params[OpenFile::NAME] = ParamPickerMake(filename);
  params[OpenFile::ACCESS] = ParamPickerMake(desired_access);
  params[OpenFile::DISPOSITION] = ParamPickerMake(create_disposition);
  params[OpenFile::OPTIONS] = ParamPickerMake(create_options);
  params[OpenFile::BROKER] = ParamPickerMake(broker);

  // To evaluate the policy we need to call back to the policy object. We
  // are just middlemen in the operation since is the FileSystemPolicy which
  // knows what to do.
  EvalResult result = policy_base_->EvalPolicy(IPC_NTCREATEFILE_TAG,
                                               params.GetBase());

  // If the policies forbid access (any result other than ASK_BROKER),
  // then check for user-granted access to file.
  if (ASK_BROKER != result &&
      mozilla::sandboxing::PermissionsService::GetInstance()->
        UserGrantedFileAccess(ipc->client_info->process_id, filename,
                              desired_access, create_disposition)) {
    result = ASK_BROKER;
  }

  HANDLE handle;
  ULONG_PTR io_information = 0;
  NTSTATUS nt_status;
  if (!FileSystemPolicy::CreateFileAction(result, *ipc->client_info, *name,
                                          attributes, desired_access,
                                          file_attributes, share_access,
                                          create_disposition, create_options,
                                          &handle, &nt_status,
                                          &io_information)) {
    ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;
  }
  // Return operation status on the IPC.
  ipc->return_info.extended[0].ulong_ptr = io_information;
  ipc->return_info.nt_status = nt_status;
  ipc->return_info.handle = handle;
  return true;
}

```
### `FileSystemPolicy::CreateFileAction`

Here, `NtCreateFileInTarget` will do the actual system call.

```
// source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/filesystem_policy.cc
bool FileSystemPolicy::CreateFileAction(EvalResult eval_result,
                                        const ClientInfo& client_info,
                                        const base::string16& file,
                                        uint32_t attributes,
                                        uint32_t desired_access,
                                        uint32_t file_attributes,
                                        uint32_t share_access,
                                        uint32_t create_disposition,
                                        uint32_t create_options,
                                        HANDLE* handle,
                                        NTSTATUS* nt_status,
                                        ULONG_PTR* io_information) {
  // The only action supported is ASK_BROKER which means create the requested
  // file as specified.
  if (ASK_BROKER != eval_result) {
    *nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return false;
  }
  IO_STATUS_BLOCK io_block = {};
  UNICODE_STRING uni_name = {};
  OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES obj_attributes = {};
  SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE security_qos = GetAnonymousQOS();

  InitObjectAttribs(file, attributes, NULL, &obj_attributes,
                    &uni_name, IsPipe(file) ? &security_qos : NULL);
  *nt_status = NtCreateFileInTarget(handle, desired_access, &obj_attributes,
                                    &io_block, file_attributes, share_access,
                                    create_disposition, create_options, NULL,
                                    0, client_info.process);

  *io_information = io_block.Information;
  return true;
}

```
## The bug

Let's compare both `OpenFileAction` to `CreateFileAccess`

```
// source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/filesystem_policy.cc
bool FileSystemPolicy::OpenFileAction(EvalResult eval_result,
                                      const ClientInfo& client_info,
                                      const base::string16& file,
                                      uint32_t attributes,
                                      uint32_t desired_access,
                                      uint32_t share_access,
                                      uint32_t open_options,
                                      HANDLE* handle,
                                      NTSTATUS* nt_status,
                                      ULONG_PTR* io_information) {
  // The only action supported is ASK_BROKER which means open the requested
  // file as specified.
  if (ASK_BROKER != eval_result) {
    *nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true; // this line is different!
  }
  // An NtOpen is equivalent to an NtCreate with FileAttributes = 0 and
  // CreateDisposition = FILE_OPEN.
  IO_STATUS_BLOCK io_block = {};
  UNICODE_STRING uni_name = {};
  OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES obj_attributes = {};
  SECURITY_QUALITY_OF_SERVICE security_qos = GetAnonymousQOS();

  InitObjectAttribs(file, attributes, NULL, &obj_attributes,
                    &uni_name, IsPipe(file) ? &security_qos : NULL);
  *nt_status = NtCreateFileInTarget(handle, desired_access, &obj_attributes,
                                    &io_block, 0, share_access, FILE_OPEN,
                                    open_options, NULL, 0,
                                    client_info.process);

  *io_information = io_block.Information;
  return true;
}

```

In `OpenFileAction`, the following code is incorrect:

```
  if (ASK_BROKER != eval_result) {
    *nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;
  }

```

The return value should be `false` instead of `true`.

`OpenFileAction` is called by the `FilesystemDispatcher::NtOpenFile` crosscall as follows :

```
bool FilesystemDispatcher::NtOpenFile(IPCInfo* ipc,
                                      base::string16* name,
                                      uint32_t attributes,
                                      uint32_t desired_access,
                                      uint32_t share_access,
                                      uint32_t open_options) {
  // [...]
  HANDLE handle; // not initialized
  ULONG_PTR io_information = 0;
  NTSTATUS nt_status;
  // can bail out early without modifying handle and while also returning true
  if (!FileSystemPolicy::OpenFileAction(result, *ipc->client_info, *name,
                                        attributes, desired_access,
                                        share_access, open_options, &handle,
                                        &nt_status, &io_information)) {
    ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;
  }
  // Return operation status on the IPC.
  ipc->return_info.extended[0].ulong_ptr = io_information;
  ipc->return_info.nt_status = nt_status;
  ipc->return_info.handle = handle; // handle can be uninitialized here
  return true;
}

```

When the condition `ASK_BROKER != eval_result` is `true`, access to the file is denied and the broker should then execute

```
    ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;

```

But as we saw previously, that is not case and we would therefore execute the following lines :

```
  ipc->return_info.extended[0].ulong_ptr = io_information;
  ipc->return_info.nt_status = nt_status;
  ipc->return_info.handle = handle;

```

`io_information` is set to 0 and nt\_status would be set to `STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`.

However the handle is not initialized! Therefore, the broker will put some uninitialized stack memory in the shared memory when executing `ipc->return_info.handle = handle`

## Leaking the broker's memory

### Triggering the bug

Long story short, to trigger the bug, you only need to make an `NtOpenFile` crosscall on a file for which access would be denied.

It is required to manually read the shared memory or do the call to `CrossCall` directly because `TargetNtOpenFile` checks `answer.nt_status` and does not fetch shared memory the the `nt_status` is an error code (which is what we expect). The line `*file = answer.handle;` would not get executed.

But as this is renderer code, you can do whatever you want. Either call `CrossCall` (or make your own) or scan the shared memory.

```

ResultCode code = CrossCall(ipc, IPC_NTOPENFILE_TAG, name, attributes,
                                desired_access_uint32, sharing, options_uint32,
                                &answer);
    if (SBOX_ALL_OK != code)
      break;

    status = answer.nt_status;

    if (!NT_SUCCESS(answer.nt_status)) // (renderer side) nt_status != NT_SUCCESS
      break;

    __try {
      *file = answer.handle; // here you would fetch the leaked data from the shared memory
      io_status->Status = answer.nt_status;
      io_status->Information = answer.extended[0].ulong_ptr;
    } __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER) {
      break;
    }

```

The trigger would roughly look like this.

```
RtlInitUnicodeString(&filename, L"\\??\\C:\\");
InitializeObjectAttributes(&obj_attr, &filename, OBJ_CASE_INSENSITIVE, NULL, NULL);
NtOpenFile(&file, FILE_WRITE_DATA, &obj_attr, &iostatusblock, 1, NULL);
readSharedMemory()

```
### Getting a function pointer

We need to make sure that the stack contains something interesting. If you try to open the file `L"\\??\\C:\\secret\\canttouchme.txt"`, you would not get anything interesting. The return handle would actually be the number of characters of the file name (in this case, 0x1D).

Indeed, when receiving the signal for a crosscall, the broker would first execute the function `sandbox::SharedMemIPCServer::InvokeCallback`.

```
bool SharedMemIPCServer::InvokeCallback(const ServerControl* service_context,
                                        void* ipc_buffer,
                                        CrossCallReturn* call_result) {
// [...]
  if (!GetArgs(params.get(), &ipc_params, args))
    return false;
// [...]
  if (handler) {
    switch (params->GetParamsCount()) {
// [...]
      case 7: {
        Dispatcher::Callback7 callback =
            reinterpret_cast<Dispatcher::Callback7>(callback_generic);
        if (!(handler->*callback)(&ipc_info, args[0], args[1], args[2], args[3],
                                  args[4], args[5], args[6]))
          break;
        error = false;
        break;
      }
// [...]
}

```

The function `GetArgs` will fetch the arguments from the shared memory.

For every argument, it will call a function `GetRawParameterXXX`.

Henceforth, when fetching the filename parameter, `GetParameterStr`will get called.

```
// Fills up the list of arguments (args and ipc_params) for an IPC call.
bool GetArgs(CrossCallParamsEx* params, IPCParams* ipc_params,
             void* args[kMaxIpcParams]) {
  // [...]
  for (uint32_t i = 0; i < params->GetParamsCount(); i++) {
    uint32_t size;
    ArgType type;
    args[i] = params->GetRawParameter(i, &size, &type);
    if (args[i]) {
      ipc_params->args[i] = type;
      switch (type) {
        case WCHAR_TYPE: {
          std::unique_ptr<base::string16> data(new base::string16);
          if (!params->GetParameterStr(i, data.get())) {
            args[i] = 0;
            ReleaseArgs(ipc_params, args);
            return false;
          }
          args[i] = data.release();
          break;
        }
        // [...]
      }
    }
  }
  return true;
}

```

The code of `GetParameterStr` is the following :

```
bool CrossCallParamsEx::GetParameterStr(uint32_t index,
                                        base::string16* string) {
 // [...]
  void* start = GetRawParameter(index, &size, &type);
 // [...]
  string->append(reinterpret_cast<wchar_t*>(start), size/(sizeof(wchar_t)));
  return true;
}

```

If you read the disassembly, you find the following instructions :

```
mov     ebx, [esi+14h]
mov     edx, [esi+10h]
mov     edi, eax
shr     edi, 1
mov     [ebp+var_18], ebx
sub     ebx, edx
cmp     ebx, edi
jnb     short loc_4162A0

```

Thoses instructions check if the length of the file name is greater than the length of the parameter string. When debugging, we see than the original capacity of the string is of 7 characters. So we compare the number of characters of the file name to 7.

In the case of a greater string such as `L"\\??\\C:\\secret\\canttouchme.txt"`, the following basic block is executed.

```
sub     esp, 10h
mov     al, [ebp+var_14]
mov     [esp+28h+var_24], al
mov     [esp+28h+var_20], ecx
mov     ecx, esi
mov     [esp+28h+var_1C], edi
mov     [esp+28h+same_address_as_the_uninitialized_handle], edi // look here!
call    std::basic_string<wchar_t,std::char_traits<wchar_t>,std::allocator<wchar_t>>::_Reallocate_grow_by<`std::basic_string<wchar_t,std::char_traits<wchar_t>,std::allocator<wchar_t>>::append(wchar_t const * const,uint)'::`1'::_lambda_1_,wchar_t const *,uint>(uint,`std::basic_string<wchar_t,std::char_traits<wchar_t>,std::allocator<wchar_t>>::append(wchar_t const * const,uint)'::`1'::_lambda_1_,wchar_t const *,uint)
jmp     short loc_416284

```

This will store the number of characters of the file name string. This is something an attacker does not want to happen because it is a completely irrelevant information.

But what happens if the string is smaller? A valid file name could be `L"\\??\\C:\\"`.

The following lines would get executed instead :

```
loc_4162AD:
and     eax, 0FFFFFFFEh
lea     edx, [esi+edx*2]
push    eax             ; Size
push    ecx             ; Src
push    edx             ; Dst
call    _memmove // return address == uninitialized handle value
add     esp, 0Ch

```

This is a much better thing because it doesn't write the string length on the address that will later correspond to the uninitialized handle.

Let's do an NtOpenFile crosscall with the filename `L"\\??\\C:\\"` and use `FILE_WRITE_DATA` as a `DesiredAccessMask` like this :

```
NtOpenFileStruct(&file, FILE_WRITE_DATA, &obj_attrib, &io_status_block, 1, NULL);

```

Now have a look at the leaking handle and see what it belong when attaching to the broker process.

```

*** WARNING: Unable to verify checksum for c:\mozilla-source\mozilla-central\obj-i686-pc-mingw32\dist\bin\firefox.exe
 [c:\mozilla-source\mozilla-central\security\sandbox\chromium\sandbox\win\src\crosscall_server.cc @ 293] (00266200)   firefox!sandbox::CrossCallParamsEx::GetParameterStr+0xbb   |  (002662d0)   firefox!sandbox::SetCallError

```

So basically, instead of leaking a string size, we leak a function pointer that corresponds to the return address pushed on the stack while executing the `_memmove` called by `GetParameterStr`.

This demonstrates that this bug does leak some sensitive information from the broker and that it is possible to get different kind of data by playing with the crosscall parameters.

## Testing it

### DLL injection

To play with the sandbox without using a renderer RCE bug, a simple way to do that is using reflective DLL injection. However, Firefox prevents that by hooking the function `kernel32!BaseThreadInitThunk`

```
0:028> u KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk
KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk:
763e8460 e99bc87bde      jmp     mozglue!patched_BaseThreadInitThunk (54ba4d00)
763e8465 51              push    ecx

```

Therefore, simply patch the `JMP` by the standard `MOV EDI, EDI`.

```
KERNEL32!BaseThreadInitThunk:
763e8460 8bff            mov     edi,edi
763e8462 55              push    ebp

```

                       // and do not do IPC.
  TERMINATE_PROCESS,  // Destroy target process. Do IPC as well.
};

```

If the file we're trying to open gets an DENY\_ACCESS `EvalResult` instead of `ASK_BROKER`, the bug will be triggered.

The disassembly shows that the handle does stay uninitialized.

## Bug variants

#### NtOpenKey unitialized handle leak

The `NtOpenKey` dispatcher (broker side) contains the exact same bug and will also write an uninitialized `HANDLE` in the shared memory. Me might be able to leak different kind of information using this bug because the handle variable would be allocated at a different place on the stack.

```
bool RegistryDispatcher::NtOpenKey(IPCInfo* ipc,
                                   base::string16* name,
                                   uint32_t attributes,
                                   HANDLE root,
                                   uint32_t desired_access) {
// [...]
  HANDLE handle; // not initialized
  NTSTATUS nt_status;
  if (!RegistryPolicy::OpenKeyAction(result, *ipc->client_info, *name,
                                     attributes, root, desired_access, &handle,
                                     &nt_status)) {
    ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;
  }

  // Return operation status on the IPC.
  ipc->return_info.nt_status = nt_status;
  ipc->return_info.handle = handle; // may be uninitialized
  return true;
}

```
```
bool RegistryPolicy::OpenKeyAction(EvalResult eval_result,
                                   const ClientInfo& client_info,
                                   const base::string16& key,
                                   uint32_t attributes,
                                   HANDLE root_directory,
                                   uint32_t desired_access,
                                   HANDLE* handle,
                                   NTSTATUS* nt_status) {
  // The only action supported is ASK_BROKER which means open the requested
  // file as specified.
  if (ASK_BROKER != eval_result) {
    *nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true; // should be balse, handle is not written
  }
// [...]
  return true;
}

```
#### Misc

An incorrect behaviour can also be observed in the following functions:

* NtQueryAttributesFile
* NtQueryFullAttributesFile
* NtSetInformationFile

However, they don't lead to any information disclosure as the don't write anything interesting back to the shared memory.

For instance, even though `QueryAttributesFileAction` could incorrectly return the value `true`, it would only lead to execute `ipc->return_info.nt_status = nt_status` instead of `ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED`.

```
  if (!FileSystemPolicy::QueryAttributesFileAction(result, *ipc->client_info,
                                                   *name, attributes,
                                                   information, &nt_status)) {
    ipc->return_info.nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return true;
  }

  // Return operation status on the IPC.
  ipc->return_info.nt_status = nt_status;
  return true;

```
## Code history

When working on this bug, as firefox initially forked the chromium sandbox, we might wonder if this bug also affects chromium. It does not.

Indeed, chromium actually changed the code back in September 2017.

The current filesystem policy code in chromium looks like the following :

```
bool FileSystemPolicy::OpenFileAction([...]) {
  *handle = nullptr;
// [...]
  if (ASK_BROKER != eval_result) {
    *nt_status = STATUS_ACCESS_DENIED;
    return false;
  }
// [...]
  *nt_status = NtCreateFileInTarget(
      handle, desired_access, &obj_attributes, &io_block, 0, share_access,
      FILE_OPEN, open_options, nullptr, 0, client_info.process);

// [...]
  return true;
}

```

First, we can observe that the return value is correct.

Second, they also initialized the handle to `nullptr`.

Correct return values from failed brokering.

No, I meant to upload it here because:
a) I wasn't sure how that played with sec bugs and
b) I hadn't got arcanist and moz-phab set up on this machine yet and I remember it being a bit painful :-)

The patch is the non-test parts of [https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/673714/](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/%2B/673714/)

The related bug is still hidden on their tracker for some reason, which may explain why we weren't notified about this.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: It's fairly easy, but not trivial to see what the bug is here.

  However, you would need remote code execution in the sandboxed child process already to use this, but this could possibly contribute to a sandbox escape.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Patch for m-c applies to beta, release and esr-60
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Unlikely - simple change that initialises out parameters and corrects return value.

  Also this is an existing over a year old chromium change.

Oh, so just to be explicit, this is a bug in the Chromium sandbox code, not our code or modification?

But it sounds they know about it - I assume you found this Chrome bug because they have patched it already?

FWIW, so long as you mark it with the correct bug number, phabricator review will be restricted based on the bug access.

Yes, they patched it over a year ago, I must have just missed it with our last update.

We are supposed to get notified of security bugs once they are fixed and on their way to release.

It depends on a status change, which I'm guessing didn't happen for this bug.

Dan - it would be interesting to know if you can see the chromium bug:

Thanks, yeah that's why I subsequently pushed it to phabricator (after the still too painful set-up :-) ).

I'd originally looked here <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process>, which doesn't mention phabricator.

I've found it elsewhere on the wiki, but might be worth updating that page as well.

I cannot. It's odd for a Chrome bug to remain hidden so long after it's been fixed. Unhiding seems to be done automatically by their sheriffbot after a set time period so maybe the underlying bug is still open? I guess reach out to Will Harris or James Forshaw at Google for more info.

No, I've just landed this on Nightly (Fx68), but it's likely to be uplifted to Beta (Fx67) and ESR.

In which case, it should be released on 14th May.

A little correction of the credit:

This is only rated as moderate; do you think it's important to bring to ESR for any particular reason? For example because it may be public or from an external to mozilla report?

I'd defer to dveditz or freddyb over the actual risks here, I don't think they're too bad.

However I nominated, because this is a long standing bug that chromium fixed well over a year ago, so it's kind of public but they didn't update their bug so we didn't get notified.

Also, I guess the report is also going to be made explicitly public (on the 8th June) and the fix is pretty simple.

Hi,

Can you please change the discoverer credit to:

I can credit "Jeremy Fetiveau" in my advisory. We generally put name and company or group (if any) in advisory credit. We do not put twitter account IDs in though.

Alright, please change the credit to:

The advisory format in the header date is:

reporter: Jeremy Fetiveau

If you had a company or group affiliation, it would be:

reporter: Jeremy Fetiveau of <group here>

We don't put name credits inline in advisories as our write ups are brief descriptions of the issue fixed.

Right now, the draft advisory has your name.
