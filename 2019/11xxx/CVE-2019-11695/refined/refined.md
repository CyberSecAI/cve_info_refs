Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11695:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in the improper handling of custom cursor positioning within the browser's rendering engine. Specifically, a website-defined custom cursor can be rendered outside the boundaries of the web content area, overlapping with and potentially spoofing the browser's user interface (address bar, toolbars, etc).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate boundary enforcement:** The browser fails to restrict the rendering of custom cursors to the web content area, allowing it to extend into the browser chrome.
- **Spoofing potential:** The ability to position a custom cursor over the browser's UI can lead to a visual spoofing attack where the user is tricked into believing they are interacting with browser elements when they are actually interacting with the malicious web content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **UI Spoofing:** Attackers can use this vulnerability to visually mimic browser elements (like permission prompts or doorhanger notifications) and trick users into performing unintended actions, such as:
    - Granting malicious website permissions (e.g., camera, microphone, notifications).
    - Installing malicious extensions.
    - Clicking on fake dialogs, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious websites:** A website using JavaScript can define a custom cursor with a specific position and size to extend beyond the web content area.
- **User interaction:** No direct user interaction other than visiting the malicious website is needed, as the cursor manipulation happens on the website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Web server:** The attacker needs a web server to host the malicious page.
- **Basic web development skills:** The attacker must have knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement a custom cursor.
- **No specific privileges or elevated access is needed.**

**Additional Details from Bugzilla:**

- **Affected browsers:** Firefox.
- **Initial reporter:** bignis, was originally classified as invalid, then reopened.
- **Resolution:** The bug was resolved by limiting the size of custom cursors to 32 pixels when they overlap the browser's user interface.
- **Fix:** The fix was implemented as a preference to block large custom cursors outside the viewport's bounds and was made available in Firefox 67.
- **Similar issues:**  Bugzilla notes similar issues with cursor hijacking in other bugs and in Chromium, highlighting the widespread nature of this issue.

In summary, CVE-2019-11695 is a moderate-severity vulnerability where a website can use a custom cursor to spoof the browser UI, potentially tricking users into unintended actions. The fix limits the size of custom cursors when they overlap the browser chrome to prevent such attacks.
