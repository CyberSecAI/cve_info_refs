Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11487:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `page->_refcount` reference counter within the Linux kernel. This overflow occurs when a large number of references are acquired for a given page, eventually causing the counter to wrap around to zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The 32-bit atomic reference counter `page->_refcount` is susceptible to wrapping around to zero upon reaching its maximum value, leading to subsequent use-after-free issues.
*   **Use-After-Free:** When the reference counter wraps around and becomes zero, the kernel may free the associated memory page while it is still in use.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The use-after-free condition can lead to a kernel panic and system crash.
*   **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** The use-after-free condition could potentially allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the memory after it has been freed.
*   **Limited Remote Exploitation:** While the primary attack vector is local, the `mincore()` implementation could allow limited remote exploitation, specifically by observing access patterns.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation via FUSE:** A local attacker can exploit the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) subsystem to trigger the overflow by creating many FUSE requests, making it the primary attack vector.
*    **Local Exploitation Via Pipes:** A local attacker can also trigger this vulnerability using pipes.
*   **Limited Remote Exploitation via mincore():** Access patterns in shared files (e.g. from an Apache server) can be remotely observed through latency differences, potentially allowing some limited remote exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The primary attack vector requires local access to the system.
*   **Unprivileged User:** The local user needs the ability to create FUSE mount points (though limited by fusermount) and/or use pipes.
*   **Large Memory Resources:** The attack also requires significant memory allocation, which might be a limiting factor for some attackers.
*   **Controlled Network (for Remote Exploitation):** Limited remote exploitation, specifically by observing latency differences in accessing files through mincore(), may be possible.

**Additional Details from Analysis:**

*   **Mitigation:** The fix involves preventing the page reference counter from going negative by adding a check and introducing a `try_get_page()` function that will fail to take a new page reference if the counter is approaching overflow.
*   **Affected Code:** The issue involves multiple kernel components like `fs/fuse/dev.c`, `fs/pipe.c`, `fs/splice.c`, `include/linux/mm.h`, `include/linux/pipe_fs_i.h`, `kernel/trace/trace.c`, `mm/gup.c`, and `mm/hugetlb.c`.
*   **Specific to openSUSE:** The vulnerability is present in the openSUSE Leap 15.0, 15.1 and 42.3, where the update provides fixes for the identified CVEs and numerous other bugs.
*   **Specific to Ubuntu:** The vulnerability is also present in several Ubuntu releases like 16.04 ESM and 18.04 ESM ,where patches are required.
*   **Specific to Red Hat:**  Red Hat indicates that this vulnerability is mitigated through an improved checking procedure for the page refcount.
*    **Specific to Linux kernel:** The vulnerability was resolved with the addition of a new `try_get_page()` to prevent the reference count from overflowing and causing use-after-free errors.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description, which is brief and only states: "The Linux kernel before 5.1-rc5 allowed page->\_refcount reference count overflow, with resultant use-after-free issues, if about 140 GiB of RAM exists. This is related to fs/fuse/dev.c, fs/pipe.c, fs/splice.c, include/linux/mm.h, include/linux/pipe\_fs\_i.h, kernel/trace/trace.c, mm/gup.c, and mm/hugetlb.c. It can occur with FUSE requests (bnc#1133190)."
