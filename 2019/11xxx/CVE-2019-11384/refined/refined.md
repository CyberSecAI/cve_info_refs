The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Zalora Android application, where user passwords are stored in plaintext in a backup file. This vulnerability is not related to the specified CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Zalora Android application stores user passwords in plaintext within the `login_data.xml` file located in the application's shared preferences.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Plaintext storage of passwords:** Passwords are not encrypted or hashed, making them easily readable if the application's backup data is accessed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to a user's Zalora account by extracting the plaintext password from a backup of the application's data.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Local access to device:** An attacker can create a backup of the application's data using ADB (Android Debug Bridge) if they have local access to the device or if the device has debugging enabled and ADB access through network.
*  **Access to backups:** After obtaining the backup file, an attacker would need to extract the contents of the backup and navigate to the location where the sensitive data is stored.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have physical access to the device or network access to the device's debugging interface.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of how to create and extract backups of Android applications using tools like ADB and abe.jar.
*   The attacker needs to be able to locate the file where the password is stored within the extracted backup.
