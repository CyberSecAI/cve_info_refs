- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Information exposure through process environment. The Synology Calendar application was exposing credentials through the command-line interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Credentials were being passed via the command-line arguments, which is a known insecure practice, making them accessible to local users who can inspect running processes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local user with high privileges and the ability to monitor running processes could obtain sensitive information, specifically credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access to the application and related services.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, specifically the ability to monitor running processes and view command line arguments.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must be a local user with high privileges to monitor processes, and the ability to view command-line arguments.
