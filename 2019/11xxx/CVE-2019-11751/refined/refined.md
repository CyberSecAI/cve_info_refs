Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**1. CVE-2019-11751: Malicious Code Execution Through Command Line Parameters**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of logging-related command-line parameters when Firefox is launched by another program.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of proper input sanitization, allowing arbitrary command-line arguments to be passed to Firefox.
*   **Impact:** Allows an attacker to write a log file to an arbitrary location, potentially including the Windows "Startup" folder, which leads to arbitrary code execution upon system restart.
*   **Attack Vector:** A user clicks on a malicious link in a chat application or other application that invokes Firefox.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to entice the user to click on a malicious link or file from the chat application, and the attack only affects Windows.

**2. CVE-2019-11752: Use-after-Free While Extracting a Key Value in IndexedDB**

*   **Root Cause:** A use-after-free vulnerability when deleting an IndexedDB key value and subsequently trying to extract it during conversion.
*   **Weaknesses:** Use of freed memory, which can lead to memory corruption.
*  **Impact**: Potentially exploitable crash.
*   **Attack Vector:** Triggered by malicious code that interacts with IndexedDB.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to execute code within the browser context, which could come from a malicious website.

**3. CVE-2019-11753: Privilege Escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service**

*   **Root Cause:** Firefox installer allows custom user writable install location, making it vulnerable to manipulation. The Mozilla Maintenance Service lacks integrity checks when updating from user-writable install paths.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of validation for custom installation locations, lack of integrity checks when updating, a  vulnerable maintenance service in the user's directory.
*   **Impact:** An altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges, allowing for privilege escalation.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with local system access manipulates the Firefox installation and maintenance service.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Requires local system access on Windows systems.

**4. CVE-2019-9811: Sandbox Escape via Malicious Language Pack and Firefox Sync**

*   **Root Cause:** A sandbox escape can be achieved by installing a malicious language pack and then opening a browser feature that used the compromised translation.
*   **Weaknesses:**  Inadequate input validation of language packs.
*   **Impact:**  Allows a sandbox escape and potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Installation of a malicious language pack and accessing content that triggers the malicious translation.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to convince the user to install a malicious language pack.

**5. CVE-2019-11749: Camera Information Available Without Prompting**

*   **Root Cause:** WebRTC's `getUserMedia` API allows probing of camera device properties without triggering a user prompt or notification.
*   **Weaknesses:** The API leaks device properties by design and lacks proper validation.
*   **Impact:** Device fingerprinting of users by leaking properties of their cameras.
*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious web content using probing techniques via the `getUserMedia` API.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A malicious website that a user visits is needed.

**6. CVE-2019-11750: Type Confusion in SpiderMonkey**
*   **Root Cause**: A type confusion vulnerability in SpiderMonkey.
*  **Weaknesses**: Improper handling of data types in JavaScript.
*  **Impact**: Non-exploitable crash (as mentioned in the text).
*   **Attack Vector**: Malicious Javascript code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: Requires a malicious website to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Many of these vulnerabilities are specific to Windows or require a compromised process or user to initiate them, indicating a reliance on a multi-step attack vector.
*   Mozilla has rated all of these vulnerabilities as having critical (11751), important (9811, 11746), or moderate (11753, 11749, 11750) severity.
*   SUSE rated CVE-2019-11751 as "important" and  CVE-2019-11753 as "moderate", while matching the severity of the rest.
*   The provided text also includes the fixed package versions for various SUSE products.
* The vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11751 resurrects a previous issue fixed in CVE-2007-3670 but through a different vulnerability in argument handling.
* The SUSE document provides information on the fix status and list of fixed package version for the CVEs related to Firefox.
* The wiki.mozilla.org page is unrelated to the CVE and contains generic information about bugzilla field descriptions.
