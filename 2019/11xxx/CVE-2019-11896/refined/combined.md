## Summary

Recently discovered security vulnerabilities affect the Bosch Smart Home Controller (SHC, âthe deviceâ). They potentially allow to obtain elevated privileges, read and write data and perform a denial of service on the device via the network interface. Bosch Smart Home rates these vulnerabilities with CVSSv3 environmental scores from 3.0 (Low) to 7.6 (High), where the actual rating depends on the individual vulnerability, and recommends customers to install updated firmware versions on all devices.

As of May 22nd, 2019, an updated firmware file is available and offered to all customers via the existing update mechanism. A previously available update already covered all vulnerabilities in this advisory except CVE-2019-11896.

As of May 29th, 2019, there is currently no indication that exploitation code is either publicly known or utilized.

The vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed to Bosch in a coordinated manner by the external researcher Philip Kazmeier.

## Affected Products

* Bosch Smart Home Controller < 9.8.905 for all listed vulnerabilities except CVE-2019-11896
* Bosch Smart Home Controller < 9.8.907 for CVE-2019-11896

## Solution

### Firmware Update (Device)

The recommended approach is to update the firmware of all Bosch Smart Home Controllers to a fixed version, that is, 9.8.907 or higher. Version 9.8.905, available since April 17th, 2019, already covered all vulnerabilities in this advisory except CVE-2019-11896.

### Mitigations and Workarounds

**Firewalling (Network)**

It is advised that the device should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes port-forwarding, which would not protect the device adequately.

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2019-11891 (App Pairing)

This vulnerability is classified as âCWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignmentâ, located in the app pairing mechanism. The fix ensures proper privilege assignment.

### Remark

Vulnerability classification has been performed using the
[CVSSv3 scoring system](http://www.first.org/cvss/)
.
The CVSS environmental score is specific to each customerâs environment and should be defined by the customer to attain a final scoring.
