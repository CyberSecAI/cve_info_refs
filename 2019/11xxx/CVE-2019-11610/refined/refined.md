{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization and permission checks in the `downloaddir.php` file within the file management module of the doorGets CMS. The application fails to validate the provided 'd' parameter, which specifies the directory to be downloaded as a zip archive. Due to the absence of proper filtering, the attacker can specify an arbitrary directory on the server and download its content.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal Vulnerability",
      "Missing Access Control",
      "Information Disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to obtain server-sensitive information by downloading arbitrary directories on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTTP GET request to the `downloaddir.php` file, providing the 'd' parameter with a manipulated directory path that traverses outside of the intended directory. This path can be used to obtain sensitive files and data.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker does not need any special authentication to exploit this vulnerability, only the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server."
