## Multiple vulnerabilities in SanDisk X600 SATA SED SSD

---

**WDC Tracking Number:** WDC-19006

**Published:** May 20, 2019

**Last Updated:** May 23, 2019

#### Description

The SanDisk X600 SATA SED SSD is vulnerable to an attack where data stored and encrypted by the device may be decrypted without knowledge of proper authentication credentials. Additionally, the device is vulnerable to an attack where inauthentic firmware updates may be installed. A firmware update that addresses the protection of data stored on the drive is available.

#### Update Availability:

To install the firmware update on the following model numbers, please download and install the [**SanDisk SSD Dashboard**](https://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/15108):

* SD9TB8W-XXXX-1122
* SD9TN8W-XXXX-1122
* SD9TB8W-XXXX (no extension code)
* SD9TN8W-XXXX (no extension code)

In the SanDisk SSD Dashboard application, select Tools/Firmware Update to check for and update the firmware on your drive.

For all other impacted model numbers, please contact your system vendor for the applicable firmware update.

**Tracking number:** WDC-19006

#### Advisory Summary

In the following configurations, a vulnerability in the access control mechanism of the drive may allow data to be decrypted without knowledge of proper authentication credentials.

* If the Opal SSC is activated and configured with more than one LBA range enabled, and at least one range does not have read or write locking enabled, the contents of any ranges with both read and write locking enabled may be decrypted through an improperly protected intermediate key.
* If the Opal SSC was previously activated on the drive, then deactivated, and the ATA security feature set is enabled on the drive, the contents of the drive may be decrypted through an improperly protected intermediate key.
* If the ATA security feature set is enabled in the Maximum mode, the Master password may be used to decrypt the content of the drive through an improperly protected intermediate key.

Western Digital periodically retains the services of third-party firms to audit and test the security of our products. For this firmware patch, the security firm [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com) was engaged to review the changes made to the cryptographic access control mechanism. In order to provide transparency to our customers, we have elected to make a [summary of the audit report](/content/dam/western-digital/en-us/assets/support/sandisk-x600-sed-security-assessment-public.pdf) available to the public.

**Mitigation**

The following mitigations are available for this issue:

* Install the firmware patch available for your SSD. For drives configured using TCG Opal, the access control mechanism will be updated upon first power on of the drive following installation of the update. For drives configured using ATA security, the access control mechanism will be updated upon first unlock fo the drive following the update.
* If the firmware patch cannot be installed, for drives configured using TCG Opal, ensure that all ranges on the disk are configured with read and write locking enabled.
* If the firmware patch cannot be installed, for drives configured using ATA security, ensure that the drive is configured using the High mode.
* Use software encryption.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2019-10705](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10705)

**Reported by:** Carlo Meijer (Radboud University, the Netherlands) and Bernard van Gastel (Radboud University, the Netherlands, Open University of the Netherlands)

#### Advisory Summary

A vulnerability in the wear-leveling algorithm of the drive may cause cryptographically sensitive parameters (such as data encryption keys) to remain on the drive media after their intended erasure.

**Mitigation:**

* Install the firmware patch available for your SSD.
* Use software encryption.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2019-11686](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11686)

**Reported by:** Carlo Meijer (Radboud University, the Netherlands) and Bernard van Gastel (Radboud University, the Netherlands, Open University of the Netherlands)

Western Digital

#### Advisory Summary

The firmware update authentication method for affected devices relies on a symmetric HMAC digest. The key used to validate this digest is present in a protected area of the device, and if extracted could be used to install arbitrary firmware to any X600 device except those listed below.

The following model numbers are not affected by this issue:

* SD9TB8W-XXXX-1006
* SD9TN8W-XXXX-1006

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2019-10706](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10706)

**Reported by:** Carlo Meijer (Radboud University, the Netherlands) and Bernard van Gastel (Radboud University, the Netherlands, Open University of the Netherlands)

#### Advisory Summary

A [vulnerability in the secure boot scheme](https://www.marvell.com/documents/x9g4hrszt5ls3udbe1eo/) may allow internally protected parameters to be extracted.

**CVE Number:** [CVE-2019-10636](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10636)

**Reported by:** Carlo Meijer (Radboud University, the Netherlands) and Bernard van Gastel (Radboud University, the Netherlands, Open University of the Netherlands)

#### Manually Updating the firmware on your My Cloud Mirror

**Important: Make sure you stop all processes and save all your data before performing the firmware update.**

**Note:** **My Cloud devices require a hard drive inserted into the bay and a volume must be created to perform the firmware update.**
 Do not interrupt the firmware upgrade process. Doing so may cause the device to malfunction or unable to boot.
If you are using the manual update method, do not rename the firmware file. Doing so will cause the manual update to fail and can corrupt the system.

##### Updating the firmware on your My Cloud Mirror

1. Download the firmware to your desktop.
2. Unzip the file and you will find the actual firmware in this format: My\_Cloud\_BZVM\_2.xx.xx.bin
3. Save this to your desktop.
4. Open the My Cloud Mirror Dashboard UI.
5. Go to Settings >> Firmware Update.
6. Under the section Manual Update, click the Update From File button and a window will open.
7. Browse to where you saved the My\_Cloud\_BZVM\_2.xx.xx.bin file and select it.
8. You will see a pop up confirming to upgrade your firmware, click Ok.
