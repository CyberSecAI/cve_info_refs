### General description
The content provides a detailed description of CVE-2019-11613, among other vulnerabilities affecting doorGets CMS 7.0. CVE-2019-11613 is a SQL injection vulnerability in `\doorgets\app\views\ajax\contactView.php`.

### Root cause of vulnerability
The vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation in the `getResponse` function of `\doorgets\app\views\ajax\contactView.php`. Specifically, the values from POST requests are not properly sanitized before being used in a database query. The `dbQI` function, which calls `dbVQI`, directly splices the unsanitized `$data` into a SQL query. Although the `Params` function attempts to materialize certain characters, it fails to process backslashes (`\`), allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

### Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present
SQL Injection: Unsanitized POST data is directly incorporated into SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerability.
Insufficient Input Validation: Lack of proper input validation and sanitization of POST parameters.
Inadequate escaping: The `Params` function does not properly escape backslashes.

### Impact of exploitation
A remote, normal registered user can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information.

### Attack vectors
A remote attacker can send a crafted POST request to `/ajax/index.php?uri=contact&action=sendForm&controller=contact` with malicious SQL code in the `contact_inbox_nom` parameter. By manipulating this parameter, the attacker can inject SQL queries to extract sensitive information from the database.

### Required attacker capabilities/position
The attacker needs to be a registered user.
The attacker needs to be able to send POST requests to the specified endpoint.
