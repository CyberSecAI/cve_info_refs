Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11743:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content is directly related to CVE-2019-11743, as indicated by the presence of the CVE ID in the summary of bug report 1560495 on bugzilla.mozilla.org, which includes the alias "CVE-2019-11743". The official description of the vulnerability states: "Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.", which is the focus of the provided resources.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause is a violation of the same-origin policy in the implementation of the Navigation Timing Level 2 specification for the `unload` event. Specifically, timing attributes related to the unload event were not properly restricted to same-origin access.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The main weakness is a lack of enforcement of the same-origin policy for specific timing attributes associated with the `unload` event, allowing cross-origin access to potentially sensitive information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
    *   **Cross-origin information exposure:** An attacker can potentially extract browsing history information by measuring timing differences.
    *   **Side-channel attack:** Sensitive information could be gleaned from the timings of the unload event from cross-origin requests.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through web pages. A malicious website could attempt to access timing information from other websites by triggering navigation to or from those sites via iframes, window.open or similar mechanisms, while monitoring the unload event.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to host a malicious web page.
    *   The attacker needs to induce a user's browser to navigate (or be navigated) to a target page.
    *   The attacker needs to have javascript execution capabilities within the controlled page.

**3. Additional Technical Details (beyond the CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the `unload` event timing attributes are handled in the browser, specifically how it adheres to the "Navigation Timing Level 2" specification.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the browser respects the same-origin policy when making these timing attributes available to Javascript.
*   The issue is related to how timing information for unload events is exposed. The test case is located at `http://w3c-test.org/navigation-timing/unload-event-same-origin-check.html`.
*   The fix for this issue involved changes in multiple locations such as `dom/base/Performance.cpp`, `dom/base/nsNavigationTiming.cpp`, and `dom/base/nsDocument.cpp`.
*   The fix included a change to not expose the `unloadEventStart` and `unloadEventEnd` timings if they do not have the same origin.
*   The fix was first implemented in Firefox 69 and then backported to ESR60 and ESR68 branches.
*   The provided bug report also includes discussions on whether this should be considered a security bug, and the backporting process for the fix.
*   There is a mention of a potential fix for related test failures in bug 1571990.
