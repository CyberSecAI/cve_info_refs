- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web interface displays a link to a moved issue in the "closed (moved)" badge, even when the user does not have access to the target project.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure. The namespace and project name of a private project are leaked.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized users can learn the namespace and project name of a private project by viewing the closed issue.
- **Attack vectors:** Viewing a closed issue that was moved to a private repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to view the original issue, which was moved. This may not always require authentication (e.g. if the original issue was public).
