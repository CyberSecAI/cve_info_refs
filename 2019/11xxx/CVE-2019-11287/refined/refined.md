Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-11287:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of the `X-Reason` HTTP header within the RabbitMQ Web Management Plugin. This header allows the insertion of a malicious Erlang format string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The web management plugin does not properly sanitize or validate the input from the `X-Reason` HTTP header. This allows an attacker to inject an Erlang format string that will be processed by the server.
*   **Heap Overflow:** The malicious format string, when processed, expands to consume excessive heap memory, leading to a heap overflow condition.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The uncontrolled memory consumption results in the server crashing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** The primary impact is a denial of service, as the RabbitMQ server process crashes. This makes the message broker unavailable.
*   **Service Interruption**: As the RabbitMQ server crashes, any applications or services relying on it will experience service interruption.
*   **Resource exhaustion**: The server's memory resources are exhausted by the malicious format string, leading to the crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is triggered through a specially crafted HTTP request to the RabbitMQ Web Management Plugin.
*   **`X-Reason` Header:** The attack utilizes the `X-Reason` HTTP header to inject the malicious format string.
*   **Web Management Plugin:** The vulnerability exists in the web management plugin component of RabbitMQ.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Web Management Plugin:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the RabbitMQ web management plugin (typically on port 15672)
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the RabbitMQ Web Management interface.
*   **AMQP Connection:** An active AMQP connection to the RabbitMQ server must be present and targeted with the "Force Close" action.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to inject an Erlang format string within the "X-Reason" header of the HTTP request.

**Additional details:**

*   The provided content includes a proof-of-concept (POC) exploit demonstration showing how the "Force Close" action on a connection, when combined with the crafted header, results in a server crash.
*   The malicious payload used in the POC example is the string "~9000000000n", which forces Erlang to create a string containing 9000000000 new line characters leading to a denial of service.
*  The affected versions of RabbitMQ are 3.7.x prior to 3.7.21, 3.8.x prior to 3.8.1, and RabbitMQ for Pivotal Platform 1.16.x prior to 1.16.7, and 1.17.x prior to 1.17.4.
* Mitigation involves upgrading to fixed versions or disabling the Web Management plugin.
