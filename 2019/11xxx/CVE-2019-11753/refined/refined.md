  "CVE-2019-11753": {
    "description": "The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.\n*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "The Mozilla Maintenance Service lacks proper integrity checks and protections against manipulation when updating a Firefox installation in a user-writable location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Lack of integrity checks"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation from a local user to SYSTEM level, enabling arbitrary code execution on a Windows system.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation by manipulating the Mozilla Maintenance Service executable during an update process.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Local system access with the ability to write to the Firefox installation directory."

  "CVE-2019-9812": {
    "description": "Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading accounts.firefox.com in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 68.1, and Firefox < 69.",
    "root_cause": "A compromised sandboxed process can be used to log into a malicious Firefox sync account which can push preferences that disable the sandbox, leading to a sandbox escape.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient sandbox protections",
       "Improper synchronization of preferences"
    ],
    "impact": "Sandbox escape, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and complete system compromise.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based, requiring user interaction to load a malicious page inside a sandboxed process and log into the malicious sync account.",
     "attacker_capabilities": "Requires a pre-existing vulnerability to compromise a sandboxed content process and the ability to create a malicious Firefox sync account. Requires user interaction."

  "CVE-2019-11751": {
    "description": "Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder. *Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.* This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of proper sanitization of logging-related command-line parameters when Firefox is launched by an external program.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Path traversal vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file write vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution by writing a log file to the Windows Startup folder.",
     "attack_vectors": "Network or application based, involving luring the user to click a malicious link within another application which launches Firefox with crafted command-line parameters.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Ability to craft malicious links that trigger a Firefox launch with specific command line parameters. User interaction required to activate the malicious link."

    "description": "A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.",
    "root_cause": "Same-origin policy is not properly applied to cached image content when used with SVG filters and canvas.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Same-origin policy violation",

    "description": "The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the updates directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.\n*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*",
