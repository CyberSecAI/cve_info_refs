## Description

![@liggitt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980082?u=e6d3a90de563c894207290d21eb6987a1d45391a&v=4&size=48)[liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)opened [on Apr 18, 2019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/76797#issue-434967981)

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

The `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` method returns a copy of the provided config, with credentials removed (bearer token, username/password, and client certificate/key data).

In the following versions, `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` did not effectively clear service account credentials loaded using `rest.InClusterConfig()`:

* v1.12.0-v1.12.4
* v1.13.0

**What is the impact?**

* `k8s.io/client-go` users that use the `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` method directly with client config loaded with `rest.InClusterConfig()` receive back a client config which can still send the loaded service account token with requests.

**How was the issue fixed?**

* In 1.12.5+ and 1.13.1+, `rest.InClusterConfig()` was modified to return a client config that is safe to use with the `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` method ([Plumb token and token file through rest.Config #71713](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/71713))
* In v1.15.0, the `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()` will also exclude the `config.Transport` and `config.WrapTransport` fields, in addition to the explicit credential-carrying fields. ([Exclude custom transports when constructing AnonymousClientConfig() #75771](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/75771))

**How do I resolve the issue?**

* Upgrade `k8s.io/client-go` to `kubernetes-1.12.5`, `kubernetes-1.13.1`, `kubernetes-1.14.0`, or higher
* or manually clear the `config.WrapTransport` and `config.Transport` fields in addition to calling `rest.AnonymousClientConfig()`

Thanks to Oleg Bulatov of Red Hat for reporting this issue.
