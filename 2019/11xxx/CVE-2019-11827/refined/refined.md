- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in the SYNO.NoteStation.Shard component of Synology Note Station.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing injection of arbitrary web script or HTML. Specifically, the `object_id` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML in the context of a user's browser. This could lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is remote and involves injecting malicious scripts through the `object_id` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to manipulate the `object_id` parameter.
