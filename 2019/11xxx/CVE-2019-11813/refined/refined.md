The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11813.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of 'link' type attributes within the MISP application. Specifically, it fails to sanitize or validate the content of these link attributes, allowing for the inclusion of javascript:// links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability: The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before rendering it in the HTML context, which makes the application vulnerable to persistent XSS.
- Lack of input sanitization: The application does not sanitize or validate the link attributes, permitting the inclusion of malicious content such as 'javascript://' URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'link' attributes, which will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the affected content.
- Potential for session hijacking, data theft, and defacement: The execution of malicious JavaScript can be leveraged to steal user session data, redirect users to phishing websites, and modify the appearance of the affected pages.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts malicious link type attributes containing javascript:// links.
- The attacker injects this malicious code as an attribute value via the MISP application.
- When a user views this attribute, the injected JavaScript executes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to add or modify attributes within the MISP application.
- No specific position is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited on any view displaying the crafted attribute.
