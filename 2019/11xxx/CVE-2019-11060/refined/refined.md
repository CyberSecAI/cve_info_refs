The provided content is related to CVE-2018-11492, not CVE-2019-11060. The content describes a denial-of-service vulnerability in ASUS HG100 devices.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The device crashes due to excessive network traffic generated by tools like `hping3` and `slowhttptest`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The device is susceptible to denial-of-service attacks when bombarded with a large number of IPv4 packets or slow HTTP requests.
*   The device's web server crashes due to the attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Device crash leading to denial of service
*   The web server on the device becomes unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Sending a large number of IPv4 packets using `hping3`.
*   Sending slow HTTP requests using `slowhttptest`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same local network as the vulnerable device.
*   The attacker needs to have tools like `hping3` or `slowhttptest` available.
*   The attacker needs to know the IP address (and port for slowhttptest) of the vulnerable device.
