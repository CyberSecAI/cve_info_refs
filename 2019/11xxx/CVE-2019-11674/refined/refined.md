- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Invalid certificate validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper validation of certificates, which could allow a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A successful MitM attack could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate communications between the user and the Self Service Password Reset server.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks, where an attacker intercepts communication between the user and the server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the server, typically by being on the same network or by compromising a network device in the communication path.
