  "CVE-2019-11419": {
    "description": "The vulnerability exists in the `vcodec2_hls_filter` function within the `libvoipCodec_v7a.so` library of the WeChat application for Android. A denial-of-service (DoS) condition occurs when an attacker replaces a legitimate emoji file with a specially crafted `.wxgf` file.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is improper handling of crafted emoji files within the `vcodec2_hls_filter` function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of crafted files",
      "Lack of input validation in processing emoji files"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit results in a denial of service, causing the WeChat application to crash when a user attempts to display a message containing the replaced emoji. This prevents users from using the app.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Local: A malicious app installed on the victim's device overwrites the legitimate emoji file.",
       "File System: Writing a crafted file to the WeChat app's local storage."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a malicious application installed on the victim's Android device. The attacker also requires the ability to write to the WeChat application's local storage directory `/sdcard/tencent/MicroMsg/[User_ID]/emoji/[WXGF_ID]`.",
        "additional_information": "The exploit requires the attacker to obtain the victim's IMEI to craft the malicious emoji file correctly. The attacker replaces the existing emoji files in the user's WeChat directory, causing a crash when the app attempts to process it. The issue was reported to Tencent, but they did not consider it critical enough to fix."
