November 19, 2024Can't even sign up. It keeps on telling me "Unusual network or device environment. Try using a stable connection". The earlier stage of verification is also having problems. Like "choose two trees in winter" I pressed it, it said success then failed. Which one do you want? What's even the point of asking for it if it's not going to work. What's up with "invite another user to complete registration"? Unnecessary steps. I don't know if the devs are going to read this but fix those issues asap1,525 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocI-s7-UoptFa8Alrm6dh2du6fYQ3J7Nu6q57LotLmtn7uPGFQ=s32-rw-mo)lehakoe whitby*more\_vert*

December 12, 2024The QR code doesn't even work when i do ask friends all it says is it's expired. When I search it it says it's either expired or deleted. I can't sign up at all. It's annoying, I've been trying everything you can think of I tried deleting it, clearing data,clearing cache and re installing it but stilll the qr code doesn't work. Please fix this because not even signing up via Facebook works I really need to use this app in order to communicate in china.107 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVHaNYUjWHzgA9mrihLWEWd6L5k-CQxWuw4J_Bvb9ceWOZgGEHR=s32-rw)Jackson Kaleta*more\_vert*

December 2, 2024Spent 20min trying to set up a WeChat account. A constant loop of asking for verifications, and to topic off they wanted to use a bank card and take money out of your account. One of the most frustrating apps to use. There is a reason why WhatsApp is popular. Its set up is easy and straightforward, they don't ask for money as verification and the WhatsApp is far more superior in everyday use. Additionally is the app opens itself everytime your in a conversation with someone (no privacy).57 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviews

* [Affected Product Code Base:](#affected-product-code-base)
* [Affected Component:](#affected-component)
* [Attack Type:](#attack-type)
* [Attack vector:](#attack-vector)
* [POC:](#poc)

This DoS bug was reported to Tencent, but they decided not to fix because it’s not critical. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program has assigned the ID CVE-2019-11419 to this issue.

## Description:

vcodec2\_hls\_filter in libvoipCodec\_v7a.so in WeChat application for Android results in a DoS by replacing an emoji file (under the /sdcard/tencent/MicroMsg directory) with a crafted .wxgf file.
Crash-log is provided in poc.zip file at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HFQtbD10awuUicdWoq3dKVKfv0wvxOKS

## Vulnerability Type:

Denial of Service

## Vendor of Product:

Tencent

## Affected Product Code Base:

WeChat for Android - Up to latest version (7.0.3)

## Affected Component:

Function vcodec2\_hls\_filter in libvoipCodec\_v7a.so

## Attack Type:

Local

## Attack vector:

An malware app can crafts a malicious emoji file and overwrites the emoji files under `/sdcard/tencent/MicroMsg/[User_ID]/emoji/[WXGF_ID]`. Once the user opens any chat messages that contain an emoji, WeChat will instantly crash.

## POC:

Video at https://drive.google.com/open?id=1x1Z3hm4j8f4rhv\_WUp4gW-bhdtZMezdU

* User must have sent or received a GIF file in WeChat
* Malware app must retrieve the phone’s IMEI. For POC, we can use the below command
  ```
  adb shell service call iphonesubinfo 1 | awk -F "'" '{print $2}' | sed '1 d' | tr -d '.' | awk '{print}' ORS=-

  ```
* Produce the malicious emoji file with the retrieved IMEI (use encrypt\_wxgf.py in poc.zip):
  ```
  python encrypt.py crash4.wxgf [SIZE_OF_EMOJI_ON_SDCARD]

  ```
* Replace /sdcard/tencent/MicroMsg/[User\_ID]/emoji/[WXGF\_ID] with the padded out.wxgf.encrypted
* WeChat will crash now if a message that contains the overwritten emoji file

lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
