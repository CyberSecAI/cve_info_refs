  "CVE-2019-11750": {
    "description": "A type confusion vulnerability exists in Spidermonkey, which results in a non-exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "The definite properties analysis in SpiderMonkey had a flaw where it would incorrectly handle prototype chains, leading to a type confusion between \"undefined\" and a normal object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion due to incorrect handling of prototype chains in definite properties analysis.",
       "Incomplete sanitization of command-line logging parameters"
    ],
    "impact": "A type confusion leading to a non-exploitable crash. There is also a risk of arbitrary code execution, although it is not confirmed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Exploiting a vulnerability through crafted JavaScript code."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to execute malicious JavaScript in a vulnerable browser session.",
        "additional_info": "The provided SUSE information also indicates that a related vulnerability, CVE-2019-11751, involves command line logging parameters being improperly sanitized when Firefox is launched by other applications. This can lead to writing log files to arbitrary locations like the Windows Startup folder."

  "CVE-2019-11753": {
    "description": "The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.  *Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "Lack of integrity checks in the Mozilla Maintenance Service when updating Firefox from a custom, user-writable installation location.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure custom install location allowing manipulation by unprivileged users or malware.",
      "Lack of integrity checks for the maintenance service during update.",
      "Privilege escalation due to lack of sanitization of command line logging parameters when firefox is launched by another program"
    ],
    "impact": "Privilege escalation, where a local attacker can gain elevated privileges by manipulating the maintenance service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local system access is required to manipulate the Firefox installation.",
      "The user must have previously installed Firefox in a user writable location."
      
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs local access to the system, and the ability to write files to the custom Firefox install location. Also, user interaction is required when user clicks on a malicious link."

  "CVE-2019-11752": {
    "description": "It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability triggered by attempting to extract a deleted key value from IndexedDB during conversion.",

  "CVE-2019-11749": {
    "description": "A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the getUserMedia API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "Inadequate input sanitization of WebRTC getUserMedia API constraints, allowing device properties of cameras to be exposed without a prompt.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure through the WebRTC getUserMedia API.",
