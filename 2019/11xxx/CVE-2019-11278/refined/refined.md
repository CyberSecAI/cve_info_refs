Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11278:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Cloud Foundry User Account and Authentication (UAA) service prior to version 74.1.0 directly queries external input, without proper sanitization or validation, against its database. This allows for SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SCIM Injection:**  The UAA service is vulnerable to SCIM injection via crafted queries. Since there is no mention of direct output from these queries, this is likely a blind injection vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The UAA service does not properly validate or sanitize external input before using it in database queries.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A user with specific permissions can exploit this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious user can gain control of UAA scopes that they should not have.
- **Information Leakage:** Sensitive information can be leaked via the crafted SCIM queries. This leaked information allows the escalation of privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **SCIM Queries:** The attack vector is through crafted SCIM queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **'client.write' and 'groups.update' Permissions:** The attacker needs to have the `client.write` and `groups.update` permissions within the Cloud Foundry environment.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability in Cloud Foundry UAA allows remote attackers with specific permissions (`client.write` and `groups.update`) to perform blind SCIM injection, leaking information and potentially gaining unauthorized access to UAA scopes. The root cause lies in insufficient input validation of user-supplied data before being used in database queries.
