Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11027:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `ruby-openid` library performing discovery before verification. This order of operations allows an attacker to manipulate the URL used for discovery.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** By changing the discovery URL, an attacker can force the server using the library to connect to an arbitrary URL, including private servers not publicly accessible.
*   **Information Disclosure:** If the client application using the `ruby-openid` library exposes connection errors, it can leak information about the private server to the attacker.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass Authentication:**  An attacker can potentially bypass authentication by tricking the server into connecting to a malicious or controlled endpoint, leading to unauthorized access.
*  **Private Server Information Disclosure:**  An attacker can learn about the internal infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Manipulated Discovery URL:** The attacker modifies the URL used in the discovery phase of the OpenID authentication process.
*   **OpenID Relying Party:** The vulnerability lies within the client-side implementation of the OpenID protocol, specifically how the `ruby-openid` library handles the discovery phase.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept or influence the communication between the client and the OpenID provider.
*   **Ability to Manipulate URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the URL used by the `ruby-openid` library during the discovery process. This could involve a man-in-the-middle attack or through other means of influencing the OpenID request.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was present in `ruby-openid` versions prior to 2.9.2.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the OpenID Foundation and a fix was implemented in version 2.9.2 of the library.
*   The issue was initially reported to the `openid-security` mailing list.
*   The vulnerability is described as remotely exploitable.
