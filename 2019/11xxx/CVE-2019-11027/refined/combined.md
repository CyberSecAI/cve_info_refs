The bitkeeper sources ebuilds download the main version from mysql mirror system and then the patch from mine (3-4Mb).  The most important result is that this ebuild can manage both 4.1 and 5.0 versions with pratically no change in the ebuild code (probably 4.0 too).  Pay attention at the pkg_config() function, it doesn't use mysql_install_db anymore.  The htmlized version of the ebuild is here  <http://www.francesco-riosa.com/gentoo/mysql-5.0.3_alpha20050213.ebuild.html>  The patch versus the best installable in gentoo is  <http://www.francesco-riosa.com/gentoo/mysql-4-5.ebuild.patch.html>  Should be nice have an opinion from one developer.  regards Francesco Riosa ```  [Comment 9](#c9)  Jeff Smelser    2005-02-22 07:42:13 UTC  ``` I have the latest 5.0 ebuild, and federated isnt supported in the ebuild.

Since I never had time to go deep there is a workaround in nightly ebuilds:  # ebuild "${PORTDIR_OVERLAY}/dev-db/mysql/mysql-5.0.5_beta20050412.ebuild" config  this will create the databases and ask you for a password. I'm not testing this from one month now, please report if it not work anymore.  ```  [Comment 14](#c14)  Daniel Kasak    2005-04-18 18:39:35 UTC  ``` Right. Now I can create stored procedures, but all other sp operations result in a server crash, including:  DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS `procedure_name`; call `procedure_name` ();  The mysql client will report that:  ERROR 2013 (HY000): Lost connection to MySQL server during query  And the mysqld.err log will say something like:  050419 11:35:38 [Note] /usr/sbin/mysqld: ready for connections.

It is also possible that this binary or one of the libraries it was linked against is corrupt, improperly built, or misconfigured. This error can also be caused by malfunctioning hardware.

Hash: SHA256

Package        : ruby-openid
Version        : 2.5.0debian-1+deb8u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11027

ruby-openid performed discovery first, and then verification. This allowed an
attacker to change the URL used for discovery and trick the server into
connecting to the URL. This server in turn could be a private server not
publicly accessible.

Furthermore, if the client that uses this library discloses connection errors,
this in turn could disclose information from the private server to the
attacker.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this problem has been fixed in version
2.5.0debian-1+deb8u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-openid packages.

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

# OpenID library for Ruby: Server-Side Request Forgery — GLSA **202003-09**

A vulnerability in OpenID library for Ruby at worst might allow an
attacker to bypass authentication.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-ruby/ruby-openid** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.9.2** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.9.2** |

### Background

A Ruby library for verifying and serving OpenID identities.

### Description

It was discovered that OpenID library for Ruby performed discovery
first, and then verification.

### Impact

A remote attacker could possibly change the URL used for discovery and
trick the server into connecting to the URL. This server in turn could be
a private server not
publicly accessible.

In addition, if the client that uses this library discloses connection
errors, this in turn could disclose information from the private server
to the attacker.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All ruby-openid users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-ruby/ruby-openid-2.9.2"

```

Hi,

I have a question concerning the recent CVE [0]. Could you provide some background which version/commit fixes the issue? Rubygems [1] only shows version 2.7.0. Was version 2.8.0 pulled because of the CVE or was 2.8 just not uploaded by accident ?

Thanks!

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.
