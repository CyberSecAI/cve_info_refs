Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-11620:

**CVE-2019-11620:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Location:** `\doorGets_CMS_V7.0\doorgets\app\requests\user\modulecategoryRequest.php`
*   **Root Cause:** The application directly inserts POST data into a database query without proper sanitization or escaping. Specifically, the `dbQI` function is called, which leads to the `dbVQI` function where unsanitized data is used in SQL queries.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of input sanitization or parameterization for database queries
    *   Direct use of user-provided input in SQL queries, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection
*   **Impact:**
    *   A remote background administrator (or a user with permissions to manage module categories) can exploit this vulnerability to obtain sensitive database information. This could include user credentials, configuration settings, and other critical data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious administrator or authorized user sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable file
    *   The crafted request contains malicious SQL code within the `modulecategory_add_titre` parameter when adding a new module category. The injected SQL is not sanitized, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker must have administrative privileges or permission to manage module categories within the application.

**Technical Details:**

The provided content includes a detailed example of how an attacker can exploit this vulnerability. The steps are:
1.  Log in as an administrator.
2.  Navigate to the module category management page.
3.  Initiate the process of adding a new module category.
4.  Capture the HTTP request using a tool like Burp Suite.
5.  Modify the  `modulecategory_add_titre` parameter in the captured POST request to inject malicious SQL.
6.  Send the modified request to the server.
The server will then execute the injected SQL statement, potentially revealing sensitive information. The example demonstrates injecting a `SELECT USER()` query which then gets displayed.
