Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11403:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that the build cache credentials used to access the cache via HTTP interface were being reflected in the administration screens of both Gradle Enterprise and individual Build Cache Node servers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext credential exposure:** The core vulnerability is the exposure of sensitive credentials (likely username and password or API keys) in a location accessible through the administration interface.
- **Insufficient access control/information disclosure:** The system did not properly sanitize or protect the display of these credentials in administration screens, thus allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers with access to the administration interface can obtain the credentials used for accessing the build cache.
- **Unauthorized Cache Access:** The stolen credentials can be used to read from and potentially write to the build cache, potentially leading to:
    - **Data Breaches:** Exposure of sensitive data contained in the build cache.
    - **Supply Chain Attacks:** Introduction of malicious code or artifacts into the build pipeline via the build cache, resulting in compromised builds.
    - **Denial of Service:** Tampering or corruption of the cache can disrupt the build process for legitimate users.
    - **Lateral Movement:** Depending on the environment, these credentials may allow access to other resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Admin Interface Access:** The primary attack vector is through access to the administrative interface of Gradle Enterprise or the Build Cache Node server. This can be achieved through:
    - **Compromised Admin Accounts:** Exploiting weak credentials or vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism of the administration panel.
    - **Insider Threat:** Malicious actions from an authorized user with admin privileges.
    - **Network Intrusion:** Gaining access to the internal network where the application is hosted and then accessing the admin panels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to gain access to the administrative interface of Gradle Enterprise or a Build Cache Node server.
- This may involve having valid admin credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the login mechanism, or having network access that allows them to reach these interfaces.
- The attacker needs to be able to navigate the admin pages to locate the reflected credentials.
