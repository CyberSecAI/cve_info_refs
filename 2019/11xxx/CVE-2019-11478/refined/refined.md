Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of how it relates to CVE-2019-11478:

**Relevant Content:**

Multiple sources explicitly mention CVE-2019-11478 and provide details about the vulnerability, its cause, impact and mitigation.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Linux kernel processes TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) segments, leading to excessive resource consumption. When a TCP connection uses low Maximum Segment Size (MSS) values, the retransmission queue gets fragmented into tiny skbs inflating memory usage and possibly overflowing 32bit counters. As a result, the Linux kernel's socket buffer (SKB) data structure becomes fragmented, which leads to increased resource utilization to traverse and process these fragments as further SACK segments are received on the same TCP connection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Integer overflow when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgements (SACKs)
*  Excessive resource consumption while processing TCP Selective Acknowledgement (SACK) segments due to fragmented TCP retransmission queue.
*   Excessive resource consumption when handling a TCP connection with low Maximum Segment Size(MSS).

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Remote denial-of-service (DoS) attacks due to kernel crash (SACK Panic), CPU resource exhaustion.
*   System crash due to an integer overflow.
*   Increased bandwidth consumption by a remote attacker forcing the Linux kernel to segment its responses into multiple TCP segments, each of which contains only a small amount of user data.
*    Denial of service-like conditions due to resource exhaustion resulting in reduced performance and delays for legitimate connections.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability via network traffic targeting systems using the TCP protocol.
*   The attack involves sending specifically crafted TCP packets (SACK segments) or establishing TCP connections with low MSS values.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Remote network access to the vulnerable machine.
*   Ability to send crafted TCP packets.
*  In the case of CVE-2019-11479 the attacker must also have the capability to establish TCP connections with low MSS values.

**Additional Details:**

*   Some sources specify that the impact of CVE-2019-11478 leads to resource exhaustion rather than a kernel panic, unless combined with other exploits, such as CVE-2019-11477.
*   Several sources provide a temporary workaround for these vulnerabilities by disabling the TCP SACK option via the command `sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_sack=0` or by dropping packets using iptables or nftables.
*   Some sources provide links to code fixes on GitHub.
