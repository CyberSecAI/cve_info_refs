Package        : libxslt
Version        : 1.1.28-2+deb8u4
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-11068
Debian Bug     : #926895

It was discovered that there was a authentication bypass
vulnerability in libxslt, a widely-used library for transforming
files from XML to other arbitrary format.

The xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite routines permitted access upon
receiving an-1 error code and (as xsltCheckRead returned -1 for a
specially-crafted URL that is not actually invalid) the attacker was
subsequently authenticated.

For Debian 8 "Jessie", this issue has been fixed in libxslt version
1.1.28-2+deb8u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.

Regards,

## Description

![@flavorjones](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8207?u=b696c885624fac0e15405b8713a770e888f26a96&v=4&size=48)[flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones)opened [on Apr 16, 2019](https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1892#issue-433569338)

This issue is to drive investigation and potential action around a set of upstream patches that Canonical judged valuable enough to port to their distributions.

References:

* <https://usn.ubuntu.com/3947-1/>
* <https://usn.ubuntu.com/3947-2/>
* <https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-11068.html>
* <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-11068#vulnCurrentDescriptionTitle>

---

Summary (updated 2019-04-22):

The patch addressing this vulnerability is not yet available in an upstream libxslt release, and so Your Humble Maintainer has cut v1.10.3 of Nokogiri that includes this patch in the vendored library.

---

Interpretation:

To the best of my ([@flavorjones](https://github.com/flavorjones)) understanding of the vulnerability, an application should not be vulnerable unless it is doing both of the following things:

1. explicitly performing XSLT transformations using methods and classes in the Nokogiri::XSLT module
2. **and** doing so using untrusted stylesheets or untrusted documents

If your code is not doing **both** of those things, then I believe you can treat this as a lower priority.

---

History of editing this issue:

* 2019-04-15: issue created
* 2019-04-22: updated with USN/CVE background and note indicating Nokogiri v1.10.3 has been released
* 2019-04-23: added link to NVD entry, and replaced Debian's reported severity with the one in NVD (which Debian points to).
* 2019-04-23: added an interpretation to help guide individual teams' priorities.

# Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2019

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities. These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches. Please refer to:

* [Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) for information about Oracle Security Advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 219 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2019 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2566015.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <http://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2019verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is a unique identifier for a vulnerability. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.0 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.0).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](/corporate/security-practices/assurance/vulnerability/disclosure.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](/support/lifetime-support/). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](/support/policies.html) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Subject: Nokogiri security update v1.10.3

Nokogiri v1.10.3 has been released.

This is a security release. It addresses a CVE in upstream libxslt rated as
"Priority: medium" by Canonical, and "NVD Severity: high" by Debian. More
details are available below.

If you're using your distro's system libraries, rather than Nokogiri's
vendored libraries, there's no security need to upgrade at this time,
though you may want to check with your distro whether they've patched this
(Canonical has patched Ubuntu packages). Note that this patch is not yet
(as of 2019-04-22) in an upstream release of libxslt.

Full details about the security update are available in Github Issue
[#1892][].

  [#1892]: <https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1892>

## 1.10.3 / 2019-04-22

### Security Notes

[MRI] Pulled in upstream patch from libxslt that addresses CVE-2019-11068.
Full details are available in [#1892](
<https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues/1892>). Note that this
patch is not yet (as of 2019-04-22) in an upstream release of libxslt.

CVE-2019-11068

Permalinks are:
- Canonical:
<https://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-11068>
- Debian: <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-11068>

Description:

> libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism
> because callers of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access
> even upon receiving a -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for
> a crafted URL that is not actually invalid and is subsequently
> loaded.

Canonical rates this as "Priority: Medium".

Debian rates this as "NVD Severity: High (attack range: remote)".
