```
{
  "CVE-2019-11068": {
    "Root cause": "The `xsltCheckRead` and `xsltCheckWrite` routines in libxslt permitted access upon receiving a -1 error code. `xsltCheckRead` could return -1 for a crafted URL that was not actually invalid and subsequently loaded.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Authentication bypass",
      "Incorrect error handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker could bypass security checks and potentially access sensitive information. In some scenarios, this could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Specially crafted URLs within XSLT stylesheets"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to supply a specially-crafted URL through an XSLT stylesheet or document, which is then processed using libxslt.  Access to the system is not required."
