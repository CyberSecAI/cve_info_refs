Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11137:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from "Insufficient input validation in system firmware". This means the firmware does not properly check or sanitize inputs it receives, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of input data within the system firmware. This can allow attackers to provide crafted input that the firmware is not designed to handle.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Escalation of Privilege:** An attacker could elevate their privileges on the system, gaining unauthorized access to sensitive resources and functionalities.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability could be exploited to crash or render the system unusable.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could potentially access sensitive information stored within the system or its memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable via local access, implying an attacker would need to have some form of access to the system, whether through physical access or through an existing account on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Privileged User:** The attacker must have privileged user access to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests that the attacker needs to already have some level of administrative or elevated access on the system.
