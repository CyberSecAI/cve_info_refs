- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Event Editor of Synology Calendar.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "title" parameter when creating or editing events, allowing for the injection of arbitrary web script or HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote attacker can inject malicious scripts or HTML into the application. This could lead to various attacks, such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks, depending on the attacker's intent and the context of the injected code within the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the web interface by injecting malicious scripts/HTML via the "title" parameter in the event editor of the Synology Calendar application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a remote authenticated user with the ability to create or modify calendar events in the vulnerable Synology Calendar application.
