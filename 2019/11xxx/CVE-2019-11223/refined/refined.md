Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in SupportCandy:

*   **Vulnerability:** Arbitrary File Upload
*   **Affected Plugin:** SupportCandy
*   **Root Cause:** The plugin contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability due to insecure file upload handling in the file `/includes/admin/tickets/upload_file_rb.php`. This file does not restrict the types of files that can be uploaded. The older functionality in `/includes/admin/tickets/upload_file.php` had some file type restrictions, but the new functionality lacks these checks.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a request to `wp-admin/admin-ajax.php` with the action `wpsc_tickets` and `setting_action` set to `rb_upload_file`.
    *   The file is uploaded to the `/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/` directory. This directory is not created by default, so an attacker must first trigger the secure file upload (`setting_action=upload_file`) to create the directory.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially leading to remote code execution and complete compromise of the website.
*   **Attacker Requirements:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be logged in, as the `tickets` function is accessible to both logged-in and non-logged-in users.
    *   The attacker needs to know the correct parameters to send to `admin-ajax.php`.
    *   The attacker needs to first trigger the creation of the upload directory by using the `upload_file` action.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The AJAX endpoint `wpsc_tickets` calls the `tickets()` function which includes `/includes/admin/tickets/tickets_ajax.php`.
    *   This file uses the `setting_action` parameter to determine which action to take in a switch statement.
    *   Setting `setting_action` to `rb_upload_file` includes the vulnerable file `/includes/admin/tickets/upload_file_rb.php`.
    *   The `/includes/admin/tickets/upload_file_rb.php` file saves the uploaded file to the `/wp-content/uploads/wpsc/` directory without any validation of the file type.
*   **Proof of Concept:** The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to upload arbitrary files using two separate requests. The first request creates the upload directory, and the second request uploads the malicious file.
*   **Mitigation:** Update the SupportCandy plugin to a version that addresses this vulnerability.
*   **More Detail Than CVE:** Yes, the provided content offers a more detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the specific files involved, the attack vector, and a proof of concept.
