Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2019-11191:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how the Linux kernel applies Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) to setuid a.out binaries. Specifically, the `install_exec_creds()` function, responsible for setting up the execution environment, is called too late in the `load_aout_binary()` function within `fs/binfmt_aout.c`. This late call creates a race condition.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:**  A race condition exists in the `load_aout_binary()` function. The kernel maps the executable into memory *before* setting the appropriate execution credentials using install\_exec\_creds.
*   **Insufficient ASLR:** Due to the race condition, an attacker can leverage the `ptrace_may_access()` check within the vulnerable code to observe the memory layout of the setuid program *before* ASLR is applied by reading `/proc/pid/stat`.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **ASLR Bypass:** The primary impact is the circumvention of Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), which is a security mechanism designed to make exploitation harder. By leaking the base addresses of the .text segment and the stack, an attacker gains knowledge of the program's layout, which makes exploiting other vulnerabilities much easier.
*   **Improved Exploitability:** A local attacker can use the leaked addresses to make exploitation more reliable and predictable.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:**  The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the target system.
*   **Race Condition Exploitation:** A local attacker leverages a race condition in the kernel to gain information about memory layout before ASLR takes effect

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker requires a low-privilege local user account on the system.
*   **Ability to execute code:** The attacker needs to be able to run code on the target system.
*   **Ability to execute a setuid program:** The attacker targets setuid binaries that are vulnerable to this issue.
*   **Precise Timing:** Exploitation relies on winning the race condition by reading /proc/pid/stat at the right time, which might require techniques to ensure code execution speed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **a.out format:** The vulnerability affects setuid binaries using the a.out executable format.
*   **Similar to CVE-2019-11190:**  This issue is related to CVE-2019-11190, which affects setuid ELF binaries in a similar way.
*   **Disputed CVE:** The CVE description from MITRE notes that this vulnerability is disputed because ASLR for a.out has never been supported. However, the Linux kernel does indeed attempt to apply ASLR, and this vulnerability prevents this protection from taking effect, highlighting a flaw.
*   **SUSE Advisory:** SUSE classifies the impact of the vulnerability as "Low" severity, which seems contradictory to the potential for exploitation with ASLR bypass.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability can be fixed by either patching the kernel to apply ASLR correctly, or to disabling the vulnerable a.out support. SUSE chose to disable a.out support as a hardening measure.
*   **Code Example:** A Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit code "aslrip.c" is provided, which demonstrates the ability to leak the base address of /bin/su and stack address, confirming the ASLR bypass.
*   **Impact on SUSE products:** SUSE classifies this vulnerability as not affecting SUSE products as they chose to disable a.out support as a hardening measure.
*   **Affects older kernels**: This vulnerability affects Linux kernels before 4.8 (commit 9f834ec18defc369d73ccf9e87a2790bfa05bf46 was not backported)
*   **Affects flat binaries too:** A related issue also affects flat binaries (binfmt_flat.c) - discovered by Dongguangdong of Huawei PSIRT
