Reporter
[Multiple independent researchers](https://mdsattacks.com/#People)
Impact
high
##### Description

If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads.
*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11695: Custom cursor can render over user interface outside of web content](#CVE-2019-11695)

Reporter
bignis
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the addressbar to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the primary web content area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users into clicking on permission prompts, doorhanger notifications, or other buttons inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the user interface.

* [Bug 1445844](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1445844)

#### [#CVE-2019-11696: Java web start .JNLP files are not recognized as executable files for download prompts](#CVE-2019-11696)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Files with the `.JNLP` extension used for "Java web start" applications are not treated as executable content for download prompts even though they can be executed if Java is installed on the local system. This could allow users to mistakenly launch an executable binary locally.

##### References

* [Bug 1392955](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1392955)

#### [#CVE-2019-11697: Pressing key combinations can bypass installation prompt delays and install extensions](#CVE-2019-11697)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If the `ALT` and "a" keys are pressed when users receive an extension installation prompt, the extension will be installed without the install prompt delay that keeps the prompt visible in order for users to accept or decline the installation. A malicious web page could use this with spoofing on the page to trick users into installing a malicious extension.

* [Bug 1440079](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1440079)

#### [#CVE-2019-11698: Theft of user history data through drag and drop of hyperlinks to and from bookmarks](#CVE-2019-11698)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a crafted hyperlink is dragged and dropped to the bookmark bar or sidebar and the resulting bookmark is subsequently dragged and dropped into the web content area, an arbitrary query of a user's browser history can be run and transmitted to the content page via `drop` event data. This allows for the theft of browser history by a malicious site.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.131 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

We can run res:// scheme from Firefox, which allows us to run JavaScript at renderer process privilege (Low IL) in Internet Explorer.

POC:

<script>window.open("res://apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1)", "\_self");</script>

Test on: <https://pwning.click/ffres.php>

Actual results:

Firefox open res:// URL which runs JavaScript at renderer process privilege (Low IL).

Expected results:

Firefox does not allow res:// URL

The summary is generic, but the steps here only highlight the res: protocol on Windows. Are there other protocols you're aware of that need restricting? What do other browsers (esp. other than IE, of course) do?

1. That example runs JavaScript from IE normal protected mode sandbox, which has more attack surface & vulnerable.
2. We are able to run Medium IL JavaScript using IE bug.

Test on: <https://pwning.click/ffres2.php>

For answer to the question, Edge and IE does not allow redirection to res:// scheme. Chrome allows to open res:// but prompts opener which has default on set on "cancel" but not open button. Also, Chrome's URI opener disappears when page is redirected to Cross-Origin site, while Firefox's Launch Application opens normally with default set on "open link" button after Cross-Origin redirection.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Fairly easily
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: Everything
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Trivial - it's just setting a single pref. That pref has been supported since ~forever. We could even hotfix for 66 if we think this is severe enough, but I think it (a) probably isn't and (b) we're releasing 67 soon so I don't think there's a point.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It won't. Knowing the craziness of the internet, there might be complaints that we broke a "convenient" way of launching IE from Firefox. From a quick look, this hole is not abused by extant add-ons on AMO, which use native client APIs to start IE.

Needinfo for Dan to have a chance to consider this, but:

* there's a prompt (however imperfect the prompt is, you filed another bug about that...), and the requirements for user interaction probably constrain the overall severity
* I don't know anything about high/medium/low IL stuff in IE, but if you can escalate what happens in IE (which is what I assume based on [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") which talks about low IL, vs [comment #9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") talking about medium IL) that seems like more of an IE bug than anything else.

I'm worried about enterprises which might use this "feature" in their environments. Given the low severity, I'd probably lean towards not uplifting to ESR unless there's a compelling reason to do so.

> Needinfo for Dan to have a chance to consider this,

In broad strokes this is roughly equivalent to opening a file:/// url in Firefox, which we try hard to prevent. In the file:/// case we simply don't allow it (unless you copy paste into a fresh tab); with res: we have just a prompt between opening it or not, like any other registered URL Handler. Shortcomings in the delay and the "hold down enter" attack on that prompt are already on file, but fair to consider given that MS has apparently blocked res: since IE6 SP1 (from the Internet Zone at least).

The attacker still can't "read" the files, only cause files at known locations to be loaded. There might be an IE exploit, and that's a worry, but it's as likely from a remote web page as a local file. Maybe if you knew/guessed the download folder, and had previously convinced a user to download an .html file, then you could get it to run locally with same-origin access to all the files on disk (you'd still have to convince the user to allow the page's scripts to run). I'm having trouble talking myself into calling this "moderate". Am I missing avenues for taking advantage of this?

The fact that you can escalate the IE sandbox from low to medium is a bug in IE and not relevant to the firefox severity: that part gets you a sec-vector ("someone else's vulnerability") rating.

1. There's a prompt which is default to "Open link", which allow attackers to trick users by just clicking enter. Also, the Launch Application is present even the page is redirected to other sites which could be a potential problem.
2. You gain mandatory Integrity level of Medium when you achieved full Remote Code Execution "with" Sandbox Escape. Which means, attackers are able to run JavaScript and some commands in normal user's privilege - out side of the Sandbox.

More importantly, this is not an IE bug but a bug when "res://" URL is triggered from other applications such like browsers. So this is a bug in all Windows based applications (windows bug). If you try to open the test link in IE, IE blocks res:// URL correctly at AppContainer. So if we run res://ieframe.dll/navcancl.htm#command on other browsers which are not Microsoft Browsers, IE will pop at Medium IL so we are able to run command at Medium IL.

> In broad strokes this is roughly equivalent to opening a file:/// url in Firefox, which we try hard to prevent. In the file:/// case we simply don't allow it (unless you copy paste into a fresh tab); with res: we have just a prompt between opening it or not, like any other registered URL Handler. Shortcomings in the delay and the "hold down enter" attack on that prompt are already on file, but fair to consider given that MS has apparently blocked res: since IE6 SP1 (from the Internet Zone at least).
>
> The attacker still can't "read" the files, only cause files at known locations to be loaded. There might be an IE exploit, and that's a worry, but it's as likely from a remote web page as a local file. Maybe if you knew/guessed the download folder, and had previously convinced a user to download an .html file, then you could get it to run locally with same-origin access to all the files on disk (you'd still have to convince the user to allow the page's scripts to run). I'm having trouble talking myself into calling this "moderate". Am I missing avenues for taking advantage of this?
>
> The fact that you can escalate the IE sandbox from low to medium is a bug in IE and not relevant to the firefox severity: that part gets you a sec-vector ("someone else's vulnerability") rating.

1. I talked about this briefly in previous reply, we are not only able to run file:// url but also other commands and JavaScript. Running arbitrary Medium IL JavaScript is clearly Privilege Escalation, I believe this deserves at least a moderate severity. Yes, "Hold down enter" attack is already on file. The reason I separately reported is because lot's of users will likely be more convinced to run Launch Application without knowing when we use that bug with this.
2. Well, like I stated before at the least attackers are able to run "Medium IL JavaScript" which I believe it's more severe compared to just reading files. Also, "only cause files at known locations to be loaded." is not true. We are able to load any files from unknown locations too. I do have lot's of IE Vulnerabilities, one of them allows to read files from Medium IL so we are able to combinate Medium IL JavaScript attack to read files but like I said before, running Medium IL JavaScript is already severe enough.

And yes, download html files and running html is also a scenario but I think it's not that useful at the point when you can just run Medium IL JS straightforwardly.

Fair enough, I should have said it's a "Microsoft" vulnerability. If `res:` is too dangerous to allow from IE's internet zone it shouldn't be an advertised "URL Protocol" in the system for all apps to use.

> Following example reads chrome.exe from users "without" using IE bug.

You caused the content to open in notepad; the victim is the one reading it. Maybe you can get there if you can open your own content as .html from the local zone, then you could read other files with xhr and post them back to the attack server. Seems reasonably likely that it's possible, but that's not what your example shows.

We are able to disclose OS username using input tag:

We are able to detect the file presence from local zone and AppContainer using onreadystatechange:

<iframe src="res://C%3a%5cProgram Files%5cWindows Media Player%5cwmplayer.exe/24/1" onreadystatechange="count++"></iframe>

<script>

count = 0;

window.onload = function()

if (count == 1) alert("File exists!");

else alert("File does not exist");

We are also able to steal the file from user on local zone and Low IL using hyp3rlinx's XXE bug:

Why does the advisory on FF 67: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-13/#CVE-2019-11700> does not include that this issue could be used for Elevation of Privilege, detecting and reading files from users? I assume the later is not included because it's the bug from IE side but the EoP isn't.

Also, even if the later is the bug from IE side, both file detection and reading files are publicly disclosed.

Which means every attacker could've detect, read files and elevate privilege using this bug and combination of those known bug + OS Username reading bug I shared above to execute automate downloaded html file on C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\exploit.html with no user interaction.

[Awesomebar\_UI\_Mismatch.zip](attachment.cgi?id=9044882) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9044882&action=edit)

I was playing a bit with crafting URIs as I know the parser's a mess and needs to handle many cases of each of the parts of the URIs and found the following (It wasn't replicated on Chrome, Explorer, Edge and Opera):

The Firefox awesomebar doesn't parse well specially crafted URIs and displays for a short time the wrong part of the URI as the domain that the browser is being directed to.

This could lead to phishing scenarios where an attacker will craft a shortened URI for example and put it in the 2nd part of the URI (the domain oculus in this case) while making the victim believe they are being directed to [www.cnn.com](http://www.cnn.com)

As the attacker can control the site, they can control how fast the site will load and the UI will change the marked domain to the read directed domain (if oculus is loading fast enough, you can change the domain to some slow site to see it more clearly)

Other parts of the URI can be leveraged to make it look like the real domain had been accessed, exfiltrate data, and so on.

PoC:

In the POC provided here I just copied and pasted the URI I was using and in this case, the page code has encoded the "\" to %5c%5c, making the real domain in this case [www.cnn.com](http://www.cnn.com)

In Order to see the issue, please copy and paste the URI to the awesomebar.

What are we doing special for "\" vs. "%5c%5c". Both look offhand like it's a userinfo section up to the @www.cnn.com but that's not how we parse the \.

So what happens is that the value:

```
http://foopy:\\blah@somewhere.com//whatever

```

gets "fixed up" by nsIURIFixup / URL parsing to:

```
"http://foopy/blah@somewhere.com//whatever"

```

. This makes the actual host "foopy", not "somewhere.com", and actually fires an http request to "foopy" ("oculus" in [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528939#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Awesomebar UI mismatch could lead to successful phishing of Firefox's users")). When that fails (because at least in my network, there is no such host; note that this will take longer on most Windows systems), because when pasted in the URL bar this is a user-initiated request, we attempt to fix up the request by going to "www.foopy.com" ("www.oculus.com") instead.

Unfortunately, the URL highlighting code still uses regular expressions. Part of the reason for this is that we're trying to do highlighting on the original input, instead of forcing the location bar to display the parsed URL (which would clobber sloppy escaping on the user's part, especially in the path/query string). We can't just use the original URL object for this because the URL parser will strip out gunk that might still be in the location bar (as evidenced here, where `":\\"` has magically become "/"), so any highlighting offsets could be wrong.

This doesn't work well here, because the original input has backslashes in the supposed-username part, which AIUI will cause the "real" URL parser to trash the username part:

<https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#authority-state>

> 2. Otherwise, if one of the following is true
>
> * c is the EOF code point, U+002F (/), U+003F (?), or U+0023 (#)
> * url is special and c is U+005C ()
>
> then:
>
> 1. If @ flag is set and buffer is the empty string, validation error, return failure.
> 2. Decrease pointer by the number of code points in buffer plus one, set buffer to the empty string, and set state to host state.

But the regular expression we use looks like:

```
let matchedURL = url.match(/^(([a-z]+:\/\/)(?:[^\/#?]+@)?)(\S+?)(?::\d+)?\s*(?:[\/#?]|$)/);

```

note in particular that the matching group ending in `"@)?"` only ignores forward slash, question mark and #, and not backslash.

Hence the confusion - the regex thinks this is a valid username portion, and it really isn't.

Now, the obvious/lazy fix is to just add the backslash to both the `[^\/#?]` things and move on.

I don't like living with just that fix.

I'd really like us to move away from this regex, or at least enforce that the regex turns up the same hostname as URI fixup, or enforcing that the URI's `prePath` has to exactly match the initial N bytes in the URL bar (which already strips leading spaces, I think, so just whitespace won't break user input?), otherwise we just clobber the user input for the parsed URL.

Marco, how does that sound to you? Do any of the people currently working on URL bar code have cycles/expertise to take this on?

(In [Cato style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthago_delenda_est), I also think the URL standard isn't very helpful about username/password things. This is what it says about username/passwords:

| Input | Base | Valid | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <https://user:password@example.org/> |  | ❌ | <https://user:password@example.org/> |

Which makes very little sense to me.)

(The reason is that the username/password portion ought not to be used, so it's not valid. But it still works and can be serialized. Similar to </br> not being valid HTML, but also being equivalent to <br>.)

I agree we should not trust the regex to define what's the host.

What about we replace the regex with something like:

```
let {host: domain, userPass, prePath, scheme} = uriInfo.fixedURI;
let fixedPreDomain = prePath.substring(0, prePath.lastIndexOf(domain));
let preDomain = url.substring(0, url.indexOf(domain, fixedPreDomain.length));
let schemeWSlashes = fixedPreDomain.substring(0, fixedPreDomain.lastIndexOf(userPass));

```

This seems like a good idea, yeah.

This looks like it'll need some tweaking when there is no userPass or the userPass is not included in the fixedPreDomain.

Marco, still curious about this. I don't have a lot of cycles right now, unfortunately...

yes, it was mostly pseudocode, it needs some fixes, but we have a good test :)

I'll see if I can take care of this.

The problem is URIFixup may change the host, especially for things like IPv6, for example [1:2:3:4:5:6:255.255.255.255] becomes [1:2:3:4:5:6:ffff:ffff], so we can't just extract parts from the original url using the fixup info. It would just make it harder to find mistakes, but it would not solve all of them.

I think I'll revert to comparing the guessed host with the fixupURI host, if they differ we'll clobber user's input and re-parse.

Hi,

Can you please tell me why this bug is not eligible for a bounty?

As it can be used to phish users.

I could reproduced this issue with an affected Nightly 67.0a1 (2019-02-19) on Windows 10 x64.

On the latest Beta 67.0b8 (Windows 10 x64, Ubuntu 18.04 x64 and macOS 10.13) the entire URI is highlighted, no confusion is created regarding the right domain. Is there something else that I should test here to conclude this issue as verified fixed?

I don't think there's anything else. I'm a bit surprised the entire URI is highlighted, I thought the patch would clobber the input URL and replace it with the "real" one and only highlight the domain in that. Marco?

I'm looking into that, it looks like the patch works properly if quantum bar is enabled, but the url is not highlighted otherwise (so I guess we give up due to some error).

There are 2 problems:

1. the recursion prevention doesn't work because UrlbarSetURI may actually re-enter
2. we must null out userTypedValue, otherwise URLBarSetURI doesn't replace the value

I'm reopening and at this point I think I should add a mochitest-browser.

I'd like the complete fix to be in 67, because the current fix may sometimes cause an infinite recursion that may hang the browser chrome for a few seconds, not a nice experience.

This issue is verified fixed with Nightly 68.0a1 (2019-04-11) on Windows 10 x64, macOS 10.13 and Ubuntu 18.04 x64 (only the real domain is highlighted as expected).

I will modify the 67 flag to affected since the fix has not yet landed there.
