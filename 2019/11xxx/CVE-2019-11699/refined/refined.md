Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Firefox's address bar (also known as the "Awesome Bar") handles and displays specially crafted URIs. Specifically, when a URI contains backslashes within the username/password portion of the URL (e.g., `http://user:\pass\with\backslashes@example.com`), the address bar's highlighting mechanism incorrectly identifies the domain. It uses a regular expression that does not account for backslashes in the user info section, causing it to highlight a different part of the URL as the domain than the actual destination.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Domain Highlighting:** The address bar highlights the wrong portion of the URL as the domain due to the flawed regular expression.
*   **User Confusion:** This mismatch between the displayed domain and the actual domain can mislead users, making them believe they are visiting a different website than the one they are actually being directed to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** Attackers can exploit this to create shortened, crafted URIs that visually appear to direct users to a legitimate domain while actually redirecting them to a malicious site, facilitating phishing attacks.
*   **Spoofing:** This can also result in spoofing attacks where the user believes they are on a different site than they actually are.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URI:** An attacker would need to craft a specific URI containing backslashes in the user info section, which is not a standard part of a normal URL, to trigger this behavior.
*   **User Interaction:** The user would need to paste or click on this malicious URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing backslashes in the user info section.
*   The attacker needs to get the user to either paste the crafted URL into the address bar or click a link containing the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by a mismatch between the URL parsing logic and the highlighting logic within Firefox's address bar.
*   The fix involves ensuring that the highlighted domain matches the actual parsed domain and that URL parsing strips out potentially confusing backslashes.
*  The bug report mentions that other browsers like Chrome, IE, Edge and Opera do not have the same issue.

In summary, CVE-2019-11699 is a low severity spoofing/phishing vulnerability due to a discrepancy between how Firefox parses URLs and highlights the displayed domain, leading to potential user confusion.
