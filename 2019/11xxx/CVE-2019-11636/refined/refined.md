Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11636:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a change introduced in the Zcash Sapling upgrade that increased the maximum transaction size to equal the maximum block size. Prior to Sapling, the maximum transaction size was limited to 100KB. This change, while intended to accommodate larger shielded transactions, inadvertently created an avenue for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Increased Transaction Size Limit:** The core weakness is the increase in the maximum transaction size after the Sapling upgrade. Transactions can now be as large as the maximum block size.
*   **Low Transaction Fee:** The attacker can fill an entire block with a single transaction, paying only a single transaction fee for the block, making the attack relatively cheap.
*   **CPU Intensive Transaction Generation**: The attacker can create large transactions that require significant CPU resources to validate, allowing them to exhaust resources on the node.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial-of-Service:** Attackers can flood the Zcash network with extremely large transactions, filling blocks and preventing normal users from making transactions. This is similar to a Slowloris attack, but instead of HTTP connections, the attack uses large transactions.
*   **Network Disruption:** The DoS attack can severely disrupt the Zcash network, making it unusable for its intended purpose.
*  **Potential for 51% Attack**:  Filling the mempool can lead to node crashes, potentially impacting mining pool operators, and thus significantly drop the hashpower of the network, facilitating a 51% attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Large Transaction Injection:** The primary attack vector is the creation and broadcast of very large transactions that fully utilize the allowed block size, which can be done using reusable Sapling Output proofs.
*  **Network Propagation**: An attacker needs to successfully broadcast the large transaction to the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Computational Resources:** Attackers need sufficient CPU power to generate the large transactions. The more powerful the attacker's CPU, the more efficient the attack.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs the ability to broadcast transactions to the Zcash network.
*   **Minimal Funds:** The attacker needs only enough funds to pay the minimal transaction fee per block to execute the attack.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is referred to as "Sapling Woodchipper" due to its ability to rapidly fill blocks with large transactions.
*   A single-core CPU can potentially flood the network if it can perform ~1000 JoinSplits in less time than the block time of the coin.
*   The vulnerability was introduced by the code change in [Zcash Pull Request 3212](https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/3212) which increased the maximum transaction size post Sapling activation to equal block size.
*   The most effective mitigation is to revert back to the previous 100KB transaction size limit, substantially increasing the cost to attack.

The content also describes a "shadow" fee market, where mining pools prioritize transactions based on their fees, despite the Zcash project's goal of having a flat fee structure. This fee market behavior can impact the effectiveness of the attack based on the fees paid by the attacker.
