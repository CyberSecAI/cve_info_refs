Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the `src_record` parameter in Vtiger CRM version 7.1.0. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89) due to the failure to neutralize special elements in the `src_record` parameter. This allows an attacker to modify the intended SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could lead to:
    *   Reading sensitive data from the database.
    *   Modifying or deleting data in the database.
    *   Potentially gaining shell access to the underlying system by using `os-shell` switch in tools like `sqlmap`.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
*   **`src_record` Parameter:** The specific attack vector is the `src_record` parameter in the Vtiger CRM application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Vtiger CRM.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Vtiger CRM instance.

**Additional Information:**
*   The vulnerability was reported to the Vtiger team on March 21, 2019, and was resolved in hotfix3 released on April 3, 2019.
*   The affected versions include Vtiger CRM 7.1.0 and all prior versions up to and including 7.0.1.
*   The exploit was confirmed by observing the difference in response lengths when injecting single and double quotes.
*   The provided SQL injection example used is `"-3096 union select 100' UNION ALL SELECT version(),NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL -- IJXL"`, to determine the database version.
