Here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2019-11479 from the provided content:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Linux kernel had a hardcoded default Maximum Segment Size (MSS) of 48 bytes.
*   This small MSS value leads to an increased number of fragmented TCP packets.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Consumption:** Processing a high volume of TCP segments with small MSS values consumed excessive system resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
*  **Hardcoded default MSS**: The hardcoded default of 48 bytes was too small and can easily be exploited.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a DoS by sending packets with a very small MSS, leading to high network/CPU overhead, and potentially resource exhaustion.
*  **Fragmented TCP resend queues**: The small MSS allows a remote peer to fragment TCP resend queues significantly more than if a larger MSS were enforced, also leading to a denial of service.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack is launched over a network by a remote peer.
*   **Crafted TCP Segments:**  Attackers send specifically crafted TCP segments that leverage the small MSS value.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** Attackers need network connectivity to the target system.
*   **Packet Manipulation:**  Attackers need the ability to craft TCP packets with a low MSS value

**Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Patching and Mitigations:**  The content highlights various patches, sysctl settings adjustments, and iptables rules to resolve this vulnerability. For example, setting "net.ipv4.tcp\_min\_snd\_mss" sysctl to prevent advertisement of MSS lower than specified, and using firewall rules to block connections with a low MSS.
*   **Specific Affected Products:** The content includes information about specific affected products including, Red Hat, Synology, and Ubuntu, along with their individual remediation instructions.
*   **Timeline:** The content contains mentions of the disclosure timeline and the public announcements.
*  **Workarounds:** Disabling TCP SACK processing and dropping connections with low MSS were provided as workarounds.
*  **Complexity of the exploitation:** The content notes that the exploitation is relatively easy
*   **Linux Kernel Vulnerability:** The content makes clear that this is a flaw within the Linux kernel's networking subsystem, and the fix is in kernel source code.
* **Severity:** The severity is generally rated as "Medium" or "Moderate" for this CVE, although some products assign a higher rating for it.

**In summary,** CVE-2019-11479 describes a vulnerability in the Linux kernel where a hardcoded small default MSS value makes systems susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks. A remote attacker can leverage this vulnerability by forcing systems to process fragmented traffic by setting a small MSS value, thus creating a denial of service condition. Patches, workarounds, and mitigations were widely published.
