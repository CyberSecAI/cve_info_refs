Vendor description:

An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is
highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
An SQL injection vulnerability has been identified in the web "activities API".
An unauthenticated attacker could successfully perform an attack to extract
potentially sensitive information from the database if OpenProject is configured
not to require authentication for API access.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
Requesting the following URL will trigger a time delay as a proof of concept
for exploiting the blind SQL injection:
http://<host>/api/v3/activities/1)%20AND%203281%3d(SELECT%203281%20FROM%20PG_SLEEP(1))%20AND%20(7777%3d7777

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
The vulnerability has been identified in OpenProject version 8.3.1 which
was the most current version at the time of discovery.

According to the vendor all versions between 5.0.0 and 8.3.1 are affected.
Older versions (< 5.0.0) are not vulnerable.

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2019-04-30: Contacting vendor through security () openproject com
2019-04-30: A patch is published in version 8.3.2
2019-05-06: Vendor publishes further details
2019-05-10: Release of security advisory

## What our customers say

OpenProject helped me to visualize my project's timeline and have a better overview. Also, all my team members were able to have access to all project information at any time which reduced the coordination for me.

## What our customers say

I value the flexibility and versatility of OpenProject, we were able to make it fit our own needs. Moreover, the on-premises installation provides us with the required data security.

## What our customers say

OpenProject gives us the opportunity to have a lot of important data in one place. Work package distribution, task scheduling, meeting protocols and additional information are clearly arranged. Therefore no assigned job gets lost in endless lists. It greatly simplifies the organization of our project and thus helps us to work more efficiently together on our CubeSat SOURCE.

## What our customers say

Last year, we introduced OpenProject in our non-profit project "fLotte Berlin" to organize all the tasks related to the operation of 250 cargo bikes that can be borrowed free of charge. Since then, the communication effort in our team has decreased significantly, our response times have improved noticeably and the processes have become more structured and transparent. During the introductory phase, OpenProject provided us with amazing support. Thank you again!
