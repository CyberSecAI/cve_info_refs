Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the streaming server provided by HiSilicon in HI3516 models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Buffer overflow: A specially crafted RTSP over HTTP packet sent during the authentication stage can cause a buffer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An unauthenticated attacker can remotely execute arbitrary root code on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malicious RTSP over HTTP packet during the authentication phase of the protocol.
- The vulnerability is reachable over the network without requiring authentication

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The content lists several affected camera models from TENVIS, FDT, FOSCAM and Dericam. It also implies that other cameras using HiSilicon products are potentially vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is located in the streaming server software provided by Hisilicon and is likely a result of improper input validation or handling of RTSP packets.
