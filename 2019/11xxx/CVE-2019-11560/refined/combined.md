|  | ############### DESCRIPTION ################### |
| --- | --- |
|  | A buffer overflow vulnerability in the streaming server provided by |
|  | hisilicon in HI3516 models allows an unauthenticated attacker to |
|  | remotely run arbitrary root code by sending a special RTSP over HTTP |
|  | packet during the authentication stage in the protocol. |
|  |  |
|  | ############# AFFECTED PRODUCTS ############### |
|  | The vulnerability was found in many cameras using hisilicon's |
|  | hardware and software, as demonstrated by: |
|  |  |
|  | TENVIS cameras 1.3.3.3, 1.2.7.2, 1.2.1.4, 7.1.20.1.2, and 13.1.1.1.7.2; |
|  |  |
|  | FDT FD7902 11.3.14.1.3 and 10.3.14.1.3; |
|  |  |
|  | FOSCAM cameras 3.2.1.1.1\_0815 and 3.2.2.2.1\_0815; |
|  |  |
|  | Dericam cameras V11.3.8.1.12. |
|  |  |
|  | The vulnerability was found in many cameras using hisilicon's |
|  | hardware and software and in high probability is also found in cameras |
|  | that are not listed in the above list (but still use hisilicon's products). |
