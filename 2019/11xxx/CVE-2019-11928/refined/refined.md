- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An input validation issue in WhatsApp Desktop versions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute when a user clicks on a specially crafted link within a live location message. This could potentially lead to session hijacking, information theft, or other malicious actions within the context of the user's WhatsApp session.
- **Attack vectors**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious live location message that contains a link with specially crafted code. This message then has to be received and the malicious link clicked by the target user in the WhatsApp Desktop application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a message to the target user and have the user click the malicious link in the live location message.
