- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of path filtering when downloading files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file download vulnerability. The application does not sanitize or validate the file paths provided by the user, allowing them to download any file accessible to the web server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can download sensitive system files, leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the `download` parameter in the `/admin/db_backup` endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (as the description mentions 'normal users' are affected) and able to access the vulnerable endpoint.

The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (PoC) URL demonstrating the vulnerability:
`http://192.168.1.112/gila-1.10.1/admin/db_backup?download=/etc/passwd`
This confirms the ability to download arbitrary files, in this example the `/etc/passwd` file.
