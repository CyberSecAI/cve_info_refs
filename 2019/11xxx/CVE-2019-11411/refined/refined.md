{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `numtostr` function in `jsnumber.c` uses a fixed-size buffer of 32 bytes to format floating-point numbers into strings. For certain large numbers, the formatted string exceeds this buffer size, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "A stack-based buffer overflow can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the application. It also has the potential for arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted, although this is not explicitly stated in the provided text.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By providing crafted JavaScript code that uses the `Number#toFixed()` method (or similar functions which use `numtostr`) with very large numbers."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code using the vulnerable `mujs` interpreter. This might involve embedding malicious JavaScript in a webpage, or providing the code via another method if `mujs` is used as part of an embedded scripting engine.",
     "cve": "CVE-2019-11411"
  }
