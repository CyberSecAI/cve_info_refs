Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11694:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incorrect return value in the `FileSystemPolicy::OpenFileAction` function within the Firefox sandbox on Windows. When a file access is denied, the function incorrectly returns `true` instead of `false`, causing the `FilesystemDispatcher::NtOpenFile` to proceed and write an uninitialized handle to the shared memory, leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the leakage of uninitialized stack memory, specifically a handle value, from the broker process to the renderer process.
*   **Incorrect Return Value:** The `OpenFileAction` function incorrectly returns `true` on a denied access, which is the root cause of the issue.
*   **Uninitialized Variable:** The handle variable is not initialized before being written to the shared memory, resulting in the leakage of data.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Memory Leakage:** An attacker can leak potentially sensitive data from the broker process's stack. This can include function pointers, return addresses, or other stack-allocated data.
*   **Sandbox Escape Prerequisite**: While the vulnerability itself doesn't provide sandbox escape, it could be a component in a broader attack chain that enables a sandbox escape when combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crosscall:** The vulnerability is triggered via a `NtOpenFile` crosscall, where a renderer process requests the broker process to open a file.
*  **File access denial**: The bug is triggered when the file access is denied according to the sandbox policy.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Compromised Renderer Process:** An attacker needs to have achieved code execution within a sandboxed renderer process to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to control crosscall parameters**: The attacker needs to be able to control the parameters passed to the `NtOpenFile` crosscall. This includes the file path, attributes, and access masks
*   **Access to shared memory**: The attacker needs to be able to read the shared memory region in order to obtain the leaked data.

**Additional details:**

*   The bug is specific to the Windows implementation of the sandbox and affects both x86 and x64 builds.
*   The vulnerability exists due to a missed patch from the Chromium project, where a similar issue was fixed earlier.
*   The bug can be triggered by requesting an `NtOpenFile` crosscall to a path which access would be denied by the sandbox policy.
*   The leaked handle value depends on the path parameter. When the filename length is large, stack allocation in `GetParameterStr` will cause the handle to leak the filename string length. When the filename is smaller than 7 characters, the return address of a `memmove` call will be leaked.
*   A similar vulnerability was found in the `NtOpenKey` dispatcher with the same root cause.
*   The provided report included a DLL that can be injected for testing purposes.
*   The fix involves correcting the return value of the `OpenFileAction` and initializing the handle variable, preventing the leak.
*  The vulnerability was reported by Jeremy Fetiveau of SSD Secure Disclosure.
*   The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity by Mozilla.
