- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application logs user-controlled input from headers or form elements into log files without proper sanitization.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Log poisoning vulnerability, lack of input sanitization
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker can inject malicious payloads into log files. These payloads can then be executed via a client-side debugging console and the Java Bean that is available to the deployed application, leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote, authenticated attackers can inject payloads by entering malicious payloads in either headers or form elements.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the OneShield Policy (Dragon) framework and have network access to the application. The debugging console and Java Bean must also be available.
