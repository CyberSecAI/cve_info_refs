- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `ViewLogging` class in Jira exposed various resources that were vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers could modify various settings through CSRF attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), where an attacker crafts a malicious request that is then executed by a logged-in user's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to induce a logged-in user to unknowingly send a crafted request to the vulnerable Jira instance. This could involve a malicious website or email.
