Fixing HPACK header table resize issue

```
Summary: On resizing the header table down and then up again, a resize can be called against the underlying vector that actually sizes it down.  This causes a lot of things to break as the code that does the resizing assumes the underlying vector is only ever resized up.

# CVE-2019-11940

**Description:**  In the course of decompressing HPACK inside the HTTP2 protocol, an unexpected sequence of header table resize operations can place the header table into a corrupted state, leading to a use-after-free condition and undefined behavior. **Affected Versions:** This issue affects Proxygen from v0.29.0 until v2017.04.03.00. **References:**
