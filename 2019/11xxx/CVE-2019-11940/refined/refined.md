Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11940:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of header table resize operations in the HPACK decompression implementation within the Proxygen library. Specifically, when the header table is resized down and then up again, a resize operation could be called on the underlying vector that effectively reduces the vector's size. This is problematic because the resizing logic assumes the underlying vector is only ever resized upwards (increased in size), leading to inconsistencies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Resize Logic:** The code does not properly account for the possibility of resizing the underlying data structure (vector) to a smaller size.
*   **Use-After-Free:** The incorrect resizing can lead to a state where memory is accessed after it has been freed, causing a use-after-free condition.
*   **Undefined Behavior:** The use-after-free condition results in undefined behavior, which can manifest as crashes, unexpected program behavior, or potentially other security issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashes due to the use-after-free condition could lead to denial of service.
*   **Unspecified impacts:** The undefined behavior could potentially be leveraged for other attacks, though this is not specifically detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP/2 HPACK Decompression:** The vulnerability occurs during the decompression of HPACK headers within the HTTP/2 protocol.
*   **Header Table Manipulation:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted sequences of header table resize operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP/2 requests to a server using the vulnerable version of Proxygen.
*   **Knowledge of HPACK:** The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of how HPACK header compression works, specifically the header table resize operations, to craft a malicious sequence.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is located in `proxygen/lib/http/codec/compress/HeaderTable.cpp`.
*   The fix involves ensuring the resize operation correctly handles cases where the table is being resized to a smaller capacity, and also handles the scenario where a resize might cause wrapped data to be moved within the internal buffer.
*   The vulnerable code is present in Proxygen versions v0.29.0 until v2017.04.03.00.
*   The provided GitHub commit (`f43b134cc5c19d8532e7fb670a1c02e85f7a8d4f`) contains the fix for the vulnerability.
