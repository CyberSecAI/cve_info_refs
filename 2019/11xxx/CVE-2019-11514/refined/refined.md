The provided content relates to CVE-2019-11514.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability was due to the fact that email confirmation tokens were not being invalidated after a user's email was confirmed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The system allowed multiple email confirmation tokens to exist for a single user. If a user requested multiple email confirmations, each token would have allowed an email to be confirmed for the user, even after one had already been used to successfully confirm the email. This could be exploited if an attacker gained access to an old, unused email confirmation token, because they could then use it to gain control of the account.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with a valid, but unused email confirmation token, could take over the account of the intended user.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could gain access to an old email confirmation token through various means including intercepting emails or by gaining access to a user's email inbox.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs access to a valid email confirmation token that was generated for the target user but was not yet used.
