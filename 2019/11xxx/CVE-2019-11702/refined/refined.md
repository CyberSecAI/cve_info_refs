Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of mitigation in Firefox when handling external protocol executions, specifically those associated with Internet Explorer (IE) such as `IE.HTTP:`. These protocols can be used to launch IE, which can then be exploited using known `res:` protocol vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **External protocol execution:** Firefox does not properly restrict the execution of external protocols, allowing IE protocols to be triggered.
- **Abuse of IE protocols:** The `IE.HTTP:` protocol could be used to open local files at a known location by launching IE which is vulnerable to `res:` protocol issues.
- **Lack of sufficient dialog protection:** While a dialog prompts the user before executing the protocol, it can be bypassed by holding down the Enter key or repeatedly clicking, if the user is tricked to click where the dialog appears.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary local file access:** An attacker could trick the user to open local files using IE.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Once a local file is opened, it can be used in other attacks, like executing javascript as seen in the example `IE.[HTTP:res://apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1](http:///res%3A//apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1))`.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious hyperlinks:** The vulnerability can be exploited by using specially crafted hyperlinks containing `IE.HTTP:` or similar IE based protocols.
- **Social Engineering:** Attacker needs to trick user into clicking on such link and also bypass the dialog which opens to confirm the execution of the external protocol.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to deliver a malicious link:** An attacker must be able to deliver a malicious link containing the `IE.HTTP:` or similar protocols.
- **User interaction:** The user must click the link and approve execution of the protocol in the dialog.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue is specific to Windows, other OS are unaffected.
- The fix involves disabling the `IE.HTTP:`, `iehistory` and `ierss` protocols in Firefox and changing the dialog's default focus to 'Cancel' and prolong the delay when the dialog is triggered by repeated key presses.
- The vulnerability is similar to a previously fixed bug, [bug 1549833](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833), but uses `IE.HTTP:` protocol, making it a variation of the original problem.
