|  | |

+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of [Bug #1549833](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") +++

Essentially the same as [bug 1549833](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)"), except you can launch IE with the IE.HTTP: scheme. Example:

IE.[HTTP:res://apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1](http:///res%3A//apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1))

IE.HTTP: sends the string to IE, and then all the res: payloads from the other bugs work again.

I don't know if there are more IE aliases, but there are a *lot* of URL Protocols that look at least somewhat risky. Maybe while we're here we can change the default button the external handler dialog to "Cancel" to at least make it a little harder to do by accident (e.g. holding down enter). Could also double the button disable delay -- it's really fast.<

Sorry, Gijs, here's one.

Pascal: if we just pref-flip IE.HTTP like the patch in [bug 1549833](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") is there any chance to get this into Firefox 67 or a ridealong 67.0.x? Once we release an advisory for the other bug people will start looking and this isn't that hard to find.

It should be the same as other dialogs, from pref `security.dialog_enable_delay`. Is it not, in practice?

Also, how deep does this rabbithole go - in my win10 machine, there's also IE.FTP and IE.HTTPS, but they're not marked as URL protocols. There's also `iehistory` and `ierss` which *are* marked as URL protocols but don't seem to "work" as they don't have an associated app (at least on the 1 system where I checked this).

As a ridealong for a 67 dot release (not the trailhead one), yes, but for 67.0 it's too late.

So the delay is 1s, decided on in [bug 916726](/show_bug.cgi?id=916726 "RESOLVED FIXED - Download \"open file\" dialog delay is too quick, doesn't prevent clickjacking") . It was 2s before, but that was deemed too long, so I'm not really inclined to increase the timeout for all dialogs. We could separate the timeout for this dialog from the default, if that was deemed necessary.

I'm attaching 1 patch that:

* blocks ie.http (but not ie.https/ie.ftp which don't seem to be protocols on my machine?)
* blocks iehistory/ierss (despite not having an association on my machine - they just look dodgy)

and another patch that prolongs the 1s timeout from repeated keydown events (this affects all users of the EnableDelayHelper class), and moves the acceptance of this specific dialog away from an "accept" button (so enter doesn't trigger it in the first place).

There's still a potential for accepting the dialog if you encourage users to mouseclick somewhere, though that'd require being able to predict the positioning of the dialog and the buttons which seems much more error prone, and keeping them clicking for >=1s after the dialog has appeared. I don't know if that's enough to justify changing the delays here. If so please let me know.

It is the same. Felt fast but maybe I was just having a slow day.

Agreed that iehistory/ierss looked dodgy, but I couldn't make them do anything so left them off. At first glance you'd assume IE.HTTPS and IE.FTP work like IE.HTTP, but we no longer recognize them from Firefox thanks to [bug 1527717](/show_bug.cgi?id=1527717 "RESOLVED FIXED - Windows programs that aren't \"URL Handlers\" exposed to web content").

> There's still a potential for accepting the dialog if you encourage users to mouseclick somewhere [....] I don't know if that's enough to justify changing the delays here.

The delay is more than enough for it's original purpose of preventing surprise clicks by popping the prompt up under the spot where you've trained/lured a user to click. They're looking at the spot and will see the dialog appear and can react. The "hold a key down" attack is harder to prevent because the attacker can get a user to focus somewhere away from where the dialog pops up so they might not let up in time. Time delay isn't the fix for that. For that we should change the default focus to Cancel, and make sure we don't have a Hot Key for the dangerous button.

I'm waiting at least a little bit before requesting uplift to 68 because I'm a little worried about regressions - there don't seem to be any automated tests covering this code... Though if we want this for a ride-along I should probably take timing of 67.0.5 into account. Worst case we could only block the extra protocols and have the changes to the dialog ride with 68.

Pascal, what's the timeline for 67.0.5 / dot releases?

> Pascal, what's the timeline for 67.0.5 / dot releases?

67.0.5 (Trailhead) ships on June 4. Note that 67.0.5 is a placeholder version for the Trailhead release, it's likely to be called 67.0.1 or 67.0.2 if we have a dot release before. We don't take ride alongs in the Trailhead release, we know that we will have a non-trailhead dot release but at the moment, one day after shipping 67, we don't have a strong driver for a dot release in the days to come.

Flags: needinfo?(pascalc)

[Bug 1552627](/show_bug.cgi?id=1552627 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") - r?dveditz

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: Security risks
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: No
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: No
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: I will attach 2 testcases with instructions.
* **List of other uplifts needed**: n/a
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: For beta, I think this is low-risk. We have a lot of beta runway, the changes are relatively straightforward and all frontend-only, and beta will help flush out regressions -- the protocol dialog doesn't really come up every day and the nightly population is much smaller. The worst thing that could happen is inadvertent breakage of time-delay'd dialogs/notifications.
* **String changes made/needed**: nope

[Testcase 1](attachment.cgi?id=9066998) (obsolete)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9066998&action=edit)

This is the simplest testcase.

Pre-patch: opening this testcase shows a dialog on Windows that offers to open Internet Explorer. It will likely do nothing or show an error page on mac/linux.

Expected post-patch: opening the testcase shows a blank or error page (no more dialog to open IE.

Attached file
[Testcase 2](attachment.cgi?id=9067000)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9067000&action=edit)

OK, second testcase...

Open this, use the keyboard to focus the button (ie use Tab key; on mac you may need to turn on "full keyboard access" in the system preferences), then hold down enter

Pre-patch: the dialog to open the telnet link will come up, and after some 1s delay, the selected application will open (for me, this is Terminal on Mac, and "Internet shortcut shell extension dll" on Windows 10 - I've not tested Linux, it's possible there's no protocol handler there, in which case, ignore Linux)

Post-patch, expected: the dialog will open, but the selected application will not open by just holding down enter - the "Open Link" button will remain disabled until shortly after you stop holding down enter.

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also

It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
