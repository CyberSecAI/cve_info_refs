- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The installer for Intel(R) SCS Discovery Utility uses an unquoted service path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted service path in the installer.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An authenticated user can potentially escalate privileges via local access.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with local access to the system. The attacker must also be able to leverage the unquoted service path vulnerability which requires some level of access and knowledge.
