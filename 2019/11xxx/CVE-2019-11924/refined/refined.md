Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11924:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Fizz library handled handshake fragments. Specifically, it did not properly reject zero-length handshake records that consisted only of padding. This allowed an attacker to send multiple records with only padding, causing the server to store the padding in memory without processing it, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Handling of Zero-Length Handshake Records:** The core issue was the failure to reject handshake records that contained no actual handshake data, only padding.
*   **Memory Exhaustion:** The system would indefinitely accumulate padding data, leading to excessive memory consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending numerous zero-length handshake records, an attacker could exhaust the server's memory, rendering it unable to process legitimate requests, effectively causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TLS records with zero-length handshake messages over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable server to send the malicious handshake records.
*   **TLS Handshake Initiation:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate a TLS handshake with the vulnerable server, but doesn't necessarily need to complete it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was introduced in version `v2019.01.28.00` of Fizz and was fixed in `v2019.08.05.00`.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in commit [`6bf6713`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fizz/commit/6bf67137ef1ee5cd70c842b014c322b7deaf994b), which rejects zero-length handshake records, and commit [`3eaddb3`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/fizz/commit/3eaddb33619eaaf74a760872850c550ad8f5c52f) which coalesces handshake messages into a contiguous buffer to avoid excessive memory consumption.

This analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability and how it can be exploited.
