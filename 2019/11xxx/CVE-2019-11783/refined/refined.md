- The vulnerability stems from a programming error in the Odoo mail module, specifically how channel partners are handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control: The mail module in Odoo Community and Enterprise editions (versions 14.0 and earlier) does not properly restrict access to private mail channels. This allows unauthorized users to subscribe to private channels without invitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized Access: A malicious user with portal access can join private channels without being invited.
- Confidentiality Breach: Once subscribed, the attacker can read past private discussions and receive future notifications, leading to a breach of confidentiality.
- Potential Information Exposure: Sensitive information shared within the private channels may be exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network Exploitable: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over a network.
- Specially crafted request: The attacker needs to send a specially crafted request to join the private channels.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated User: The attacker must have a valid user account, specifically one with portal access.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the Odoo instance.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in both Odoo Community and Enterprise Editions.
- The vulnerability is located in the "Discuss" application component.
- Patches are available for Odoo versions 11.0, 12.0, 13.0, and 14.0
