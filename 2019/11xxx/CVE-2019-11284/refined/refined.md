- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Reactor Netty versions prior to 0.8.11 pass headers, including authorization headers, through redirects.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of headers during redirects. Specifically, sensitive headers like authorization headers are forwarded to different servers during redirects.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can gain access to credentials intended for a different server by exploiting this vulnerability. This allows them to potentially impersonate or gain unauthorized access to resources on the target server.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves a malicious user initiating a request that results in a redirect. The vulnerable application will pass authorization headers intended for the initial server to the redirect target, potentially exposing credentials to the attacker's controlled server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate requests that cause redirects from the vulnerable server and have control over the server to which the redirect is sent. They also do not need to be authenticated to carry out the attack.
