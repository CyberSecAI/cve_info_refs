Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11528:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The system path `/usr/local/bin` had file mode `2777` (drwxrwsrwx). This grants write access to all users, including non-privileged users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Insecure file permissions on `/usr/local/bin` allowing any user to write to it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can write malicious executable files to `/usr/local/bin`. This can be used to stage a payload for later execution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An unprivileged user can write executable files into `/usr/local/bin`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Any user with access to the system, even non-privileged, can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
- A proof of concept is provided using a `curl` command, which leverages the insecure file permissions to inject commands.
- A timeline of the discovery, reporting, and patching process is included.
- The vulnerable product is uaGate SI from Softing.
- A fix was implemented in Firmware version 1.71.00.1225.
