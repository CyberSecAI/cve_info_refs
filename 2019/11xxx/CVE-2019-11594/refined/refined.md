Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11594:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `$rewrite` filter option introduced in some ad-blocking extensions (Adblock Plus, AdBlock, and uBlock). This option allows filter list maintainers to redirect network requests. While intended for benign purposes like removing tracking data or blocking ads, it can be abused to redirect requests to arbitrary origins under specific circumstances, enabling code injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Unrestricted `$rewrite`:** The primary weakness is the ability of the `$rewrite` filter option to redirect requests, even to locations that could serve malicious code. Although the feature was intended to be used for resources of the same origin, it was possible to redirect requests to different origins when specific circumstances are met.
*   **Lack of Origin Validation:** Web services that fetch and execute code via XMLHttpRequest or Fetch, without properly validating the origin or final request URL, are susceptible to this exploit. They do not restrict from which origins code can be fetched using Content Security Policy (CSP).
*   **Server-Side Open Redirects:** The existence of server-side open redirects on the target origin could be exploited to redirect a request to an arbitrary location, which can then host malicious code.
*   **Trust in Filter List Maintainers:** The vulnerability relies on the assumption that filter list maintainers are trustworthy, which is not always the case. A malicious or compromised filter list can introduce malicious rewrite rules to a large user base.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable web service, such as Google Maps, Gmail or Google Images.
*   **Data Theft/Manipulation:** By executing code, attackers could steal user data, manipulate the displayed content, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The injected code could potentially be used to install malware on a user's system, or further compromise it.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Filter List:** A malicious actor could control filter lists to deliver specific rewrite rules to targeted users, or to the entire user base of the adblocking extension.
*   **Compromised Filter Lists:** Legitimate filter list maintainers could be compromised, which allows attackers to inject malicious rules into existing, trusted lists.
*   **Targeted Attacks:** Attacks could be targeted to users based on their IP address, by sending a malicious filter list only to the targeted IP, while keeping the public filter list intact.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Control over Filter Lists:** Attackers need to be able to modify or control filter lists used by the vulnerable ad-blocking extensions.
*   **Vulnerable Web Service:** A target web service must fetch and execute code using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch without proper origin validation, have an open redirect, or host arbitrary user content.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Extensions:** Attackers must be aware of which ad blocking extensions are vulnerable and how to create the malicious `$rewrite` rule.

**Additional notes:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Adblock Plus (3.2 to 3.5.1), AdBlock (3.32.0 to 3.44.0), and uBlock (0.9.5.11 to 0.9.5.14)
*   uBlock Origin was not vulnerable, as its maintainer had rejected this feature due to security and performance concerns.
*   The exploit is a chain of multiple vulnerabilities, and Google considered it "intended behavior" rather than a bug in their web services.
*   Mitigation includes using the `connect-src` CSP header, eliminating server-side open redirects, and dropping support for the `$rewrite` filter option.
