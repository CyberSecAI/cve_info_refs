{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The password reset process in MKCMS V5.0 has a flaw. The system resets the password to a known value (md5 of '123456') upon a password reset request, and then sends the reset link via email, making it easy for attackers to take over accounts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Predictable password reset",
    "Lack of secure password reset procedure"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can take over any user account by simply knowing their username and initiating a password reset. After that, they can log in with the known password and gain complete access to the account.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by sending a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `ucenter/repass.php` with the target username. A simple HTML form is sufficient to exploit this vulnerability.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to know a valid username on the system and have the ability to send a POST request to the server."
