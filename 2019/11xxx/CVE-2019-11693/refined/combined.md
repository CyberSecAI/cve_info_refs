List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors

| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Attached file
[1.html](attachment.cgi?id=9048397)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9048397&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/72.0.3626.119 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

void WebGLBuffer::BufferData(GLenum target, size\_t size, const void\* data,

GLenum usage) {

// Careful: data.Length() could conceivably be any uint32\_t, but GLsizeiptr

// is like intptr\_t.

if (!CheckedInt<GLsizeiptr>(size).isValid())

return mContext->ErrorOutOfMemory("bad size");

if (!ValidateBufferUsageEnum(mContext, usage)) return;

#ifdef XP\_MACOSX

// [bug 790879](/show_bug.cgi?id=790879 "RESOLVED FIXED - integer overflow, invalid write w/webgl bufferdata")

if (mContext->gl->WorkAroundDriverBugs() && size > INT32\_MAX) {

mContext->ErrorOutOfMemory("Allocation size too large.");

return;

}

#endif

const void\* uploadData = data;

UniqueBuffer newIndexCache;

if (target == LOCAL\_GL\_ELEMENT\_ARRAY\_BUFFER &&

mContext->mNeedsIndexValidation) {

newIndexCache = malloc(size);

if (!newIndexCache) {

mContext->ErrorOutOfMemory("Failed to alloc index cache.");

return;

}

memcpy(newIndexCache.get(), data, size);

uploadData = newIndexCache.get();

}

The bufferdata function does not have an appropriate check for size value.

This coulde cause problems in the attached code.

I think it's almost impossible to exploit, but I think it's a security issue. :)

I'm not seeing the bug you're hitting in ASAN, except if it's a driver bug. I do see one frame of driver call in the asan stack, so that's possible.

In particular, this keeps everything here safe:

```
if (!CheckedInt<GLsizeiptr>(size).isValid())
  return mContext->ErrorOutOfMemory("bad size");

```

This will error out if `size_t size` is too large for GLsizeiptr. (size\_t is unsigned, so it can never be too small)

So what do you think is the root cause of the bug?

I didn't see that properly code, but I knew for sure that oom occurred when i use bufferdata function.

There's definitely issues here on 32bit builds, but I think on 64bit we should be doing everything correctly on our end. There's a chance the driver has a bug here though.

FWIW, WebGLintptr and WebGLsizeiptr are both int64\_t, while GLintptr and GLsizeiptr are equivalent to intptr\_t, which is int64\_t on 64bit, but int32\_t on 32bit. size\_t is naturally uint64\_t on 64bit, uint32\_t on 32bit.

There is also an issue with handling GL\_OUT\_OF\_MEMORY resulting from the glBufferData call, but I don't see how the POC could trigger it.

the reason why i can say this is oom that i tested poc code on ubuntu and confirmed oom through dmesg.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
critical
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Bogdan Tara, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jan Varga, Gary Kwong, Tim Guan-tin Chien, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, and Ted Campbell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66 and Firefox ESR 60.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

The use and free stacks are almost the same, starting at mozilla::dom::WakeLock::Release() (the second one in the case of the free stack)

Maybe the use stack is calling EventListenerManager::RemoveAllListeners() on the same ELM and listener that is having EventListenerManager::RemoveEventListenerByType() called on it in the free stack? It is an observer array, so it is supposed to be able to deal with at least some reentrance, but it looks like nsTArray\_Impl::RemoveElementsAtUnsafe() calls destroy on the elements before it removes them from the array, so I think you could end up calling the dtor on an object twice.

There are other places in ELM that remove things from mListeners, which feel like they could also be affected, so maybe it isn't actually a regression.

The issue is when we explicitly remove all the listeners. That changed recently.

(there can be other similar cases. looking)

Actually, UnlinkSelf is odd. It calls Release and only then clears mPtrBits.

Changing that should be enough to fix this, since RemoveEventListenerByType would become no-op.

If esr60 is affected I guess that means 1489308 isn't actually the cause for this?

[Bug 1489308](/show_bug.cgi?id=1489308 "RESOLVED FIXED - Align document.open() with overhauled spec") added a way this could be reached, but there might have been other ways it could be reached too.

That said, I don't understand why ~WakeLock calls WakeLock::DetachEventListener(). If it's still an event listener on some event target, that will hold a ref to it and hence ~WakeLock won't get reached, right? Can we just remove that call (in a separate bug)?

WakeLock is the event listener, and when it's refcnt drops to 0 because ELM's listener are removed, its dtor is called (synchronously since it isn't CCable object), and then dtor tries to re-remove the listener.

|  | |

Right, but why is the dtor trying to remove anything? If it's registered as a listener, the ELM will hold a ref and its refcnt can't drop to 0. So if the dtor is running, there's no need to do any removals, unless I'm missing something.

oh, sure, dtor doesn't need to remove anything. But if one tries to do that, it shouldn't crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9815: Disable hyperthreading on content JavaScript threads on macOS](#CVE-2019-9815)

Reporter
[Multiple independent researchers](https://mdsattacks.com/#People)
Impact
high
##### Description

If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads.
*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

Impact
high
##### Description

A possible vulnerability exists where type confusion can occur when manipulating JavaScript objects in object groups, allowing for the bypassing of security checks within these groups.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Olli Pettay, Bogdan Tara, Jan de Mooij, Jason Kratzer, Jan Varga, Gary Kwong, Tim Guan-tin Chien, Tyson Smith, Ronald Crane, and Ted Campbell reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66, Firefox ESR 60.6, and Thunderbird 60.6. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

##### Description

If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads.
*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Andrei Ciure, Julien Cristau, Jan de Mooij, Jan Varga, Marcia Knous, André Bargull, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
