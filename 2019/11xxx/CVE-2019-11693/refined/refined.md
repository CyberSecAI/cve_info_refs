{
  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2019-11693",
    "description": "The `bufferdata` function in WebGL is vulnerable to a buffer overflow with specific graphics drivers on Linux. This could result in malicious content freezing a tab or triggering a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "root_cause": "The `WebGLBuffer::BufferData` function did not have an appropriate check for the size value, leading to a potential integer overflow when converting a `size_t` to a `GLsizeiptr` and also to potential heap overflow due to driver specific size handling.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious content could freeze a tab or trigger a potentially exploitable crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious website using WebGL can call the vulnerable `bufferdata` function with a large size parameter.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript in the context of a vulnerable browser and have knowledge of the specific vulnerable graphics driver on Linux."
