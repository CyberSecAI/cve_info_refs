The provided content relates to **CVE-2019-11449**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `$notes` parameter from the database query is not sanitized before being displayed on the `notes.php` page.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `$notes` parameter, which will be stored in the database.
- When other users view the `notes.php` page, the malicious script will be executed in their browsers, allowing the attacker to perform actions on their behalf, such as stealing session cookies, redirecting the user, or performing other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker can send a POST request to `notes.php` with a crafted `notes` parameter containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the `notes.php` endpoint with a valid `PHPSESSID`. They would also need knowledge of the vulnerable parameter, in this case `notes`.
- The attacker needs to be able to log in and have a valid session ID.
