Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-11770:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Eclipse Buildship project was resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This allowed for a potential man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure dependency resolution:** Using HTTP for dependency downloads exposed the process to MITM attacks.
- **Lack of checksum verification:** The downloaded Eclipse SDK did not have checksum verification, making it easier for a compromised artifact to go undetected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Compromised build artifacts:** Maliciously modified dependencies could infect the build artifacts produced by the Buildship project.
- **Developer infection:** Developers using compromised dependencies could be infected, and this infection could persist even after updating to fix the vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks:** An attacker intercepting the HTTP traffic during dependency downloads could inject malicious code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the developer and the HTTP servers hosting the dependencies.
- **MITM capability:**  The attacker needs to be able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Additional Details from the Content:**
- The vulnerability is associated with CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere.
- The reported CVSS v3.0 Base Score is 8.1/10.
- Specific locations in the `build.gradle` and `groovy` files are identified where the insecure HTTP downloads occur.
- The fix involves changing the dependency resolution to use HTTPS.
