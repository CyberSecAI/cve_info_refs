- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Lack of authentication in file-viewing components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Missing authentication for accessing claim files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized remote access to claim files.
- **Attack vectors**: Visiting guessable URLs of the form `dashboard/uploads/claim_files/claim_id_`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to know or guess the `claim_id` to access the specific claim file via the exposed URL. Network access is required.
