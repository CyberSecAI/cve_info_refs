**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the BOSH Director not properly redacting credentials in logs when configured to use a MySQL database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system where the BOSH Director is running and the ability to read the logs.
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a local authenticated user.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   Cloud Foundry BOSH versions 270.x prior to v270.1.1.
