Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11249:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `kubectl cp` command in Kubernetes had incomplete fixes for previous directory traversal vulnerabilities (CVE-2019-1002101 and CVE-2019-11246). This allowed a malicious container to create or replace files on the client machine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The `kubectl cp` command did not properly sanitize file paths, allowing a malicious container to potentially write files outside of the intended destination directory. This was related to how symlinks were handled during the copy operation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** A malicious container could cause files to be created or replaced on a user's workstation when they used the `kubectl cp` operation to copy files from the container.
- **Client-Side Defect:** The vulnerability is client-side, affecting the machine where the user is running the `kubectl` command, rather than the Kubernetes cluster itself.
- **User Interaction Required:** Exploitation requires a user to interact by using the vulnerable `kubectl cp` command against a malicious container.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious container that is able to influence the source path of a copy operation through crafted symbolic links.
- The client (`kubectl`) executing `kubectl cp` against the malicious container.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to run a malicious container within the Kubernetes cluster.
- User needs to execute `kubectl cp` command against the malicious container.
- Attacker does not need to have control over the client machine.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is a client-side defect, requiring user interaction.
- This vulnerability is related to previous issues CVE-2019-1002101 and CVE-2019-11246.
- Patches were released to address this vulnerability in multiple versions of Kubernetes (1.13.9, 1.14.5, 1.15.2) and also affects OpenShift container platform.
- Older versions of Kubernetes shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage were not affected because they did not include symlink support in 'kubectl cp'.
