- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Logic issue in the subsystem of Intel AMT
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Logic error leading to potential privilege escalation
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker could potentially escalate privileges
- **Attack vectors:** Network access
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An unauthenticated attacker would need network access to the vulnerable system. The attack has a high complexity, and requires user interaction (UI:R).
