Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11460:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from multiple sources, including SUSE, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Gentoo, explicitly mentions CVE-2019-11460 and its relation to a sandbox escape vulnerability in `gnome-desktop`. This confirms the relevance of the content to the CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an incomplete fix in the `gnome-desktop` library for a previously known sandbox escape issue (CVE-2017-5226). The vulnerability lies in the improper filtering of the `TIOCSTI` ioctl within the thumbnailer sandbox, specifically on 64-bit systems. This allows a compromised thumbnailer to inject characters into the input buffer of the controlling terminal.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Incomplete Input Filtering:** The primary weakness is the insufficient filtering of the `TIOCSTI` ioctl, which allows arbitrary characters to be pushed into the terminal input buffer.
*   **Sandbox Escape:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the intended confines of the bubblewrap sandbox used for thumbnailers.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit can lead to arbitrary code execution on the host system if combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   **System Compromise:** An attacker could potentially gain control over a user's system through a compromised thumbnailer.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Exploitation can result in the compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability of the affected system as mentioned in CVSS scores.

**5. Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Thumbnailer:** The primary attack vector is a malicious thumbnailer, which could be triggered by downloading a malicious image file or through other means.
*   **TIOCSTI ioctl:** The specific mechanism used to execute the attack is by abusing the `TIOCSTI` ioctl to send input to the terminal.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Local Access (Initially):** While some sources mention a "Network" attack vector in CVSSv2 scores, the more accurate attack vector is local access, as indicated by the CVSSv3 scores from both SUSE and Ubuntu. The attacker doesn't require network access to exploit the vulnerability once a malicious thumbnailer is present.
*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker requires a low privilege or the privileges of the user who executes the vulnerable code.
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required, such as being tricked into opening a malicious file.

**Additional Details (Beyond official CVE Description):**
*   Some sources highlight the similarity to CVE-2019-10063, indicating a common pattern in the vulnerability.
*   The SUSE Bugzilla entry specifies the affected versions as those prior to 3.30.2.2 and 3.32.1.1.
*   The content also mentions that flatpak also had similar issues.
*   The Ubuntu security notice (USN-3994-1) states that a user would be tricked into downloading a malicious image file.
*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 201908-28) explicitly mentions the vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the sandbox.

**In summary:** CVE-2019-11460 is a sandbox escape vulnerability in the `gnome-desktop` library that can be exploited using a malicious thumbnailer via the `TIOCSTI` ioctl due to an incomplete fix for a prior issue. This could lead to code execution by the attacker on the victim's machine. This issue impacts several Linux distributions and requires local access or user interaction and some degree of low privileges.
