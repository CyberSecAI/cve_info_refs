Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2019-11170:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Authentication bypass in Intel(R) Baseboard Management Controller firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*  The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper authentication mechanisms within the BMC firmware. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication checks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can achieve information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data.
*   Privilege escalation, gaining higher access levels than intended.
*   Denial of service (DoS), rendering the BMC unusable.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Local access is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* An unauthenticated attacker needs to have local access to the affected system.

This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated local user to gain unauthorized access to the BMC, leading to potential information disclosure, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
