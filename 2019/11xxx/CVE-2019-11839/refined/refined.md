The provided content relates to CVE-2019-11839.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `Array.prototype.push()` function after a resize operation within the njs JavaScript engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The vulnerability allows writing beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution by overwriting data on the heap.
- Denial of Service: The overflow could also result in crashes or other denial-of-service conditions.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a JavaScript code snippet that triggers an array resize, an attacker can cause an overflow during the `push` operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within the njs environment.
- No specific position is required as this is triggered by specific javascript code.
