Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11619:

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Location:** `\doorgets\app\requests\user\configurationRequest.php`
*   **Affected Version:** doorGets 7.0
*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input used in a database query within the `configurationRequest.php` script, specifically when the `action` parameter is set to `analytics`. The code encodes the values of the array but not the keys and directly calls the `dbQU` function for database query operations. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code via the array keys.
*   **Attack Vector:** An authenticated attacker with "Remote background administrator privilege user(or a user with permission to manage configuration analytics)" can inject SQL queries by manipulating the keys in the POST request to `/dg-user/?controller=configuration&action=analytics`.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., database user).
*   **Attacker requirements:** The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials or a user account with permissions to manage configuration analytics in the doorGets CMS.

    **Example Attack Sequence:**

    1.  The attacker logs into the doorGets CMS with administrator privileges.
    2.  The attacker crafts a malicious POST request to `/dg-user/?controller=configuration&action=analytics`. This request includes specially crafted array keys designed to inject SQL code. For example, the attacker could set a key like `configuration_analytics_analytics=(select/**/user())/**/where/**/id=1#`.
    3.  The server-side script `configurationRequest.php` processes the request. Because the array keys are not sanitized, the injected SQL code is incorporated into the database query.
    4.  The database executes the attacker's injected SQL code.
    5.  The results of the injected SQL query are returned to the attacker, potentially revealing sensitive information. In the given example, the database user (`root@localhost`) is disclosed.
