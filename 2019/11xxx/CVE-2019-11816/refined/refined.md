Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a privilege escalation bug in the access control implementation of OPNsense. Specifically, it allowed an authenticated user to gain access to pages for which they should not have had privileges. The forum post notes this vulnerability as addressed in OPNsense version 19.1.8, "addressing several privilege escalation issues in the access control implementation". The Netgate blog post indicates that similar issues were addressed in pfSense version 2.4.4-p3, where "an authenticated user could have used a technique similar to directory traversal to gain access to pages for which they otherwise would not have privileges".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Authenticated users were able to access pages they were not authorized to view or modify, allowing them to gain higher privileges than intended.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The implementation of access controls was flawed, allowing users to bypass intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive areas of the system they should not have access to. This could lead to configuration changes, data exfiltration, or other malicious actions, such as executing shell scripts through OpenVPN advanced options.
- **System Compromise:** The privilege escalation could potentially lead to full system compromise by gaining administrator level privileges, allowing for complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability could be exploited by an authenticated user who could leverage a directory traversal-like technique to access unauthorized pages or by taking advantage of the ability to edit advanced options in OpenVPN, leading to shell script execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** An attacker would need to have valid user credentials to log in to the system.
- **Basic Understanding:** Attackers needed a basic understanding of how access controls were implemented on the system. In the case of OpenVPN advanced options, basic knowledge of shell scripting would be required.

**Summary**

The vulnerability described in the content is a privilege escalation issue within the access control implementation of OPNsense and pfSense. It allowed authenticated, non-admin users to access restricted pages and potentially execute shell commands through OpenVPN. Patches for this vulnerability were included in OPNsense 19.1.8 and pfSense 2.4.4-p3.
