Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-11407:

**Vulnerability:** Information disclosure through debug parameter

**Root Cause:** The operator panel module in FusionPBX has a debug parameter that, when enabled, outputs sensitive information. Specifically, it dumps the contents of several arrays, including the `$_SESSION` array.

**Weaknesses:**
  - Lack of input sanitization or filtering of debug parameters.
  - Exposing sensitive information (e.g., the FreeSWITCH event socket interface password) through the debug output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Disclosure of sensitive information, including the FreeSWITCH event socket password and potentially other session data.
  - The leaked FreeSWITCH event socket password could allow an attacker to gain further control over the PBX system and its communications.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - By accessing the operator panel with a request that includes the debug parameter, an attacker can view the debug output and extract sensitive information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to send a request to the vulnerable operator panel.
  - No authentication is required for the basic information disclosure.

**Additional Details:**
- The content reveals the specific location of the vulnerable code within FusionPBX.
- It details how this vulnerability is part of a chain of exploits with other CVEs like CVE-2019-11408 and CVE-2019-11409.
