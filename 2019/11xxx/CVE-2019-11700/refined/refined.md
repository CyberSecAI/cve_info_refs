Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper mitigation when handling the `res://` protocol in Mozilla Firefox on Windows. The `res://` protocol, intended for accessing local resources, could be exploited to open local files through a crafted hyperlink. This is due to Firefox not blocking or restricting the use of `res://` URLs, specifically when it redirects to javascript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted `res://` protocol:** Firefox does not sufficiently restrict the `res://` protocol, allowing it to be used to access local files and execute javascript.
*   **Lack of proper input sanitization:** The browser does not properly sanitize or validate the parameters in the `res://` URLs before passing it to Internet Explorer.
*   **Prompt bypass:** The "Launch Application" prompt associated with the res:// protocol can be easily bypassed by pressing the "Enter" key, potentially tricking users into running malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** An attacker can execute JavaScript code at the renderer process privilege (Low IL) within Internet Explorer.
*   **Privilege escalation:** By exploiting vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, it is possible to escalate the privileges of the executed code (e.g., from Low IL to Medium IL).
*   **File access:** Although the attacker cannot directly read the file contents, they can force the browser to open files at known locations.
*   **Information disclosure:** The vulnerability can also be used in conjunction with other IE vulnerabilities to potentially read the content of local files and disclose OS username.
*   **Combined attack scenarios:** When combined with other vulnerabilities (such as IE exploits and bugs that can be triggered in the browser), a more severe attack can be achieved which allows to read files from a medium integrity level using JS, which is essentially a local privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted hyperlinks:** An attacker can embed a malicious `res://` URL into a website or email.
*   **User interaction:** The user needs to click on the malicious link and then either click the "Open link" button, or just press the Enter key, when prompted by the "Launch Application" dialog.
* **Cross-origin redirection**: The "Launch Application" dialog is still presented to the user even after the page has redirected to a different origin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious hyperlinks:** The attacker needs to be able to create a hyperlink with a crafted `res://` URL and convince the victim to click on it.
*   **Knowledge of local file paths:** The attacker needs to know, or guess, the file paths of local files they want to target.
*   **Internet Explorer vulnerability knowledge**: Knowledge of IE vulnerabilities and ways to trigger them through the res:// protocol is beneficial for a more impactful attack (e.g. medium IL code execution), though not strictly necessary for the initial attack to work.
*   **Windows environment:** The attack is specific to Windows operating systems.
