Networking
▾

Core :: Networking
For bugs in Mozilla's modular networking library (aka "Netlib" or "Necko".) The networking library supplies the software interface that Mozilla uses to access physical transports (e.g. the Internet and local drives), perform URL resolutions, and handle a variety of networking protocols.

Examples of appropriate bugs: URLs with backslash not fetched; URLs starting with a single slash turn into http:///; Cannot access authenticated FTP site.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.131 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

We can run res:// scheme from Firefox, which allows us to run JavaScript at renderer process privilege (Low IL) in Internet Explorer.

POC:

<script>window.open("res://apds.dll/redirect.html?target=javascript:alert(1)", "\_self");</script>

Test on: <https://pwning.click/ffres.php>

Actual results:

Firefox open res:// URL which runs JavaScript at renderer process privilege (Low IL).

Expected results:

Firefox does not allow res:// URL

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]:

I'm 90% sure this is just a pref flip, we should fix this.

The summary is generic, but the steps here only highlight the res: protocol on Windows. Are there other protocols you're aware of that need restricting? What do other browsers (esp. other than IE, of course) do?

1. That example runs JavaScript from IE normal protected mode sandbox, which has more attack surface & vulnerable.
2. We are able to run Medium IL JavaScript using IE bug.

Test on: <https://pwning.click/ffres2.php>

For answer to the question, Edge and IE does not allow redirection to res:// scheme. Chrome allows to open res:// but prompts opener which has default on set on "cancel" but not open button. Also, Chrome's URI opener disappears when page is redirected to Cross-Origin site, while Firefox's Launch Application opens normally with default set on "open link" button after Cross-Origin redirection.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Fairly easily
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: Everything
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Trivial - it's just setting a single pref. That pref has been supported since ~forever. We could even hotfix for 66 if we think this is severe enough, but I think it (a) probably isn't and (b) we're releasing 67 soon so I don't think there's a point.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: It won't. Knowing the craziness of the internet, there might be complaints that we broke a "convenient" way of launching IE from Firefox. From a quick look, this hole is not abused by extant add-ons on AMO, which use native client APIs to start IE.

(To be clear, there is nothing in the checkin comment or as comments in the patch, but purely the patch contents should be enough for people to work out where the issue is.)

* **List of other uplifts needed**: n/a
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: This is just a (hidden) pref flip building on existing infrastructure to disallow linking to certain protocols
* **String changes made/needed**: n/a

Needinfo for Dan to have a chance to consider this, but:

* there's a prompt (however imperfect the prompt is, you filed another bug about that...), and the requirements for user interaction probably constrain the overall severity
* I don't know anything about high/medium/low IL stuff in IE, but if you can escalate what happens in IE (which is what I assume based on [comment #0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") which talks about low IL, vs [comment #9](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833#c9 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)") talking about medium IL) that seems like more of an IE bug than anything else.

Do we want this on ESR, considering it's a pref flip so it's easy to fix?

I'm worried about enterprises which might use this "feature" in their environments. Given the low severity, I'd probably lean towards not uplifting to ESR unless there's a compelling reason to do so.

> Needinfo for Dan to have a chance to consider this,

In broad strokes this is roughly equivalent to opening a file:/// url in Firefox, which we try hard to prevent. In the file:/// case we simply don't allow it (unless you copy paste into a fresh tab); with res: we have just a prompt between opening it or not, like any other registered URL Handler. Shortcomings in the delay and the "hold down enter" attack on that prompt are already on file, but fair to consider given that MS has apparently blocked res: since IE6 SP1 (from the Internet Zone at least).

The attacker still can't "read" the files, only cause files at known locations to be loaded. There might be an IE exploit, and that's a worry, but it's as likely from a remote web page as a local file. Maybe if you knew/guessed the download folder, and had previously convinced a user to download an .html file, then you could get it to run locally with same-origin access to all the files on disk (you'd still have to convince the user to allow the page's scripts to run). I'm having trouble talking myself into calling this "moderate". Am I missing avenues for taking advantage of this?

The fact that you can escalate the IE sandbox from low to medium is a bug in IE and not relevant to the firefox severity: that part gets you a sec-vector ("someone else's vulnerability") rating.

Would it be considered as sec-low even I can run Medium IL JavaScript and any files with this bug?(In reply to :Gijs (he/him) from [comment #13](/show_bug.cgi?id=1549833#c13 "VERIFIED FIXED - Lack of mitigation on external protocol execution (res: protocol)"))

> * there's a prompt (however imperfect the prompt is, you filed another bug about that...), and the requirements for user interaction probably constrain the overall severity

1. There's a prompt which is default to "Open link", which allow attackers to trick users by just clicking enter. Also, the Launch Application is present even the page is redirected to other sites which could be a potential problem.
2. You gain mandatory Integrity level of Medium when you achieved full Remote Code Execution "with" Sandbox Escape. Which means, attackers are able to run JavaScript and some commands in normal user's privilege - out side of the Sandbox.

More importantly, this is not an IE bug but a bug when "res://" URL is triggered from other applications such like browsers. So this is a bug in all Windows based applications (windows bug). If you try to open the test link in IE, IE blocks res:// URL correctly at AppContainer. So if we run res://ieframe.dll/navcancl.htm#command on other browsers which are not Microsoft Browsers, IE will pop at Medium IL so we are able to run command at Medium IL.

1. I talked about this briefly in previous reply, we are not only able to run file:// url but also other commands and JavaScript. Running arbitrary Medium IL JavaScript is clearly Privilege Escalation, I believe this deserves at least a moderate severity. Yes, "Hold down enter" attack is already on file. The reason I separately reported is because lot's of users will likely be more convinced to run Launch Application without knowing when we use that bug with this.
2. Well, like I stated before at the least attackers are able to run "Medium IL JavaScript" which I believe it's more severe compared to just reading files. Also, "only cause files at known locations to be loaded." is not true. We are able to load any files from unknown locations too. I do have lot's of IE Vulnerabilities, one of them allows to read files from Medium IL so we are able to combinate Medium IL JavaScript attack to read files but like I said before, running Medium IL JavaScript is already severe enough.

And yes, download html files and running html is also a scenario but I think it's not that useful at the point when you can just run Medium IL JS straightforwardly.

Fair enough, I should have said it's a "Microsoft" vulnerability. If `res:` is too dangerous to allow from IE's internet zone it shouldn't be an advertised "URL Protocol" in the system for all apps to use.

> Following example reads chrome.exe from users "without" using IE bug.

You caused the content to open in notepad; the victim is the one reading it. Maybe you can get there if you can open your own content as .html from the local zone, then you could read other files with xhr and post them back to the attack server. Seems reasonably likely that it's possible, but that's not what your example shows.

We are able to disclose OS username using input tag:

<http://pwning.click/osuname.php>

We are able to detect the file presence from local zone and AppContainer using onreadystatechange:

<iframe src="res://C%3a%5cProgram Files%5cWindows Media Player%5cwmplayer.exe/24/1" onreadystatechange="count++"></iframe>

<script>

count = 0;

window.onload = function()

{

if (count == 1) alert("File exists!");

else alert("File does not exist");

}

</script>

We are also able to steal the file from user on local zone and Low IL using hyp3rlinx's XXE bug:

Why does the advisory on FF 67: <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2019-13/#CVE-2019-11700> does not include that this issue could be used for Elevation of Privilege, detecting and reading files from users? I assume the later is not included because it's the bug from IE side but the EoP isn't.

Also, even if the later is the bug from IE side, both file detection and reading files are publicly disclosed.

Which means every attacker could've detect, read files and elevate privilege using this bug and combination of those known bug + OS Username reading bug I shared above to execute automate downloaded html file on C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Downloads\exploit.html with no user interaction.

##### Description

If hyperthreading is not disabled, a timing attack vulnerability exists, similar to previous Spectre attacks. Apple has shipped macOS 10.14.5 with an option to disable hyperthreading in applications running untrusted code in a thread through a new sysctl. Firefox now makes use of it on the main thread and any worker threads.
*Note: users need to update to macOS 10.14.5 in order to take advantage of this change.*

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

Using attached PoC:

1. If you don't have bookmarks bar open then open sidebar bookmark page by pressing CTRL+B
2. Drag and drop the anchor tag into the bookmark bar/sidebar
3. Now drag and drop the newly created bookmark into the webpages body

Actual results:

For some reason the dragged object from the bookmark bar contains 'text/html' formatted data of all the queried history entries. Which means we can steal users history data (even loaded iframes) with precision, thanks to the use of the places query.

Step [2] creates a places query ( <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/Places/Places_query_URIs> ) that looks like:

place:type=0&sort=1&terms=token&maxResults=10&includeHidden=true

I am looking within the users history for any entry with the term 'token' in the URL, for testing purposes I only grab 10 entries but this could be increased in an attack scenario. I also use the 'includeHidden' query operator to include otherwise hidden history entries that come from iframes and images, just to further expand my net.

Step [3] is where I think the bug exists. Once we drag the newly created places query bookmark back into our webpage, we can read all the results from our query by reading the 'text/html' data entry.

Expected results:

There should not be a ''text/html' readable data when drag and dropping bookmarks from firefox and to firefox. I believe this may have been put there for cross application compatibility but is of no use (AFAIK) when it comes to drag and dropping within firefox.

> Marco, how hard would it be to only provide the text/html flavour for non-Firefox, or system privileged bits of Firefox or something?

First because when you start a drag&drop you can't tell where the drop will happen, so you can't really exclude anything. You just have to put all the info in the dataTransfer object and let the consumer handle it.

Second the user may be willing to drop into a text file or a third party app, that is indeed a feature we wanted.

I think we may go the opposite way, disallow dropping a place: url on a Places view if the only available flavor is text, we have a Places flavor for chrome to chrome drops, so there's no reason we should allow to drop a place: url from a text flavor.

Obviously the above solution will disallow the page from creating specific queries, it will still be possible to drop an existing query... Though we don't create anymore smart queries, so it's likely only advanced users have some, and those are unlikely to fall for this kind of trick. The only remaining thing you could drop is folders or Bookmark roots, it would be interesting to see which social skills one should use to convince a user to do that. It would still be possible anyway, and it would disclose the list of bookmarks in that folder/root. I'm not sure how to solve that while still allowing the possibility to drop a list of urls to a third party app.

Something I've just discovered is the [`mozSourceNode` property](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/dd7e27f4a805e4115d0dbee70e1220b23b23c567/dom/webidl/DataTransfer.webidl#152-157) on DataTransfer elements. I tested it briefly and it gives me the browser element for the web page in this case.

Could we do some sort of filtering based on that, e.g. checking the source and if it is content then disallow x-moz-place? (might need to make sure we still allow it for webextensions).

Let's sum up:

1. We can disallow extracting place uris from MOZ\_URL and UNICODE flavors, I'll file a separate bug to do this. This should disallow dragging or copying simple place: links from a page.
2. For drag&drop, we may check mozSourceNode to verify if the source is not Firefox chrome... But we can't do that for copy & paste because nor nsIClipboard, nor nsITransferable give us any info about the data source. So potentially a page may still create a dataTransfer or populate the clipboard with a MOZ\_PLACE flavor. We need a way to check if the clipboard contents come from Firefox chrome or somewhere else.
3. In any case if the user drags or pastes an existing container to content, we can't do much, unless we blacklist place flavors from reaching content (not sure how to do it, but it should be possible) and remove the possibility to drop containers on third party apps. This path is less data sensitive anyway because, if we fix 1) and 2), convincing the user to create a place query exposing all of history would be quite a challenge. Moreover, if we disallow place flavors from a second Firefox instance, the only way to support moving stuff across multiple instances will be the unicode part, that we already filtered out.

Basically, we need a way to:

a. Figure out the source in copy & paste case, is it Firefox chrome or something else? We should be able to accept WebExtensions generated data though. I think distinguishing chrome from content would be enough.

b. optionally blacklist certain flavors for content (so it can't add place flavors to the clipboard or a DataTransfer)

Neil, any idea of whether a), b) are currently possible from js with the existing APIs, and how complicate it would be to add them?

Note, we have another case that Mark is looking into, where we would like to know if the clipboard data comes from this instance of firefox or another one. So a solution supporting both cases would probably be the best. the DataTransfer mozSourceNode property seems ok, it just seems to not be available in the c&p case.

For b) you can block certain types from being added from content by adding them to DataTransfer::PrincipalMaySetData.

For a) I'm not clear from the description above what you're wanting to prevent. Could you provide the steps, or perhaps this is another bug referenced by [comment 7](/show_bug.cgi?id=1543191#c7 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing history data using places querying and drag and drop")?

Thanks, I'll file a separate bug to prevent place flavors from being added by content in PrincipalMaySetData.

I assume content may potentially create any kind of flavor, when we have an nsITransferable we know what it contains, but we don't know in which context it was created. The steps is:

1. content puts in the clipboard some data with a places flavor
2. somehow it convinces the user to paste it into the bookmarks toolbar
3. because the flavor and data is valid we do the action

It's true that by blocking the moz-place types from being added, as you suggested, we can prevent this, but I would feel safer if I could say "this data has been added by content, so I don't want to handle it", mostly because people tend to forget to update blacklists. It would be a gate check.

The other case we have, is that we need to recognize if the data comes from current Firefox or another instance of Firefox, because for example it may contain a bookmark with a GUID that is valid for the other instance but not for this one. We can't check all the guids because it would be really expensive (suppose the user dragged a thousand bookmarks), so we were thinking to use mozSourceNode, but that exists only for D&D, not for C&P.

The data in a DataTransfer is stored with the principal of the caller that put each item there, so that would probably be the route to handling this case. This information isn't passed on to the Transferable though, and I'm not sure if it currently gets preserved across process boundaries either.

> The other case we have, is that we need to recognize if the data comes from current Firefox or another instance of Firefox, because for example it may contain a bookmark with a GUID that is valid for the other instance but not for this one.

Essentially, to do this properly, you would need to know if the system clipboard is currently assigned by Firefox, and to know if another application takes ownership of the clipboard for its own data. This is possible, but we haven't had any need for this information so far, so would require some platform-specific work to implement.

I can't quite call this sec-high given the user interaction required, but this is pretty bad. It seems to be the bug is step 2 when we let a page create drag information about a URL it can't actually navigate to. Can we annotate drags with a "from untrusted content" flag so we can prevent that kind of thing?

Going to go with sec-high after some debate. the places search language means that if you could find a willing victim you could mine some very specific information about them.

The dependencies I filed, and that I'm patching, disallow pages from adding place: uris to d&d or c&p flavors, though we can't really disallow a user from dragging already existing bookmarks/history stuff to content, so you can potentially drag your Bookmarks Toolbar root or your history Today's container to content. I'm not sure how to disallow that without completely removing whole data exchange features that the user may want (like taking a whole list of urls to a third party app, and probably even a Web App).

Regarding the possibility to check drags from untrusted content, we can, but only for drag&drop, copy&paste doesn't seem to expose that info to javascript for now (that's what I was asking to Neil).

One side of this (allowing content to create a custom place: query) is now fixed in Nightly and I asked for uplift.

The other sides are more complex:

1. provide a way to tell from js whether the origin of the data was chrome; possible for d&d through mozSourceNode, not possible for the clipboard without platform work. This is not strictly necessary for this specific bug, because the dependencies are enough, but worth considering for the future. [Bug 1543954](/show_bug.cgi?id=1543954 "NEW - Need a way for clipboard to indicate if its source data is from the same running instance of Firefox or not") tracks a request to get more information regarding the clipboard.
2. disallow dropping Places containers to content; this is complex because one of the features of D&D and the clipboard is to share data with other apps, so a user may want to actually get the list of urls in a container, and currently he can just c&p or d&d the container to whatever third party app he wants, this includes Web Apps. Even if we'd disable dropping Places specific flavors to content, we'd still provide the same information in text flavors. I'm not sure how we could fix this without dropping the feature.

Trying to reproduce this bug is enough, the technical details are not that important for QA to verify it, imo (also because it would require to build a testcase identical to what we have in automation).

I agree, let's close this, I'll file a new bug to check the origin of drops. I'm not sure whether it's worth filing a bug for the possibility to drag an existing container to content, as I said that's actually a feature.

I filed [bug 1545840](/show_bug.cgi?id=1545840 "NEW - check origin of dropped data when it contains Places flavors") for checking origin of paste/drops. We can't do that without platform support, anyway.

Going back to my first instinct (sec-moderate) that this exploit requires more user interaction than we consider for sec-high.

Reproduced the initial issue described in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1543191#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing history data using places querying and drag and drop") using an old Nightly from 2019-04-09. Verified that the issue does not reproduce anymore using the steps provided in [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1543191#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Stealing history data using places querying and drag and drop") on latest Beta 67.0b13 and latest Nightly 68.0a1 across platforms (Windows 10 64bit, macOS 10.13 and Ubuntu 18.04 64bit).

Is this sufficient to mark this bug as verified fixed or do we want to keep it as is until [bug 1545840](/show_bug.cgi?id=1545840 "NEW - check origin of dropped data when it contains Places flavors") and [bug 1543954](/show_bug.cgi?id=1543954 "NEW - Need a way for clipboard to indicate if its source data is from the same running instance of Firefox or not") will be fixed?

Imo, we may consider this verified fixed, because it's no more possible to create a custom history view, the remaining bugs are tracking possible future improvements that will be done once it's possible (platform support), but they are just a second line of protection, that would be nice to have but it's not necessary to fix this specific case.

#### [#CVE-2019-11695: Custom cursor can render over user interface outside of web content](#CVE-2019-11695)

Reporter
bignis
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the addressbar to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the primary web content area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users into clicking on permission prompts, doorhanger notifications, or other buttons inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the user interface.

#### [#CVE-2019-11696: Java web start .JNLP files are not recognized as executable files for download prompts](#CVE-2019-11696)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi

#### [#CVE-2019-11698: Theft of user history data through drag and drop of hyperlinks to and from bookmarks](#CVE-2019-11698)

Reporter
Abdulrahman Alqabandi
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a crafted hyperlink is dragged and dropped to the bookmark bar or sidebar and the resulting bookmark is subsequently dragged and dropped into the web content area, an arbitrary query of a user's browser history can be run and transmitted to the content page via `drop` event data. This allows for the theft of browser history by a malicious site.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Christian Holler, Andrei Ciure, Julien Cristau, Jan de Mooij, Jan Varga, Marcia Knous, André Bargull, and Philipp reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 66. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.
