The provided content contains information about two distinct out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities discovered in recutils version 1.8. Both issues are triggered when using the `rec2csv` utility.

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `rec_rset_get_props` function due to a call to `strdup` with a null or invalid string pointer
*   **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read. The `strdup` function attempts to copy a string at the provided address, but the provided address is a null pointer, resulting in reading memory outside of the allowed bounds.
*   **Impact:** The program crashes due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Attack vector:**  The `rec2csv` utility is run with a crafted input, that results in an invalid string being passed to the `rec_rset_get_props` function
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the `rec2csv` program with the specifically crafted input file.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root cause:** An out-of-bounds read occurs in the `rec_field_name_equal_p` function due to a call to `strcmp` with a null or invalid string pointer
*   **Weakness:** Out-of-bounds read. The `strcmp` function attempts to compare two strings, but one of the string pointers is a null pointer or invalid, resulting in reading memory outside of the allowed bounds.
*  **Impact:** The program crashes due to a segmentation fault.
*   **Attack vector:**  The `rec2csv` utility is run with a crafted input, that results in an invalid string being passed to the `rec_field_name_equal_p` function via `rec_rset_get_props`.
*   **Required attacker capabilities:** The attacker needs the ability to execute the `rec2csv` program with the specifically crafted input file.

These vulnerabilities were found by a fuzzer and reported in a bug report.
