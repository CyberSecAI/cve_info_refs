User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0

Steps to reproduce:

Cross-origin images introduce a 'taint' into things like canvas and SVG filters to prevent image stealing. However, images in SVG load slightly differently than normal <img> elements. Images in SVG documents will display from the cache first, then re-display after revalidating with the server. It seems that the taint isn't introduced until the server has responded (e.g. with a 304 Not Modified). Before this happens, it's possible to use the image in ways that would normally fail or cause a security exception. Normal HTML images don't seem to behave in this way - they don't display at all until they've been revalidated.

The attached testcase has an SVG filter that uses feImage to load a cross-origin image. It than uses CanvasRenderingContext2D.filter to apply the filter to a canvas and toDataURI to copy the image data. On first load toDataURI call causes an error because the image isn't cached. If you refresh the page, toDataURI works and gets a copy of the cross-origin image, due to the tainting delay.

Actual results:

Can use a cross-origin image from SVG without triggering tainting

Expected results:

Taint should apply even when image is displayed from cache, before revalidation

The attached testcase doesn't seem to load properly for me - it goes into a weird redirect loop. The same testcase is at <http://dev.jigawatt.co.uk/dev/svgimgsteal/> which seems to work ok.

|  | |

To clarify, it looks like this only applies to feImage, not normal SVG images. SVGFEImageElement::OutputIsTainted returns false if the load isn't complete yet, even though the cached image data is available to the filter.

Same for me -- specifically, the first load works, but subsequent (re)loads trigger a redirect-failure error page. This is a recent bugzilla regression, and :dylan is now aware & hopefully will fix it before long.

For the time being, the bugzilla attachment isn't directly usable as a PoC, but it reproduces the bug if you download it and run it locally (or use the version from [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715#c1 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-origin image stealing using SVG filters and canvas")).

I can't reproduce this bug in release, so this seems to be a regression. I'm working on tracking down a regression range now.

[EDIT: actually I can reproduce in release 67, but it's just much flakier/harder-to-trigger than in Nightly; more in next comment]

Hmm, actually I suspect this didn't so much "regress", but rather just started reproducing reliably instead of infrequently.

"Regression range" from mozregression, using a locally-saved version of the attached PoC:

<https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/pushloghtml?fromchange=74b2c66643c90b1a7f161136bdf0ce8fa1178396&tochange=87b426177fadd80991f6234939daeb80f9b17130>

--> [bug 1525356](/show_bug.cgi?id=1525356 "RESOLVED FIXED - Cache the Document's base domain to avoid recomputing it over and over again inside ThirdPartyUtil::IsThirdPartyWindow()")

Before that range, this reproduces very infrequently -- most of the time the top and bottom of the testcase are blank, and only the occasional reload will have the image at top + bottom.

After that range, this reproduces 100% reliably on the first reload.

(So: I'm guessing this wasn't so much a "regression" but rather a race condition being fixed, which happens to make this bug easier to trigger.)

We probably need to update this chunk of code (which is invoked when we set the canvas's filter):

<https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/da14c413ef663eb1ba246799e94a240f81c42488/dom/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.cpp#2382-2392>

...to analyze the filter and see if there's an feImage (or more specifically, a cross-origin feImage).

We do have a bool there "sourceGraphicIsTainted", but that doesn't get set at all based on the filter. We should perhaps make that an outparam and do some filter analysis to adjust that boolean, to reflect the fact that the *filter itself* may be tainted (not just the source graphic).

|  | |

(i.e. the fix here may want to go inside of nsFilterInstance::GetFilterDescription, perhaps by making its `aFilterInputIsTainted` arg into an in/outparam and updating it if we find a feImage)

Anyway: I'll step back at this point since :baku's assigned -- hopefully [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715#c10 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-origin image stealing using SVG filters and canvas")-11 gives some ideas here.

baku, if you can't get to this, then jwatt or longsonr or I could take a look instead. Or possibly mstange, who worked on [bug 1307740](/show_bug.cgi?id=1307740 "RESOLVED FIXED - SecurityError after using canvas.filter") which added a previous incarnation of this code including some of the taintedness stuff in the context here.

I suspect that the fix should be done at an imgRequest cache level. It's important to cache if the image had cross-origin redirects.

At the moment I don't know when I can work on this bug. Maybe next week, but I'm not 100% sure.

If somebody else wants to take this bug, it would be great. Let me NI aosmond.

A mechanism for looking at the filter primitives already exists, and [comment 2](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715#c2 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-origin image stealing using SVG filters and canvas") pointed it out correctly: The fix probably needs to go into `SVGFEImageElement::OutputIsTainted`. More specifically, we need to find out [which of the return false branches](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0671407b7b9e3ec1ba96676758b33316f26887a4/dom/svg/SVGFEImageElement.cpp#246-273) is taken and do something about still-loading cross-origin images.

[The code that propagates filter taintedness back to the canvas is after the call to `RenderFilterDescription`.](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0671407b7b9e3ec1ba96676758b33316f26887a4/dom/canvas/CanvasRenderingContext2D.cpp#440-442)

Looks like currentRequest->GetImageStatus(&status) is returning a status of 0. mIsValidating is true so we end up in here: <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/image/imgRequestProxy.cpp#712>, returning imgIRequest::STATUS\_NONE

That suggests that the caller (canvas) is calling too early somehow, i.e. before the filter has completed but after it has started painting. If we changed the logic to return true at that point it would always fail which seems wrong too.

the caller javascript should wait (if it is to work properly), so I guess <https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/0671407b7b9e3ec1ba96676758b33316f26887a4/dom/svg/SVGFEImageElement.cpp#254> should simply return true if the load is not complete rather than false if it is.

re: [comment 18](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715#c18 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-origin image stealing using SVG filters and canvas"), returning true while a cached image is revalidating would presumably cause a same-origin image to taint the canvas. Properly written JavaScript should wait until the image has loaded, but if you don't you'll get weird intermittent behaviour where the canvas is sometimes tainted for no obvious reason.

A fix for this bug should either:

* prevent a cached image from being painted at all (I think this is what normal HTML/SVG images do, but I need to check)
* or, check the origin of the cached image (but I suspect this would be tricky to do correctly)

I double-checked the behaviour of cached <img> and SVG <image> while they're revalidating:

* <img> will not display a cached copy at all, until revalidated
* SVG <image> will display while revalidating, but won't draw to canvas until revalidated

[Bug 1559715](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-origin image stealing using SVG filters and canvas") r=dholbert

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Seems fairly straightforward, we can infer we need an FEImage filter and that somehow canvas taintedness is involved as is whether we think we've painted something. If you wanted to have an example of a change that couldn't avoid painting a bullseye on what to do to exploit it, this is it. There's not much I can do with a check-in comment to hide it and there's no tests landing in this patch.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: [Bug 941887](/show_bug.cgi?id=941887 "RESOLVED FIXED - feDisplacementMap should check taintedness of the image with the displacements")
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: This patch should work everywhere. And we're going to need to land it everywhere too.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Really simple, should be safe.

I think this needs to land late in the cycle (which just began). I'm going to give Sec-approval+ for landing on August 9 (yes, a month) since it seems like this will be pretty obvious once we check in. We'll want it on beta as well (and ESR60) at that time.

Thanks, Al. I can take an action to make sure we land & request uplift on August 9th. I added a calendar-event to ping me and jwatt to remind us.

Yup. And also ESR68.

Paul, thanks again for reporting this!

We expect this specific issue to be resolved when Firefox 69 is released.

As an open source project, we assume that people monitor our check-ins. This is why we only land security patches shortly before the end of a release cycle.

Please see <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Bug_Approval_Process> if you want to know more about how we fix security bugs.

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: Information disclosure. (cross-origin image reading)
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: No
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: Yes
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**: 1. Load <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=9072463> or <http://dev.jigawatt.co.uk/dev/svgimgsteal/>

2. Refresh the page a few times.

BUGGY RESULTS: After you've refreshed, two copies of the image show up (one under "Canvas" and one under "data URI").

EXPECTED RESULTS:

* Only the upper image should show up. Nothing should appear under "data URI".
* In Web Console (ctrl+shift+K), you should see an entry saying something like `SecurityError: The operation is insecure` with a link to line 23 of the testcase.
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: It simply removes an early permissive return for not-yet-loaded images during our "should this image cause the canvas to be tainted (unreadable-by-the-page)" security checklist. After the patch, we'll now perform **the same** checks on images regardless of whether they're loaded or not, which seems intuitively correct and strictly safer than what we were doing before.
* **String changes made/needed**: None.

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: This is sec:high.
* **User impact if declined**: Information disclosure. (cross-origin image reading)
* **Fix Landed on Version**: 70
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: It simply removes an early permissive return for not-yet-loaded images during our "should this image cause the canvas to be tainted (unreadable-by-the-page)" security checklist. After the patch, we'll now perform **the same** checks on images regardless of whether they're loaded or not, which seems intuitively correct and strictly safer than what we were doing before.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: None.

This is "no" because it hasn't landed in Nightly yet -- see [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715#c27 "VERIFIED FIXED - Cross-origin image stealing using SVG filters and canvas"). However, I have verified the fix in a local build.

Al: it's the landing day but it seems we still need beta/ESR approvals. (Probably should've requested them earlier; I forgot that separate approval would be needed until a few days ago.)

How should I proceed?

(Should I go ahead and land on Nightly to get this baking/tested there sooner rather than later, and assume branch uplift approvals are coming within a few days, and land on branches when those approvals arrive?)

mccr8 confirms in IRC that m-c landing doesn't need to be gated on uplift approvals for situations like this, so I'll proceed with a m-c landing.

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

Reporter

Impact

##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11752: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11752)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

|  | |

When creating any element (except "template" and "script" tags) using "document.createElement()" and "document.createElementNS()" function the provided HTML code gets rendered directly. Ideally the HTML code should not get rendered until it is manually inserted into DOM using "appendChild()" or similar function. I tested this issue on Chrome, Opera and Safari, they do not render the HTML code directly, also the HTML specs does not explicitly states to render the HTML code directly when creating the Elements. (Reference : <https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-document-createelement>)

For Example :

document.createElement("AnyElementBlahBlah").innerHTML="<svg/onload=alert()>"

This code would execute "alert()" function directly. We did not even need to insert the element in DOM.

Here's another interesting example :

document.createElement("title").innerHTML="</title><svg/onload=alert()>"

Here the content of "title" element should not be rendered at all but we are able to escape out of "title" tag context by prepending a closing "title" tag as shown in above example. Using this trick we can render our HTML code inside "title" element as well and execute our Javascript code. Damn.

The same flaw applies to "document.createElementNS()" as well.

For example :

document.createElementNS("<http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml>", "title").innerHTML="</title><svg onload=alert()>"

Impact:

It can introduce XSS vulnerability to many web applications because HTML specs does not states to render HTML such a way and also the other browsers does not follow this practice so technically it would be safe to allow untrusted input like "document.createElement("title").innerHTML='UntrustedUserInput' " as long as the input is verified before inserting it to DOM, however for Firefox that's not the case because Firefox will render the Untrusted Input directly which would lead to execution of malicious Javascript as well.

Tested On :

* Firefox 68.0b13 (64-bit)
* Firefox 67.0.4 (64-bit)

Henri, is this something you can look at? It looks vaguely related to [bug 395597](/show_bug.cgi?id=395597 "RESOLVED FIXED - <script> created by innerHTML setter on element not in the document, followed by adding the element to the document, executes the script, unlike html5 spec"), but script elements don't seem to work. I don't know if there are other mechanisms besides `<svg onload>` that would accomplish script execution here.

Hi,

It’s not just about SVG element. Any element that can fire event handler without user interaction would work here.

For example : <img/src onerror=alert()>

This is cross-browser behavior. The Web depends on disconnected `img` elements starting fetches. (Not sure about the level of dependency of `onerror` working for those fetches.)

The idea that `innerHTML` on disconnected elements is inert without a `template` is mistaken.

> document.createElement("title").innerHTML="</title><svg/onload=alert()>"

Two different bugs here: breakout from `title` and the `onload`.

For the SVG bug, investigation of the XML side is also needed.

(Given the `img onerror` behavior, I'm unconvinced that `svg onload` is a *security* bug, but the `title` breakout is.)

The SVG2 spec suggests that the parser no longer needs to dispatch a `load` event for every `svg` element. Am I reading the spec correctly and is the change Web-compatible?

Allowing to break out of "title" tag context definitely has more security impact.

However I am not able to understand why this SVG thing is being investigated here. I believe there's no bug in SVG because any HTML code would work.

For example :

document.createElement("x").innerHTML="<audio src=x onerror=alert()>" // It would alert

document.createElement("x").innerHTML="<input type=image src=x onerror=alert()>" // It would alert

document.createElement("x").innerHTML="<img src=x onerror=alert()>" // It would alert

If you are thinking it's an "onerror" event handler issue then let me tell you it's not. Because:

document.createElement("x").innerHTML="<img src='<https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0>' onload=alert()>" // It would alert

There is really nothing special about "SVG". From my understanding what actually happening is the provided code (Example : <audio src=x onerror=alert()>) is temporarily getting rendered and then removed instantly.

All of these alert in Chrome as well (except the `input type=image`, which seems like it's probably for some other reason like whether or not they fire the error event at all in that case).

Henri already addressed this:

(In reply to Henri Sivonen (:hsivonen) from [comment #3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - title.innerHTML = \"</title><foo>\" parses <foo> as a tag"))

In other words, the behaviour for `img` and `audio` is per spec. Websites should not depend on `innerHTML` being inert when run on disconnected elements. It isn't. I would be very surprised if any widespread HTML sanitizer library did have such a dependency - this type of thing is why `<template>` exists.

Let's handle `svg onload` as a different bug and keep this one for the `title` break-out, which clearly is a security bug.

Thanks for the further clarification. I agree that HTML sanitizers would most likely use "<template>" for sanitization purpose. Anyways I believe that allowing to break out of the elements definitely poses security risk. Also please note that just like "title" element, all of other elements like textarea, noscript, title, iframe, etc also breaks (except "template" element).

For example :

document.createElement("textarea").innerHTML="</textarea><svg/onload=alert()>"

document.createElement("noscript").innerHTML="</noscript><svg/onload=alert()>"

document.createElement("title").innerHTML="</title><svg/onload=alert()>"

document.createElement("iframe").innerHTML="</iframe><svg/onload=alert()>"

All of above lines of code will executed alert(). I'm still investigating this behaviour to find any good example to demonstrate the proper impact though. :)

In SVG 2 various SVG events with html equivalents use the html definition. [bug 500261](/show_bug.cgi?id=500261 "RESOLVED FIXED - svg image onerror fails to fire on any error") implements error and abort as html does. We've dropped SVGZoom and SVGScroll. I'm not sure we've ever sent SVGResize or maybe we did and dropped support. We've not changed SVGLoad to load yet but we should for simplicity.

We need to dispatch load events from documents as lots of code checks that when SVG is externally loaded e.g. from object/iframe. Currently we do that from the root svg element but we could probably do something more like html (and the spec) where it's to the window isn't it when the document has loaded? We should dispatch load events from <image> and <feImage> elements but I'm not sure we do.

[Bug 1562033](/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033 "RESOLVED FIXED - title.innerHTML = \"</title><foo>\" parses <foo> as a tag").

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Extremely easily from the patch. The harder part is locating a site that sets `innerHTML` on one of the affected elements with user-supplied unescaped input.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: [Bug 487949](/show_bug.cgi?id=487949 "RESOLVED FIXED - [HTML5] Land HTML5 parser on m-c preffed off")
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: The same patch applies.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Should be very unlikely. The other changeset (not to be landed at the same time) tests the various cases.

I'd like to land this once you're back so it is late in the cycle, given the obviousness of it from your sec-approval comments. So, sec-approval for August 5 (or immediately therafter). We'll want it on Beta and ESR60 after it lands there.

Henri, I tried with the attachment from [comment 27](/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033#c27 "RESOLVED FIXED - title.innerHTML = \"</title><foo>\" parses <foo> as a tag") and I get PASS on latest Nightly 70.0a1 (build ID 20190806214332) but also on an older build, without the fix: Nightly 70.0a1 from 08.05.2019 and on Beta 69.0b11. Shouldn't we get FAIL on builds where the fix was not landed?

I tested on Windows 10 x64.

Indeed. Sorry about a faulty test. Uploading a corrected test.

This one alerts only BASELINE when the bug is fixed and alerts both BASELINE and FAIL when the bug has not been fixed.

Reproduced this issue on Windows 10 on an older Nightly 70.0a1 without the fix.

Confirm the fix using the attachment from [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - title.innerHTML = \"</title><foo>\" parses <foo> as a tag") on latest Nightly 70.0a1, build ID 20190814094216 and Beta 69.0b13. Verified on Window 10 x64, Mac OS 10.14 and Ubuntu 18.04.

But, on latest ESR build 68.0.2esr (build id 20190813155538) with the same attachment from [comment 30](/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033#c30 "RESOLVED FIXED - title.innerHTML = \"</title><foo>\" parses <foo> as a tag") I get both alerts: FAIL and BASELINE.

Henri, could you please take a look?

The patch itself doesn't need rebasing, but [bug 1466449](/show_bug.cgi?id=1466449 "RESOLVED FIXED - Update HTML parser Tokenizer.java and StackNode.java for bug 1453795") needs uplifting into ESR60 as a prerequisite for the patch for this bug. Here's the rebased version of that patch. Where do we go from here in terms of the ESR uplift process?

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin.

##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Tyson Smith and Nathan Froyd reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, Firefox 60.8, Thunderbird 68, and Thunderbird 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

# CVE-2019-11743

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11742.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11744.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11743 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11743)

#### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the unload event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11739.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11741.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11740 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11740)

#### Description

Mozilla developers and community members reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68, Firefox ESR 68, and Firefox 60.8. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

# CVE-2019-11744

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11743.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11745.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11744 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11744)

#### Description

Some HTML elements, such as &lt;title&gt; and &lt;textarea&gt;, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to .innerHTML on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69, Thunderbird < 68.1, Thunderbird < 60.9, Firefox ESR < 60.9, and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 69

Announced
September 3, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 69

#### [#CVE-2019-11751: Malicious code execution through command line parameters](#CVE-2019-11751)

Reporter
Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
Impact
critical
##### Description

Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

* [Bug 1572838](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1572838)

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1564449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564449)

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

#### [#CVE-2019-11742: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images](#CVE-2019-11742)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

* [Bug 1559715](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715)

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1551913](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1551913)
* [Bug 1552206](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1552206)

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11752: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11752)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1501152](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152)

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

##### References

* [Bug 1538008](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008)
* [Bug 1538015](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015)

#### [#CVE-2019-11741: Isolate addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com](#CVE-2019-11741)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised sandboxed content process can perform a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack on content from any site it can cause to be loaded in the same process. Because `addons.mozilla.org` and `accounts.firefox.com` have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process.

* [Bug 1539595](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1539595)

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

##### References

* [Bug 1564588](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588)

#### [#CVE-2019-11749: Camera information available without prompting using getUserMedia](#CVE-2019-11749)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

##### References

* [Bug 1565374](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565374)

#### [#CVE-2019-5849: Out-of-bounds read in Skia](#CVE-2019-5849)

Reporter
Zhen Zhou of NSFOCUS Security Team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the Skia graphics library, allowing for the possible leaking of data from memory.

##### Description

A type confusion vulnerability exists in Spidermonkey, which results in a non-exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1568397](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397)

#### [#CVE-2019-11737: Content security policy directives ignore port and path if host is a wildcard](#CVE-2019-11737)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a wildcard ('\*') is specified for the host in Content Security Policy (CSP) directives, any port or path restriction of the directive will be ignored, leading to CSP directives not being properly applied to content.

##### References

* [Bug 1388015](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1388015)

#### [#CVE-2019-11738: Content security policy bypass through hash-based sources in directives](#CVE-2019-11738)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
low
##### Description

If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any `javascript:` URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions.

##### References

* [Bug 1452037](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452037)

#### [#CVE-2019-11747: 'Forget about this site' removes sites from pre-loaded HSTS list](#CVE-2019-11747)

Reporter
Thomas Henlich
Impact
low
##### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an `http:` URL rather than secure `https:` they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-26

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 68.1

Announced
September 3, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 68.1

#### [#CVE-2019-11751: Malicious code execution through command line parameters](#CVE-2019-11751)

Reporter
Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
Impact
critical
##### Description

Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1564449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564449)

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

#### [#CVE-2019-11742: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images](#CVE-2019-11742)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

* [Bug 1559715](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715)

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

#### [#CVE-2019-11749: Camera information available without prompting using getUserMedia](#CVE-2019-11749)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

#### [#CVE-2019-11738: Content security policy bypass through hash-based sources in directives](#CVE-2019-11738)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
low
##### Description

If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any `javascript:` URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions.

#### [#CVE-2019-11747: 'Forget about this site' removes sites from pre-loaded HSTS list](#CVE-2019-11747)

Reporter
Thomas Henlich
Impact
low
##### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an `http:` URL rather than secure `https:` they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

## Details

It was discovered that encrypted S/MIME parts in a multipart message can

leak plaintext contents when included in a HTML reply or forward in some

circumstances. If a user were tricked in to replying to or forwarding a

specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit this to

obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2019-11739](/security/CVE-2019-11739))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive

information, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, scause a denial

of service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11740](/security/CVE-2019-11740), [CVE-2019-11742](/security/CVE-2019-11742),
