The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11490.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by sending a malformed .pcap file with the npcap loopback adapter, which leads to kernel pool corruption. Specifically, the issue occurs when using `pcap_sendqueue_queue()` or `pcap_sendqueue_transmit()`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Kernel pool corruption due to malformed .pcap data.
- Double free of memory.
- Incorrect virtual address freed.
- Special pool memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution inside the Windows kernel.
- Elevation of privileges.
- System crash (BSOD)

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a malformed .pcap file to the npcap loopback adapter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to send malformed .pcap files.
- User level access to a machine running the vulnerable npcap driver.

**Additional Details:**

- The bug can be triggered using specifically crafted .pcap files provided in the report.
- Special Pool might need to be enabled to reliably trigger the crash.
- Stack traces from the crash dumps show the issue is occurring within the npcap driver (npcap.sys).
- The provided crash dumps show a `BAD_POOL_CALLER` error and `SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION` error with code 0xc2 and 0xc1, respectively.
- The pool tag `Io` is identified as the corrupted pool.
- Debugging information includes memory dumps and pool analysis, showing corrupted pool headers.
