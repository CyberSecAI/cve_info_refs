# Security flaw in EA’s Origin client exposed gamers to hackers

[Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/)

6:44 AM PDT · April 16, 2019

Electronic Arts has fixed a vulnerability in its online gaming platform Origin after security researchers found they could trick an unsuspecting gamer into remotely running malicious code on their computer.

The bug affected Windows users with the Origin app installed. Tens of millions of gamers use the Origin app to buy, access and download games. To make it easier to access an individual game’s store from the web, the client has its own URL scheme that allows gamers to open the app and load a game from a web page by clicking a link with `origin://` in the address.

But two security researchers, [Daley Bee](https://twitter.com/daley) and [Dominik Penner](https://twitter.com/zer0pwn) of [Underdog Security](https://underdogsecurity.com/), found that the app could be tricked into running any app on the victim’s computer.

“An attacker could’ve ran anything they wanted,” Bee told TechCrunch.

The researchers gave TechCrunch proof-of-concept code to test the bug for ourselves. The code allowed any app to run at the same level of privileges as the logged-in user. In this case, the researchers popped open the Windows calculator — the go-to app for hackers to show they can run code remotely on an affected computer.

But worse, a hacker could send malicious PowerShell commands, an [in-built app often used by attackers](https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/23/why-the-wikileaks-cia-dump-was-the-most-damaging-one-yet/) to download additional malicious components and install ransomware.

Bee said a malicious link could be sent as an email or listed on a webpage, but could also be triggered if the malicious code was combined with a cross-site scripting exploit that ran automatically in the browser.

It was also possible to steal a user’s account access token using a single line of code, allowing a hacker to gain access to a user’s account without needing their password.

Origin’s macOS client wasn’t affected by the bug.

EA spokesperson John Reseburg confirmed a fix was rolled out Monday. TechCrunch confirmed the code no longer worked following the update.

Published on April 17, 2019

EA rolled out a new update for Origin earlier this week to plug a security breach.

Origin, like many popular apps, uses a unique URL (origin://) to allow web pages to open corresponding content in the client itself. This is used to direct users to game store pages and so on, so long as they have the Origin Windows client installed.

Unfortunately, EA's implementation contained a flaw that would allow hackers to fool Origin intro running malicious code. All the victim needs to do is click an Origin link.

[![](https://assets.vg247.com/current//2019/04/origin_logo_wide_1.jpg)](https://assets.vg247.com/current//2019/04/origin_logo_wide_1.jpg)

This flaw was brought to light by researches Daley Bee, and Dominik Penner, who provided [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/ea-origin-bug-exposed-hackers/) with a proof-of-concept code. According to the site, the code could also be used to launch Windows PowerShell, which is often used to install ransomware.

The good news is that EA fixed the issue in a hotfix released on Monday, so make sure your Origin client is updated.

This is actually Origin's second security snafu in recent memory. In November last year, EA fixed a bug that allowed hackers [access to users' account settings](https://www.vg247.com/ea-origin-auto-login-url-bug-fixed).

## In This Article

* Scroll to section

**EA’s PC client, Origin, has been popular of late. The runaway success of Apex Legends and big releases like Anthem has seen players jumping in to Origin with aplomb. However, a security vulnerability could be putting users at risk.** Daley Bee and Dominik Penner of Underdog Security (via [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/ea-origin-bug-exposed-hackers/)) have found a flaw that can let malicious actors run or install applications on the PC without users permissions, through something as innocent as a hyperlink.

As with the recent [Internet Explorer flaw](https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/new-ie-flaw-lets-hackers-still-data-even-dont-launch-3696475), this doesn’t require you to even open Origin, you just need to have it installed. This is due to the way EA uses a custom URL protocol to access the web store of individual games through a browser using the Origin:// protocol.

**Related:** [**Best Android Phones**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-android-phones-3438996)However, it turns out that Origin can be tricked, and this could allow internet-dwelling bad guys to install programs onto an end user’s PC without them even knowing.

EA has fixed the exploit now, so, Windows users, you can fix it right now. Stop reading, go to Origin and update it. Problem solved. For those of you reading along on the Mac, congratulations, you get a pass this time. The exploit only affects Windows users.

As a demonstration, Bee showed off an exploit that shows up the Windows Calculator application, disguised as an EA sales offer, showing how easily users could be taken advantage of.

**Related:** [**Best FPS Games**](https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-fps-games-3526310)Our advice is the same as always for big exploits: be careful what you click and keep all of your applications updated. This is a worrying exploit to see in the wild, and it’s unsure whether it was used to get to users, but it’s serious enough that you should definitely be updating your Origin client posthaste. Doctors orders.

**Use Origin? You could get hold of us on Twitter at @TrustedReviews, or you could go and update your Origin. I’d recommend the Origin update first, honestly.**

Electronic Arts’ PC gaming platform, Origin has been found to have a security vulnerability that allows hackers to trick users of the service into opening and running malicious software on their system.

EA’s answer to the popular [Steam](https://www.techradar.com/tag/steam) and Epic storefronts is used to launch the publisher’s own gaming titles such as [Apex Legends](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/apex-legends-review) and [Anthem](https://www.techradar.com/reviews/anthem), but researchers from [Underdog Security](https://underdogsecurity.com/) found a loophole in the Windows version of the client – installed by tens of millions of gamers.

As reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/ea-origin-bug-exposed-hackers/), it was possible to trick the desktop app to run any program on the user’s computer when clicking on a custom link, which in turn could allow hackers to run certain commands on their system and download malicious programs such as malware.

What’s more, the link doesn’t even need to be explicitly clicked on for the Origin client to execute it, with the ability of a script to open the problematic link when a user visits another unrelated page.

Thankfully, EA released a patch that successfully addresses the exploit on Monday, but users of the service are recommended to check they’re running the latest version. Mac users can breathe easy as the vulnerability never affected that version of the client.

# EA Origin Users, Update Your Client Now

Between [Anthem](https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964), [multiple](https://kotaku.com/eas-australian-studio-hit-by-massive-layoffs-1832803802) [rounds of layoffs](https://kotaku.com/ea-lays-off-350-people-in-marketing-publishing-analyt-1833575289), and [all the trouble](https://kotaku.com/ea-cancels-open-world-star-wars-game-1831786371) the publisher has had with various Star Wars games recently, EA has had a pretty rocky last 12 months. But strangely, a recent bug with its Origin game client might be one of the company’s most serious issues yet.

That’s because due to a security flaw in the Windows version of Origin, it was possible for hackers to essentially run or install any application on a user’s computer through something as innocuous as a hyperlink.

Discovered by Daley Bee and Dominik Penner of [Underdog Security](https://underdogsecurity.com/) (via TechCrunch), the source of the flaw came from EA’s use of a custom URL protocol that allowed gamers to access a game’s web store from a browser instead of using the Origin client. Unfortunately, because those “origin://” links could also be tricked into launching malicious software, it essentially gave hackers free rein to install almost any program onto an end user’s machine.

According to Bee, by combining a malicious code with a cross-site scripting exploit, malware could be sent and automatically installed on vulnerable systems simply by clicking a link. And to prove the existence of the flaw, the team at Underdog security even created a [demo exploit](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/origin-pop-calc.gif) that opened up the Windows Calculator app instead of a link in Origin that appeared to be an EA sales offer.

Thankfully, the exploit has been addressed in the most recent patch for Origin, so to fix the issue, all you have to do is update your Origin game client. For any Origin client users on Mac, the good news is that the issue apparently only affected the Windows version of Origin. But there’s no reason you shouldn’t keep your software updated.

And while it’s unclear if any users were actually attacked using the flaw, just the presence of an exploit this serious in Origin is still a bit of a worry. Maybe EA should worry less about microtransactions and focus more on QA, as it seems both Origin and Anthem have been in need of some additional technical help.

HACK ATTACK
# Sims 4, Battlefield and Fifa players’ computers could be taken over by hackers

* [Alex Sassoon Coby](https://www.thesun.co.uk/author/asassooncoby/ "Posts by Alex Sassoon Coby")

A MAJOR security flaw has been found in the Origin launcher that you have to install to be able to run EA games on your PC.

Tens of millions of people have the software installed, and you could be at risk even if you haven't used it for years.

![ Anyone who has ever played The Sims 4 is at risk if they have not updated Origin this week](https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/NINTCHDBPICT000120440239.jpg?strip=all&w=960)2

Anyone who has Origin installed could have their computer taken over by hackers, be exposed to ransomware or just have all their personal information compromised.

As reported by [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/ea-origin-bug-exposed-hackers/), the flaw could also allow a hacker to gain access to your EA account without even needing to go to the trouble of stealing your password.

“An attacker could’ve ran anything they wanted,” security researcher Daley Bee told the tech blog.

The flaw was revealed after being fixed in a patch that rolled out yesterday, but still affects anyone running an older version of the software.

Potential victims include those who may have installed games using Origin in the past, even if they no longer actively use the software to run games.

Origin, normally used to run, buy and download games, is required by EA to play many of their games on PC, and was first launched in 2012.

The bug worked by exploiting the way the app is set to automatically open links some from the web that claim to be directed at something in the app, such as a product page in the built-in store.

This feature meant Origin could then be tricked into opening and running anything on your computer just by clicking that link.

This includes launching built-in Windows tools, and potentially setting them to automatically download and run malicious software.

The researchers point out that users would not even need to click on a link to be affected as attackers could use another tool in their nefarious arsenal to open it automatically if you simply visited a web page on which it had been placed.
