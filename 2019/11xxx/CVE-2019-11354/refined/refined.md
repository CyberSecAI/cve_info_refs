Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, related to CVE-2019-11354:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Origin client for Windows used a custom URL scheme (`origin://`) to allow web pages to open corresponding content within the client (e.g., game store pages).
*   The implementation of this URL scheme had a flaw that allowed the client to be tricked into running arbitrary code from these links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary vulnerability was that the Origin client could be forced to execute arbitrary code by simply clicking a specially crafted `origin://` link. This allowed an attacker to run any application on the user's computer.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The client didn't properly validate the input from the custom URL scheme, which allowed malicious commands to be injected.
*   **Account Token Theft:**  It was also possible to steal a user's account access token using a single line of code through the same vulnerability, which would allow a hacker to gain full account access without needing a password.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute any code on the victim's machine with the same level of privileges as the logged-in user.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers could use this vulnerability to install malware, ransomware, or other malicious software.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers could steal user's access tokens, gaining access to their Origin accounts without needing passwords.
*   **Data Theft:**  Attackers could potentially steal data, access personal information or do other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:**  Attackers could send malicious `origin://` links via email, instant messages, or list them on web pages.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The malicious links could be combined with XSS exploits to automatically trigger the vulnerability when a user visited a compromised web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** Attackers needed to understand how to exploit the custom URL scheme in the Origin client.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:**  They needed the ability to create malicious `origin://` links designed to execute code or steal tokens.
*   **Distribution of Malicious Links:** Attackers needed to find ways to distribute the malicious links or inject them into web pages for victims to interact with.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affected only the Windows version of the Origin client; the macOS client was not vulnerable.
*   EA released a patch to fix the vulnerability on Monday of the week the issue was made public.
*   The articles emphasize the need for users to update the Origin client to protect themselves.
*   Some articles note that this was not the first security issue with Origin, referencing a previous bug that allowed hackers to access user account settings.
