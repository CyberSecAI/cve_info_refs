Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11784:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a missing access control check within the mail module (notifications) of Odoo. Specifically, it lacks proper authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is the absence of sufficient checks to ensure that users can only access messages in conversations they are authorized to view.
- **Missing Authorization:** The system fails to verify a user's membership or access rights to a conversation before granting access to the messages within it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Private Conversations:** A remote authenticated user can gain access to private messages within conversations they were not originally part of. This allows them to read sensitive communications.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The vulnerability leads to a breach of confidentiality, as private discussions become accessible to unauthorized individuals.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
- **Specially Crafted Requests:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specifically crafted requests to the Odoo server.
- **Portal Access:** A user with portal access can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
