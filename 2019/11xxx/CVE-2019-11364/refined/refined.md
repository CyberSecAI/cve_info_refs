The provided content relates to CVE-2019-11364.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Inadequate input validation around user and group data allowed an authenticated administrator-level user to manipulate SQL queries, potentially changing their intended meaning.
*   **OS Command Injection:** Inadequate input validation in the "Disk Manager" component allowed an authenticated administrator-level user to execute arbitrary root-level commands through crafted input variables.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Inadequate input validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in both the SQL query construction and OS command execution contexts.
*   **Incorrect sanitization module:** The incorrect sanitization module ("small text" rather than "small string") was used for user/group data.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **SQL Injection:** An attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database or even modify database records.
*  **OS Command Injection:** An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Web interface:**  The vulnerabilities are accessible via the Snare Server's web-based user interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level privileges within the Snare Central application.
*  **Web access:** The attacker must be able to access the web interface to exploit the vulnerabilities.

**Additional details:**
* The fix involved linking the "small text" and "small string" sanitization modules as synonyms and implementing additional protections in the generic sanitization component.
* The fix also included generic and specific protections around OS binary execution.
* The CVSSv3 score is noted to be comparatively low due to the requirement for administrator-level access, which already grants substantial access to the underlying system.
* The security issue was discovered and reported by Simone Quatrini of Pen Test Partners in the UK.
