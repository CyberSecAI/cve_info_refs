Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11251:

*   **Vulnerability:** The `kubectl cp` command in Kubernetes versions 1.1-1.12, and versions prior to 1.13.11, 1.14.7, and 1.15.4 is vulnerable to a symlink attack.

*   **Root Cause:** A combination of two symlinks provided by the tar output of a malicious container can be used to place a file outside of the destination directory specified in the `kubectl cp` invocation.

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker can create a malicious container with specific symlinks. When a user attempts to copy files from this container using `kubectl cp`, the symlinks can redirect the file copy operation to a location outside the intended destination.

*   **Impact:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to place a nefarious file outside of the destination tree, potentially leading to unauthorized access or code execution.

*   **Affected Versions:**

    *   v1.13.10
    *   v1.14.6
    *   v1.15.3
*   **Fix:**

    *   In v1.16.0, symlink support in `kubectl cp` was removed. Users are advised to use a combination of `exec` and `tar` instead.
    *   In v1.15.4, v1.14.7, and v1.13.11, the `kubectl cp` un-tar symlink logic was changed to unpack symlinks after all regular files, preventing files from being written through symlinks.
