## Description

![@liggitt](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/980082?u=e6d3a90de563c894207290d21eb6987a1d45391a&v=4&size=48)[liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt)opened [on Feb 3, 2020](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/87773#issue-559146411)

A security issue was discovered in kubectl versions v1.13.10, v1.14.6, and v1.15.3. The issue is of a medium severity and upgrading of kubectl is encouraged to fix the vulnerability.

**Am I vulnerable?**

Run kubectl version --client and if it returns versions v1.13.10, v1.14.6, and v1.15.3, you are running a vulnerable version.

**How do I upgrade?**

Follow installation instructions [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)

**Vulnerability Details**

The details for this vulnerability are very similar to [CVE-2019-1002101](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-34jx-wx69-9x8v "CVE-2019-1002101") and [CVE-2019-11246](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8wj5-gvvw-f5fh "CVE-2019-11246").

A vulnerability has been discovered in kubectl cp that allows a combination of two symlinks to copy a file outside of its destination directory. This could be used to allow an attacker to place a nefarious file using a symlink, outside of the destination tree.

This issue is filed as [CVE-2019-11251](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6qfg-8799-r575 "CVE-2019-11251").

Two fixes were formulated, one fix to remove symlink support going forwards and a fix with cherry picks made to ensure backwards compatibility.

See [#82143](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82143) for the primary fix in v1.16.0 which removes the support of symlinks in kubectl cp. After version 1.16.0, symlink support with kubectl cp is removed, it is recommended instead to use a combination of exec+tar.

A second fix has been made to 1.15.4 and backported to 1.14.7 and 1.13.11. This changes the kubectl cp un-tar symlink logic, by unpacking the symlinks after all the regular files have been unpacked. This then guarantees that a file can’t be written through a symlink.

See [#82384](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82384) for the fix to version 1.15.4. The following Cherry picks were made from this fix to earlier versions of v1.14.7 and v1.13.11:

See [#82502](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82502) for version 1.14.7

See [#82503](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82503) for version 1.13.11

Thank you to Erik Sjölund ([@eriksjolund](https://github.com/eriksjolund)) for discovering this issue, Tim Allclair and Maciej Szulik for both fixes and the patch release managers for including the fix in their releases.

## Description

The Kubernetes kubectl cp command in versions 1.1-1.12, and versions prior to 1.13.11, 1.14.7, and 1.15.4 allows a combination of two symlinks provided by tar output of a malicious container to place a file outside of the destination directory specified in the kubectl cp invocation. This could be used to allow an attacker to place a nefarious file using a symlink, outside of the destination tree.

More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Right now the test will assume that when cloudcfg.sh returns the container is up and running. We need to wait until the container is actually running.

A security issue was discovered in kubectl versions v1.13.10, v1.14.6, and v1.15.3. The issue is of a medium severity and upgrading of kubectl is encouraged to fix the vulnerability.
Am I vulnerable?
Run `kubectl version --client` and if it returns versions v1.13.10, v1.14.6, and v1.15.3, you are running a vulnerable version.
How do I upgrade?
Follow installation instructions here <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>

Not all instructions will provide up-to-date kubectl versions at the time of this announcement. So, always confirm with `kubectl version --client`.

Vulnerability Details
The details for this vulnerability are very similar to CVE-2019-1002101 and  CVE-2019-11246.
A vulnerability has been discovered in `kubectl cp` that allows a combination of two  symlinks to copy a file outside of its destination directory. This could be used to allow an attacker to place a netfarious file using a symlink, outside of the destination tree.
This issue is filed as CVE-2019-11251 .
Two fixes were formulated, one fix to remove symlink support going forwards and a fix with cherry picks made to ensure backwards compatibility.

See <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82143> for main fix in v1.16.0 which removes the support of symlinks in kubectl cp. After version 1.16.0, symlink support with `kubectl cp` is removed, it is recommended instead to use a combination of exec+tar.

A second fix has been made to 1.15.4 and backported to 1.14.7 and 1.13.11. This changes the` kubectl cp` un-tar symlink logic, by unpacking the symlinks after all the regular files have been unpacked. This then guarantees that a file can't be written through a symlink.

See <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82384> for the fix to version 1.15.4. The following Cherry picks were made from this fix to earlier versions of v1.14.7 and v1.13.11:

See <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82502> for version 1.14.7
See <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82503> for version 1.13.11

Thank you to Erik Sjölund for discovering this issue, Tim Allclair and Maciej Szulik for both fixes and the patch release managers for including the fix in their releases.
Thank You,
Luke Hinds on behalf of the Kubernetes Product Security Committee

### @soltysh **[soltysh](/soltysh)** commented [Aug 29, 2019](#issue-487141745) • edited by liggitt Loading

**What type of PR is this?**

/kind cleanup

**What this PR does / why we need it**:

Based on the recent discussion in SIG-CLI we've decided to drop support when copying data from pods.

**Special notes for your reviewer**:

/assign [@liggitt](https://github.com/liggitt) [@tallclair](https://github.com/tallclair)

Only the second commit matters, the first is coming from [#82087](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/82087)

Fixes [#87773](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/87773)

**Does this PR introduce a user-facing change?**:

```
`kubectl cp` no longer supports copying symbolic links from containers; to support this use case, see `kubectl exec --help` for examples using `tar` directly

```

Sorry, something went wrong.

rather than holding a pointer to the command, consider storing the name of the parent command here (e.g. `o.ExecParentCmdName = cmd.Parent().Name()`

then, make the hint about using exec condition on ExecParentCmdName being non-empty. that way, CopyOptions stays reusable

this should refer users to help describing *how* to use exec for symlink support... it is not immediately obvious how you would do that (even just `see cp command help for details`)

nit: this is verbose for an error that might be printed a bunch of times. Maybe simplify it to something like:

Suggested change

|  | fmt.Fprintf(o.IOStreams.ErrOut, "warning: file %q is a symlink, skipping (consider using %s exec for symlink support)\n", destFileName, o.cmd.Parent().Name()) |
| --- | --- |
|  | fmt.Fprintf(o.IOStreams.ErrOut, "skipping symlink: %q -> %q\n", destFileName, linkTarget) |

I'd tend to agree. the pointer to exec can be printed just once

This continue makes no difference, so I think it should be omitted.

Another alternative (my personal favorite) would be to remove the `else` and keep the `continue` to make the code path even cleaner and easier to read.

I think `o.cmd` can be `nil` in some of the tests, as the `o.Complete` func that sets `cmd` isn't executed in all of them. The applies to at least `TestTarUntar`.
