Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11749:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content is directly related to CVE-2019-11749. This is evidenced by the bug report in Bugzilla which is explicitly labeled with the CVE ID, as well as the inclusion of this CVE in various advisories.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies within the WebRTC implementation of `getUserMedia`.  The API had a flaw where it could reveal device properties of cameras without triggering a user prompt or notification. Malicious web content could exploit this by using constraints within the `getUserMedia` API.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of proper constraint handling:** The vulnerability stems from a weakness in how `getUserMedia` constraints are handled when probing for camera capabilities, specifically, not clearing the constraints that might be used for fingerprinting.

*   **Information disclosure:** The core weakness is the ability to reveal camera properties without any user interaction or notification.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Fingerprinting:** Malicious web content could use the vulnerability to collect camera device properties and create a fingerprint of the user's system.
*   **Privacy violation:** The ability to identify users through their camera characteristics allows for a privacy breach.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious web content:** The vulnerability is exploited through JavaScript code embedded within a website.
*   **`getUserMedia` API:** The vulnerability leverages the `getUserMedia` API to probe camera capabilities.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to run JavaScript code:** The attacker needs to be able to run malicious JavaScript on the victim's browser.
*   **No special privileges:** The attack doesn't need any special permissions. It is all done via the web API that's normally available to web pages.

**Additional Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability was found while debugging a crash in `mozilla::ReduceConstraint` which was caused by a different issue regarding how `MediaStreamTrack::GetConstraints()` was returning values.
*   The code for reducing the constraints was meant to keep the mediaSource and ignore all other constraints. However, the implementation using `SetAsMediaTrackConstraints` was flawed, and didn't actually reset other values, making the reduction a no-op, and allowing the original constraints to go through.
*   A fix was implemented to properly clear/reduce the constraints by using `Value()` instead of `Construct()`.
*   The test suite was improved to include more robust tests, including comparisons of requested vs actual constraints. It is suggested to use impossible constraint values to detect issues.

In summary, CVE-2019-11749 allows for the fingerprinting of users through their camera properties, without triggering the userâ€™s consent prompts by using the getUserMedia API's constraints.
