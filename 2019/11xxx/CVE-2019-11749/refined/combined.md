This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c0)• 6 years ago |
|  | |

This is to record reasons to accelerate landing of feature policy, and to consider putting `getUserMedia` behind a user gesture, at least in deep link navigation cases where permission has been persisted.

In light of the recent [Zoom exploit](https://medium.com/%40jonathan.leitschuh/zoom-zero-day-4-million-webcams-maybe-an-rce-just-get-them-to-visit-your-website-ac75c83f4ef5), it's prudent to review our camera & microphone permission handling. The zoom exploit allowed any web site—even third-party banner ads—to launch a user's installed zoom client into an attacker-created room with the user's camera and microphone turned on. It could do this from a background tab, at any time of the attacker’s choosing. The attacker could then record the user (or their environment if the user isn't present atm).

Firefox fares better than Zoom, not allowing this by default, but is not 100% free of similar issues.

A web-equivalent exploit would be a site or iframe (banner ad) navigating to an attacker-created room on a well-known already-trusted WebRTC site, using a deep link. In Firefox, "already-trusted" means the user has previously checked `☑ Remember this decision` in the gUM prompt at the well-known WebRTC site. It's worth looking at the third party (banner ad) and first-party cases separately:

In the first-party case, the exploit merely requires the trusted WebRTC site to start the call immediately and without interaction, which [many do](https://appear.in/media-test) (but again, relies on you having used the well-known site before and having granted it persistent permission in the past).

In the third-party case, the exploit additionally requires a user-trusted WebRTC service shady enough to allow itself to be iframed (not using [CSP to prevent this](https://jan-ivar.github.io/dummy/iframe_appear_cross.html)).

The good news is Firefox:

* does not persist camera & microphone permissions by default (opt in)
* does not grant gUM access to background tabs (waits for focus)
* Once feature policy lands (soon) iframes (banner ads) will be blocked from gUM access by default.

The bad news is Firefox:

* allows gUM access on pageload—doesn't gate `getUserMedia` behind a user gesture.
* feature policy hasn't landed yet.

This means that if a Firefox user has selected `☑ Remember this decision` in the gUM prompt for a well-known WebRTC site, then they are vulnerable from this exploit. Once feature policy lands, it takes care of the third-party case, leaving the first-party case.

Complications: A problem with always requiring a user gesture would be that in the Firefox permission model, it leaves Firefox users with two clicks instead of one to enter a room, compared with Chrome. For example: Today, you click on a link a friend sent you over DM, you see a Firefox permission prompt asking for camera & mic permission for the well-known WebRTC site, you click "Allow", and you're in. Requiring a user gesture would mean a second (in-content) click to enter. Maybe we only require it if permission is persisted?

To clarify the need for feature policy, I think we consider third party sites being able to do this as more indefensible than first-party sites doing it.

There are some legitimate use-cases for first-party sites being allowed to do this (jump into room links), but none for third party sites.

Personally I would be hesitant to introduce a user gesture for this permission. It already has excellent response metrics and we would probably break a lot of sites.

In [bug 1565574](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565574 "VERIFIED FIXED - 'Always allow' for external protocol / scheme handling should be a per-origin permission") we landed on "remember this decision should be double keyed by origin + app", which is the equivalent of what we have for WebRTC already (it's already keyed by origin, but we don't need an app).

At some point we just have to offload the security aspect of this to websites, and I think we're in a reasonable state for WebRTC.

An example of the [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/frame-ancestors) mitigation for sites mentioned above would be:

```
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'none';

Attached file
[iframe\_jitsi\_cross.html](attachment.cgi?id=9083434)
— [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9083434&action=edit)

A demo iframing Jitsi. Putting it here to refer to and test with.

Chrome considers this a request from the top-level origin (`bugzilla.mozilla.org`) for persistent permission and name in prompt, whereas

Firefox considers this a request from the iframe origin (`meet.jit.si`) with regard to persistent permission and name in prompt.

Problems:

1. A Firefox user who's used jitsi in the past with persisted permission would be vulnerable to a malicious site getting the camera and microphone this way, if not for the fact that jitsi appears to disable the camera and microphone by default in this case, a mitigation on their part.
2. (To the extent people read text in prompts) Firefox's permission prompt is confusing.

Importantly, this is a problem ***even with feature policy enabled***, since the top-level domain is the attacker and can add the `allow="camera;microphone"` to a hidden iframe. We should open a bug if we don't have one to fix our permissions like I explain in [w3c/permissions#185](https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues/185) which appears to be how Chrome works now.

I've tested several common WebRTC sites, and most of them have a “Ready to join?” button, even with deep links. The exceptions so far are [appear.in](https://jan-ivar.github.io/dummy/iframe_appear_cross.html) (which prevents iframing 👍) and jitsi (which does not, but appears to turn off cam/mic by default in this case 👍).

Still looking for a bad apple to test with, since one is all it takes, though it helps that it can't be too obscure in order to be an effective hack.

I think a short-term upliftable minimal fix would be to ignore persisted permissions when invoked from iframes.

Johann, would you be able to write a patch for this or point me in the right direction? Looks like this would need to be done in WebrtcUI.jsm (desktop)?

Thanks for doing a patch!

> Importantly, this is a problem even with feature policy enabled, since the top-level domain is the attacker and can add the allow="camera;microphone" to a hidden iframe. We should open a bug if we don't have one to fix our permissions like I explain in [w3c/permissions#185](https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues/185) which appears to be how Chrome works now.

That GitHub thread seems to conflict with how we want to build our permission model alongside feature policy. With our update, no third party origin will request permission anymore, any permission request will always come from the first party, which then may decide to choose how to distribute the permission. Thus, there will not be two doorhangers or anything, if the first party has access any embeddee may have access if the first party deems it acceptable. Otherwise their permission requests will be blocked outright.

With feature policy, what you describe in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access") isn't our problem anymore. If the user decides to give trust to the first party then there's hardly anything we can do to prevent said part to share the user's camera data with third parties anyway. The site could just stream the keyframes via postMessage or simply send the data directly to the server of the third party.

Feature policy is explicitly an opt-in feature for websites to add security by restricting their embedded third parties, and only passively helps users by simplifying our permission model.

How? What "update" are you referring to? On nightly, where I believe feature policy is already enabled, I still see *"Will you share cam & mic with meet.jit.si"* in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access").

I believe the [github thread](https://github.com/w3c/permissions/issues/185) is describing the same goal you describe: that end-users see all requests as coming from the top-level site only. If that's what you mean by *"no third party origin will request permission anymore"*, then I agree. But as an implementation comment, I'm not following who's code will need to deal with [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access"). There's no MediaManager patch coming to have a top-level document ask for gum permissions on behalf of an iframe.

Clearly third parties will still request *camera and microphone* through `getUserMedia`. In the specs—which is what the github thread concerns—[getUserMedia](https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/getusermedia.html#dom-mediadevices-getusermedia) calls [request permission to use](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#requesting-more-permission) in step 6.3.5. This means that the latter algorithm's *"realm and other realms with the same origin."* is referring to the document, realm and origin of the *iframe*, not the top-level document. That's where it finds the [policy controlled feature](https://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/#policy-controlled-feature) in [permission state](https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#permission-state). I would similarly expect our permission code to handle this. That's why I reopened the github issue to allow persisting to the granting origin.

> Thus, there will not be two doorhangers or anything, if the first party has access any embeddee may have access if the first party deems it acceptable. Otherwise their permission requests will be blocked outright.

Agreed.

> With feature policy, what you describe in [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access") isn't our problem anymore.

The site could just stream the keyframes via postMessage or simply send the data directly to the server of the third party.

Agreed once we fix our permission prompt to name the top-level domain, and persist permission to the top-level domain instead of the iframe's.

Please let me know if this matches your understanding, or if I'm off track.

The new permission model ("updating" our handling of permission requests for iframes) is not a part of feature policy, it just requires feature policy to work properly. So FP is implemented but the permission changes are still pending (lack of resources).

I admit that in terms of code there will still be a time when a third-party principal initiates a permission request. My main point is that for **persistent** permissions, with feature policy we will never check those for the third party origin and always for the first party. The attack you describe here is based on persistent permissions and thus feature policy will, completely, prevent it.

> Agreed once we fix our permission prompt to name the top-level domain, and persist permission to the top-level domain instead of the iframe's.

Yup, that's the plan :)

Looking forward to those. Do you have a bug #?

Note sites like <https://jitsi.org/> appear to have legitimate partners iframing them. Once this patch here lands, end-users of their services will be stuck with no way to persist camera and microphone permission on desktop until those permission changes are made.

* **User impact if declined**: If there's just one vulnerable semi-popular room-based WebRTC site out there that allows itself to be iframed AND throws its users into meetings using deep-links with persisted camera/mic on, without gating them on some "Join meeting" button, THEN the following exploit seems doable (so far the only vulnerable site we've identified, Jitsi, has added mitigations by joining users without camera/mic on in this case, but we haven't done an extensive search. Many other sites like appear.in typically use CSP to prevent iframing, and are not affected. But there may be product reasons why a site allows iframing. See [comment 4](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c4 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access")).

The exploit is that any web site—even an iframed third-party banner ad, could embed the vulnerable site in a hidden iframe away from view, and specify an attacker's room in the URL. This could connect a victim's system to an attacker's room without their knowledge, potentially enabling the attacker to spy on the victim using camera or microphone or both. There might not be any hardware light indication if only microphone is used.

Victims vulnerable to this unprompted snooping are limited to users who have previously checked `☑ Remember this decision` in the permission prompt in a previous visit to the vulnerable site.

There's a potentially larger pool of vulnerable users who've never visited the vulnerable site, who may get a prompted, but be confused since the wrong domain is listed in the permission prompt, and accept it for that reason, but in my view that risk is less severe, since such an exploit would probably be spotted pretty quickly.

* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The risk is low because the patch is simple. It simply disables persistent permissions in cross-origin (third-party) iframes.

There's some backlash risk in the sense that legitimate end-users of WebRTC services embedded in iframes (e.g. Jitsi partners—not Jitsi itself) will now be prompted by Firefox for camera and microphone every time on desktop, and no longer be able to persist their camera and mic permissions in Firefox for that site (this matches Firefox for Android today where we never persist camera and microphone). Fixing this requires more work in the future (see [comment 11](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c11 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access")).

* **String changes made/needed**: None

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: See above.
* **User impact if declined**: See above.
* **Fix Landed on Version**:
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: See above.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**: None

This doesn't seem to warrant a dot release AFAICT?

I only marked it "leave open" since [comment 0](/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588#c0 "VERIFIED FIXED - Deep-linking to attacker-created rooms on already-trusted WebRTC sites may give unprompted camera/mic access") mentions two ways to deeplink into attacker rooms, 1) from top-level domain solely through navigating to a vulnerable WebRTC site with attacker-room in URL without the user's intent, and 2) from embedded iframe that does so on the sly, maybe even visually hiding that this is taking place.

Since I gather the risk profiles are quite different, I'm happy to open a new issue on the former, so we can close this out.

> This doesn't seem to warrant a dot release AFAICT?

Since jitsi has added a mitigation on their servers, I don't know of another WebRTC site at the moment that is vulnerable. But I didn't do an extensive search, so that doesn't mean there isn't one (or that someone couldn't build one). I tested hangouts, Google meet, talky.io, appear.in, and jitsi. I did NOT test Facebook or webex for instance (I'm on PTO now, if someone wants to do that).

If we don't do a dot release I think we need to ask the person outside of Mozilla to hold off blogging about it until 69 becomes release.

Even without an identified exploit, I'd predict the potential press around this might be negative, given how [last month's](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=zoom+camera+exploit&t=fpas&ia=web) *non-technical* press (e.g. Fortune) seemed more upset about the privacy implications than over zoom's RCE (!)

Here's an STR:

1. Open <https://meet.jit.si/test123456> in a new tab
2. When prompted for camera and microphone, check "Remember this decision" and approve (you can leave this tab open for full effect)
3. Open [attachment 9083434](/attachment.cgi?id=9083434 "iframe_jitsi_cross.html") [[details]](/attachment.cgi?id=9083434&action=edit "iframe_jitsi_cross.html") in a new tab (jib's manual test page attached to this bug)
4. Enable camera through jitsi's UI in the attachment's iframe

Expected pre-patch:

Camera turns on and transmits your face to the other tab you have open D:

Expected post-patch:

A permission prompt with no "Remember this decision" checkbox available

I have reproduced the issue in Nightly v70.0a1 from 2019-08-08 and verified it in Nightly v70.0a1 from 2019-08-10 and Nightly v70.0a1 from 2019-08-18 and Beta v69.0b14 and Firefox ESR v68.1.0esr build ID: 20190816215911 on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 18.04.

The permission prompt with no "Remember this decision" checkbox is displayed after opening the video on the second "in frame" jitsi test page.

# CVE-2019-11748

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11747.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11749.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11748 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11748)

#### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

# CVE-2019-11747

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2019-11746.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2019-11748.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2019-11747 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11747)

#### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an http: URL rather than secure https: they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-25

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 69

Announced
September 3, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 69

#### [#CVE-2019-11751: Malicious code execution through command line parameters](#CVE-2019-11751)

Reporter
Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
Impact
critical
##### Description

Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1564449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564449)

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

#### [#CVE-2019-11742: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images](#CVE-2019-11742)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

* [Bug 1559715](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715)

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

#### [#CVE-2019-11741: Isolate addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com](#CVE-2019-11741)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised sandboxed content process can perform a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack on content from any site it can cause to be loaded in the same process. Because `addons.mozilla.org` and `accounts.firefox.com` have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process.

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

#### [#CVE-2019-11747: 'Forget about this site' removes sites from pre-loaded HSTS list](#CVE-2019-11747)

Reporter
Thomas Henlich
Impact
low
##### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an `http:` URL rather than secure `https:` they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

# Mozilla Foundation Security Advisory 2019-26

## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox ESR 68.1

Announced
September 3, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox ESR
Fixed in

* Firefox ESR 68.1

#### [#CVE-2019-11751: Malicious code execution through command line parameters](#CVE-2019-11751)

Reporter
Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
Impact
critical
##### Description

Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

* [Bug 1572838](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1572838)

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1564449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564449)

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

* [Bug 1562033](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033)

#### [#CVE-2019-11742: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images](#CVE-2019-11742)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

##### References

* [Bug 1559715](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715)

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1551913](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1551913)
* [Bug 1552206](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1552206)

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11752: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11752)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1501152](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152)

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

##### References

* [Bug 1564588](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588)

#### [#CVE-2019-11749: Camera information available without prompting using getUserMedia](#CVE-2019-11749)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

##### References

* [Bug 1565374](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565374)

#### [#CVE-2019-11750: Type confusion in Spidermonkey](#CVE-2019-11750)

Reporter
Qixun Zhao of Qihoo 360 Vulcan Team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A type confusion vulnerability exists in Spidermonkey, which results in a non-exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1568397](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397)

#### [#CVE-2019-11738: Content security policy bypass through hash-based sources in directives](#CVE-2019-11738)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
low
##### Description

If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any `javascript:` URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions.

##### References

* [Bug 1452037](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452037)

#### [#CVE-2019-11747: 'Forget about this site' removes sites from pre-loaded HSTS list](#CVE-2019-11747)

Reporter
Thomas Henlich
Impact
low
##### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an `http:` URL rather than secure `https:` they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Mikhail Gavrilov, Tyson Smith, Marcia Knous, Tom Ritter, Philipp, and Bob Owens reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 68 and Firefox ESR 68. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565374#c0)• 6 years ago |
|  | |

Found through [bug 1565317](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565317 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in [@ mozilla::ReduceConstraint]") really, which was caused by [bug 1560907](/show_bug.cgi?id=1560907 "RESOLVED FIXED - MediaStreamTrack::GetConstraints() returns {mediaSource: \"camera\"} for all tracks where it should be empty").

Prior to [bug 1560907](/show_bug.cgi?id=1560907 "RESOLVED FIXED - MediaStreamTrack::GetConstraints() returns {mediaSource: \"camera\"} for all tracks where it should be empty") code for reducing a set of constraints looked [like this](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/15be167a5b436b57fef944b84eef061d24c1af8c/dom/media/MediaManager.cpp#2286-2295):

```
  // It looks like {audio: true}, do nothing.
  if (!aConstraint.IsMediaTrackConstraints()) {
    return;
  }

  // Keep mediaSource, ignore all other constraints.
  auto& c = aConstraint.GetAsMediaTrackConstraints();
  MOZ_DIAGNOSTIC_ASSERT(c.mMediaSource.WasPassed());
  nsString mediaSource = c.mMediaSource.Value();
  aConstraint.SetAsMediaTrackConstraints().mMediaSource.Construct(mediaSource);

```

But since `aConstraint` is already a `MediaTrackConstraints`, `SetAsMediaTrackConstraints()` [does not Uninit and reset its values](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/__GENERATED__/dom/bindings/MediaStreamBinding.cpp#124). The reduction is basically a no-op.

Thanks for catching this!

When we fix this, we should improve the [test](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/tests/mochitest/test_fingerprinting_resistance.html) to catch this.

Two ways to test it:

1. Compare `track.getConstraints()` against passed-in constraints
2. Check for an impossible constraint (Thanks Andreas!) E.g. `{video: {width: {min: 9999}}}`

As a side-note: About (1) perhaps we shouldn't make it so easy to detect that fingerprinting anti-measures are present? But that's for a follow-up issue perhaps.

Andreas, what do you wanna do about the review in [bug 1565317](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565317 "RESOLVED FIXED - Crash in [@ mozilla::ReduceConstraint]")? My review comment is the `Construct` will fail because the value is already there, but I suspect you already know that. 😉

Missed that actually. I'll just swap it to use Value() instead of Construct() so it can land. Otherwise the crash stays out there for longer.

Do we need sec review to land this? I'm not seeing a sec rating. I'd consider this `sec-moderate` fwiw.

Given that this is sec-moderate, I'm thinking we don't need to bother uplifting this to ESR60 given that it's nearing the end of its life cycle. That said, do we want this on Beta and ESR68? If so, please nominate :)

[Bug 1565374](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565374 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fingerprinting resistance against getUserMedia constraints doesn't work") - Reset state. r?jib

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: Scripts may use probing techniques (e.g. [bug 1528056](/show_bug.cgi?id=1528056 "NEW - Mitigate OverconstrainedError fingerprinting exploits that use always-failing constraints."))—that don't incur a user prompt—on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system, adding bits to a fingerprint of the user's system, even on builds with `privacy.resistFingerprinting=true`.
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Simple pref-only clearing of optional passed-in constraints argument.
* **String changes made/needed**: None

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: Are there ESR builds built with `privacy.resistFingerprinting=true`? If so, then this might be of importance to those builds.
* **User impact if declined**: Same
* **Fix Landed on Version**:
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: Same
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:

[Bug 1565374](/show_bug.cgi?id=1565374 "RESOLVED FIXED - Fingerprinting resistance against getUserMedia constraints doesn't work") - Improve test. r?jib

Fixes a potential privacy leak via the getUserMedia API. Approved for 69.0b8 and 68.1esr (I'm sure our Tor friends will appreciate it since they set the privacy.resistFingerprinting pref).

Actually, this is going to need a rebased patch for uplift.
