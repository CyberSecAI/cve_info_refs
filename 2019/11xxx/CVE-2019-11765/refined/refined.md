Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11765:

**CVE Description:**
A compromised content process could send a message to the parent process that would cause the 'Click to Play' permission prompt to be shown. However, due to lack of validation from the parent process, if the user accepted the permission request an attacker-controlled permission would be granted rather than the 'Click to Play' permission.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `browser-plugins.js` file not properly validating the permission data it received from a content process. Specifically, it used the permission string provided by the content process to grant permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The parent process (browser process) did not validate the `permissionString` it received from the content process.
- **Incorrect Permission Granting:** The code used the attacker-controlled permission string directly in `Services.perms.addFromPrincipal` to grant permissions instead of the intended 'Click to Play' permission.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Permission Granting:** A compromised content process could trick the user into granting arbitrary permissions to a website.
- **Sandbox Escape:** Although the permission model was not that powerful, this could lead to some level of sandbox escape by granting elevated rights via a compromised content process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Content Process:** The attacker needs to compromise a content process within Firefox.
- **Message Passing:** The compromised content process sends a specially crafted message to the parent process, containing attacker-controlled permissions.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to accept the 'Click to Play' permission prompt shown as a result of the malicious message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Compromise:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code within a Firefox content process.
- **Message Crafting:** The attacker must craft a specific message to trigger the vulnerable code path in the parent process.
- **User Interaction:** User interaction is needed since the user must click to enable the plugin, as well as accept the permission prompt.

**Additional Notes:**
- The bug was identified with the help of a query developed by the Semmle team.
- The fix was implemented in bug 1505913, which involves making plugin click-to-play fission-aware
- The vulnerability was considered a "sec-moderate" issue due to the mitigation requiring user interaction and the limited power of permissions, but was still deemed necessary to fix.
- The fix involves the parent process getting the permission string from `gPluginHost.getPermissionStringForTag(pluginTag)` rather than from the child process, where `pluginTag` ultimately comes from an ID provided by the content process.
- A limited set of data is sent from the child to the parent, thus preventing the child from having full control over the process.
