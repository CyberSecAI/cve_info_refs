Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a heap buffer overflow in the `parser_get_next_char` function within the `icalparser.c` file of the libical library, which is used by Mozilla Thunderbird to process iCalendar data. The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted iCalendar file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Heap buffer overflow: Specifically, a read out-of-bounds in the `parser_get_next_char` function, where it attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** The heap buffer overflow can lead to a crash, and in some cases, can be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Email Messages with crafted .ics attachments:** The vulnerability is triggered when Thunderbird processes a specially crafted iCalendar (.ics) file, typically delivered via email.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to send emails:**  The attacker needs to be able to send an email to a Thunderbird user, including a malicious iCalendar file.
- **No user interaction required** beyond opening the email (and likely automatically processing the calendar data).

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was discovered through fuzzing of the libical parser.
- The vulnerable code was present in Thunderbird's fork of libical, and a patch from upstream libical was applied to fix the vulnerability.
- The fix involved a change in how `parser_get_next_char` handles quoted strings and delimiters.
- There were some complications with initial patches causing test failures, requiring a secondary fix for `parser_get_next_char` and `parser_get_next_value`.
- The vulnerability was classified as high severity and deemed exploitable.
- The initial reporter of this and related bugs was later awarded a bounty.
