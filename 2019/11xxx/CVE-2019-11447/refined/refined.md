Root cause of vulnerability:
The vulnerability lies in the insufficient control of the `$imgsize` function within the `/core/modules/dashboard.php` file during avatar uploads.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Unrestricted file upload: The application allows users to upload files (avatars) without properly validating their content.
- Header manipulation: Attackers can change the header content of the uploaded file, bypassing the intended controls. By using a "GIF" header, they can trick the application into processing malicious PHP code.
- Insecure image size check: The `$imgsize` function, which is supposed to validate image sizes, is ineffective and can be easily bypassed by modifying the file header.

Impact of exploitation:
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading a file containing malicious PHP code, an attacker can gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

Attack vectors:
- Avatar upload feature: The attacker exploits the avatar upload process in the user profile section to upload a malicious file disguised as an image.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Authenticated user: The attacker needs to be a valid user of the application to access the avatar upload functionality. No admin privileges are required.
