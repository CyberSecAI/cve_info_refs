Based on the provided content, here's information regarding CVE-2019-11405:

*   **Vulnerability:** The `openapi-generator` project generates starter projects that resolve dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. The samples associated with the project are also vulnerable.
*   **Root Cause:** The `build.gradle.mustache` files contain HTTP URLs for dependency resolution.
*   **Weakness:** CWE-829: Inclusion of Functionality from Untrusted Control Sphere, CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
*   **Attack Vector:** A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack can compromise JAR files inflight, potentially infecting build artifacts and developer systems.
*   **Impact:** Maliciously compromised dependencies can infect build artifacts, potentially leading to compromised developer systems and applications.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MITM attack during the dependency resolution process.
*   **Affected code locations:**
    *   `openapi-generator/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/Groovy/build.gradle.mustache`
    *   `openapi-generator/modules/openapi-generator/src/main/resources/kotlin-server/libraries/ktor/build.gradle.mustache`
*   **Mitigation:** The identified instances of HTTP URLs for dependency resolution were changed to HTTPS.
