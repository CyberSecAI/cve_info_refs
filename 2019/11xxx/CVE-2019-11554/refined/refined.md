{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Adobe Mobile SDK had SSL/TLS disabled by default in its configuration file (ADBMobileConfig.json), leading to insecure HTTP connections instead of HTTPS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Communication",
      "Insecure Defaults"
    ],
    "impact": "User data transmitted from mobile applications using the Adobe SDK to Adobe's cloud services was sent over insecure HTTP connections, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and modification via Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks",
      "Network eavesdropping by adversaries on the same network or by ISPs and WiFi access point providers"
     ],
     "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be positioned in a network path between the user's mobile app and Adobe's cloud services. This could be achieved by being on the same local network, controlling a WiFi access point, or being an ISP."
  },
  "affected_components": [
    "Adobe Mobile SDK",
    "Mobile apps using the Adobe Mobile SDK with default settings (e.g., Audible mobile app before version 2.35)"
   ]
