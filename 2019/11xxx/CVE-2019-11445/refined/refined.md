```
- Root cause of vulnerability:
  - The vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of the "Filesystem path" control in the admin's "Export" functionality. This allows an authenticated attacker to specify a malicious path, leading to arbitrary file write.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
  - Unrestricted file upload: The application allows the upload of a malicious JSP file into the "/okm:root" directory.
  - Path traversal: The "Filesystem path" control in the "Export" function can be manipulated to move the uploaded file to an arbitrary location on the server's filesystem.
  - Lack of input validation: The application does not properly validate the provided path, allowing for the malicious file movement.
- Impact of exploitation:
  - Remote code execution: By uploading and moving a malicious JSP file to the web application's directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the application server.
- Attack vectors:
  - The attack vector involves the manipulation of the "Filesystem path" parameter in the "Export" function of the application.
  - The attacker first authenticates to the application, then creates a directory for the payload. A JSP payload is uploaded to the created directory. The attacker then leverages the export functionality to move the uploaded file to the web application's root directory. By requesting the uploaded JSP file, the attacker will execute the code within.
- Required attacker capabilities/position:
  - Authenticated user: The attacker needs to have valid credentials for an administrative user account on the OpenKM system.
  - Network access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the OpenKM server.
