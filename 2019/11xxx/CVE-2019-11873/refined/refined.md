Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-11873:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a buffer overflow located in the `TLSX_PreSharedKey_Use` function during the parsing of the TLSv1.3 Pre-Shared Key (PSK) extension within the wolfSSL library. Specifically, the code copies the client's provided identity data to a buffer named `client_identity` without checking the size of the input identity against the buffer's fixed size of 128 bytes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Buffer Overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the `XMEMCPY` function when handling the identity data from a client's PSK extension.
- **Missing Input Validation:** The `current->identityLen` is not properly validated against the size of `ssl->arrays->client_identity`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution:** An attacker can potentially overwrite a large portion of the server's RAM, potentially leading to remote code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** Overwriting memory can crash the server leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based:** The attacker sends a specially crafted Client Hello packet over the network to a vulnerable wolfSSL server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable server.
- **Crafted Client Hello Packet:** The attacker must craft a TLS Client Hello packet that includes a malicious PSK extension with a large identity payload. The attacker has to control these fields: record length, client hello length, total extensions length, PSK extension length, total identities length and identity length, setting them to their maximum value (65535), along with the attack data itself with a size of about 65 kilobytes.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability affects wolfSSL versions 3.12.0-stable to 4.0.0-stable.
- The vulnerability was discovered using modern fuzzing methods.
- The provided text includes code snippets from `internal.h`, `tls.c` and `tls13.c` of the wolfSSL library, with comments indicating where the vulnerability occurs.
- The vulnerability is located in the `DoPreSharedKeys` and `TLSX_PreSharedKey_Use` functions
- The identity data is copied using the function `XMEMCPY` into a fixed size buffer `client_identity`, which leads to the overflow when the identity data is greater than the buffer size (128 bytes).
