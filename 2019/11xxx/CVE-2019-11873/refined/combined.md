Variant of Satori/Mirai detected attacking public available ADB shells

10 July 2018

On the 10th of July at 23:30 UTC we noticed an increased traffic on our blackhole monitoring on TCP port 5555. Upon further analyzation, we saw a big chunk of this traffic coming from China, USA and the Dominican Republic. In total we gathered 246.434 packets from 68.361 unique IPs. Based on the packet details we gathered, we can assume that the packets were generated by a lot of different devices. In addition, the traffic behavior on port 555 matches the typicall scan behavior of botnets.

5 Jan 2018

By misuse of several processor bugs it is possible to break up the separation between the kernel and user space.

## Deutsche Telekom CERT Assessment

On Intel CPU driven platforms, it is possible for normal user programs to gather information about protected kernel memory areas (“Meltdown attack”, CVE-2017-5754) [1] [2].  This results in an information leakage between kernel and user space.

This vulnerability affects every Intel CPU produced in the past decade (CPUs since 1995 except Itanium and pre-2013 Atoms). The in [3] listed ARM cores are also affected by this vulnerability.

A further issue is described in the “Spectre attack” (CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715). Spectre allows a user-mode application to extract information from other processes or VMs to access memory of other VMs. This vulnerability affects all listed Intel CPUs, as well as AMD’s Ryzen, FX and Pro families and several ARM Cortex cores listed in [3].

Official disclosure for Spectre and Meltdown took place on 2018-01-04 [10].

To exploit both vulnerabilities an attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target machine.

Thus, up to now network components like routers, switches, firewalls, mobiles or CPEs don’t provide enough attack surface for exploitation even if they are affected. On most network components it is very difficult to run attacker crafted code because they’ve never been designed to run custom code.

## Recommendations

* Apply patches as soon as they are available from the respective supplier
  (for Microsoft desktop systems check availability with AV vendors [13])
* Top priority should be patching of (see timeline below)
  o   hypervisors of cloud systems
  o   operating systems of desktop clients and virtual/remote desktop systems
  o   operating systems of hosting platforms
* On XEN hypervisors:
  o   Enable “supervisor mode execute protection” if possible
  o   Evaluate if XEN VMs can be run in HVM or PVM mode (only PV hosting hypervisors are affected)
* For network components
  o   Even if an attack is unlikely ask your vendor if your device is vulnerable and needs patching

**Patch Prioritization**

In general high priority patching is advised for every machine which runs untrusted code from third parties. On shared and exclusive private clouds there is less risk because these platforms are dedicated to trusted customers. On all other servers it is unlikely that an attacker is able to run arbitrary code. Patch your system based on local patch cycles.

Due to the complexity of the attack it is unlikely that smartphones get exploited.

**Patch Availability**

* Microsoft Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, 10 [5]
  o   McAfee is now patch compatible [12]
  o   Further AV vendors can be found in [13]
  o   A registry key has to be set. Without the key the client doesn’t fetch the update. See [5].
* Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2, Server 2012 R2, Server 2016, Server Version 1709 Attention: The mitigation has to be enabled via registry [6]
* Mac OS X 10.13.1 (10.13.2 isn’t vulnerable)
* Several Suse Linux and RHEL distributions [7] [8]
* VMware ESXi 5.5 to 6.5, Workstation 12.X and 14.X, Fusion 8.X [9]
* Android (patchlevel 2018-01-05)
* iOS (patchlevel 11.2)

Linux Kernel patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-09.

IBM AIX patches will be most probably available on 2018-01-12 [11].

There is no announcement for a SOLARIS patch, we are in touch with Oracle.

New critical remote buffer overflow vulnerability
in wolfSSL TLSv1.3 PSK extension parsing
(CVE-2019-11873)
by Robert Hörr (e-mail: robert.hoerr@t-systems.com)
(Security Evaluator of the Telekom Security Evaluation Facility)

A new critical remote buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2019-11873) was discovered
in  the  wolfSSL  library  (versions  3.12.0-stable  -  4.0.0-stable,  http://www.wolfssl.com)
by  Security  Evaluators  of  Telekom  Security  with  modern  fuzzing  methods.  The
vulnerability  allows  an  attacker  to  overwrite  a  large  part  of  the  RAM  of  a  wolfSSL
server with his data over the network. This might allow remote code execution. The

What is the wolfSSL library?
The  wolfSSL  library  is  an  open  source  project  providing  implementations  of  the
security network protocols SSL, TLS and DTLS for embedded devices. The wolfSSL
library  is  employed  in  many  commercially  used  systems,  for  example,  MySQL  and
cURL.  The  security  protocols  ensure  that  two  endpoints  can  communicate  in  a
secure way over a network like the internet, so that an attacker is not able to read or
modify the exchanged data.

What is the TLS PSK extension?
The TLS PSK  extension allows  a  secure  communication  with  previously  exchanged
shared  keys.  Hence,  both  endpoints  have  the  same  keys  and  the  key  agreement
process of the TLS handshake to negotiate a shared key is not necessary anymore.
The  advantages  of  the  extension  is  that  a  PKI  is  not  needed  and  public  key
operations can be avoided.

How was the vulnerability discovered?
Computer software is becoming more complex. So, it is almost impossible to perform
a  complete  source  code  review  with  reasonable  coverage.  For  this  reason,  modern
fuzzing  methods  are  used  to  discover  vulnerabilities.  The  fuzzing  methods  include,
among other things, AFL, libFuzzer and AdressSanitizer. The tools AFL and libFuzzer
are code coverage based fuzzer which are the next generation of fuzzing tools. The
wolfSSL library was fuzzed using these fuzzing methods. The AddressSanitizer found
the reported buffer overflow(stack overflow) in this article.

Where is the vulnerability located in the source code?
The  vulnerability  is  located  in  the  TLSv1.3  server  parsing  process  of  the  PSK
extension  of  the  client  hello  packet.  For  a  better  understanding,  the  vulnerability  is
explained  based  on  the  source  code  sections  in  the  appendix  of  this  article.  The
source  code  lines  marked  in  bold  are  important  for  understanding.  Next,  the
vulnerability is described step by step. For each enumerated step, the corresponding
source code line in the appendix is marked with the step number as a comment (e.g.
//step1).

1.  The size of the PSK extension is written to the variable size. Then the variable
size  is  checked  if  it  is  greater  than  the  total  size  of  all  extensions.  So  the
variable size cannot be greater than the total size of all extensions.

2.  The  total  size  of  all  identities  is  written  to  the  variable  len. Then  the  variable
len  is  checked  if  it  is  greater  than  the  size  of  the  PSK  extension.  So  the
variable len cannot be greater than the size of the PSK extension.

3.  The size of one identity is written to the variable identityLen. Then the variable
identityLen  is  checked  if  it  is  greater  than  the  variable  len.  So  the  variable
identityLen cannot be greater than the variable len.

4.  The  new  identity  (data:  identity,  size:  identityLen)  is  written  to  the  variable

ssl→extensions. The value of the variable identityLen is not checked.

5.  The  data  of  the  new  identity  (array:  current→identity)  is  copied  to  the  array
ssl→arrays→client_identity  with  the  size  current→identityLen. But  the  size  of
the  array  identity  can  be  greater  than  the  size  of  the  array  client_identity.
Hence, the first 128 bytes are written into the array client_identity and the rest
is written into undefined memory. The size of the rest can be about 65 kilobyte,
if the length fields of client hello packet: record length, client hello length, total
extensions  length,  PSK  extension  length,  total  identities  length  and  identity
length contain their maximum value, which is 65535 (see steps 1-4).

How is the vulnerability exploitable by an attacker?
An attacker sends a special crafted hello client packet over the network to a TLSv1.3
wolfSSL server. The length fields of the packet: record length, client hello length, total
extensions  length,  PSK  extension  length,  total  identity  length  and  identity  length
contain  their  maximum  value,  which  is  65535.  The  identity  data  field  of  the  PSK
extension of the packet contains the attack data, which the attacker wants to store in
the undefined memory (RAM) of the server. The size of the data is about 65 kilobyte.
Possibly the attacker can then perform a remote code execution attack.

What do we learn from this?
Code  coverage  based  fuzzing  combined  with  the  AddressSanitizer  is  a  powerful
method to discover e.g. buffer overflows. With increasingly complex source codes, it
is  a  resource-efficient  alternative  to  source  code  reviews,  because  this  fuzzing
approach  can  be  done  mainly  automatically.  As  there  exist  many  approaches  for
fuzzing, it is the art of fuzzing to find the best approach. We have already discovered
several vulnerabilities with our fuzzing approach.
