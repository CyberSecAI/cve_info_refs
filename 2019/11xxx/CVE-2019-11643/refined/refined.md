- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within textboxes designated as "string" type, leading to the ability to inject malicious JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to inject malicious JavaScript, which is then stored in the data store. This can lead to various malicious actions when the stored data is rendered to other users.
- **Attack vectors**: Textboxes within the OneShield Policy (Dragon) framework that are of type "string" are vulnerable to injection. Both authenticated and unauthenticated users can perform the attack.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript remotely without needing prior access or elevated privileges.
