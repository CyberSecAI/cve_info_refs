  "CVE-2019-11598": {
    "description": "In ImageMagick 7.0.8-40 Q16, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the function WritePNMImage of coders/pnm.c, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly information disclosure via a crafted image file. This is related to SetGrayscaleImage in MagickCore/quantize.c.",
