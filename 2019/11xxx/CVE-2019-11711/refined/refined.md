Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11711:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox handles inner window reuse, specifically when `document.domain` is involved. The browser does not properly consider `document.domain` when determining if an inner window can be reused.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Inadequate Origin Check:** When a new tab or iframe is created, the browser can reuse an existing inner window (the underlying object representing the browser context) from a previous load. The check for reuse did not consider the document.domain. If a page from one subdomain on a domain (e.g., `a.example.com`) sets `document.domain` to `example.com`, it can then reuse an inner window from a page on a different subdomain of the same domain (e.g., `b.example.com`), even if the second subdomain doesn't have set `document.domain` to the same value.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This reuse allows the second page to execute script in the context of the first page (from another subdomain), bypassing same-origin policies.
*   **Bypassing same-origin policy:** The  `document.domain` is not considered correctly during inner window reuse which can bypass restrictions enforced by same-origin policy.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a page from a different subdomain of the same domain.
*  **Data Exfiltration and Manipulation:** Once arbitrary script is injected the attacker is able to exfiltrate data by sending it to servers or inject script that modifies the DOM of the page being attacked.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Inner Window Reuse:** An attacker must create a page that sets `document.domain` and then initiates the loading of another page in a new tab or iframe, and then attempt to access the newly loaded page through a method that triggers the inner window reuse and gain access to the new pages context, even though its domain may be different.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to host a webpage on a subdomain and create another webpage on another subdomain, within a domain where `document.domain` is used. The attacker does not need the ability to modify the code of the targeted domain.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into opening the attacker controlled page in a new tab, or iframe.

**Additional Details:**

* This vulnerability existed because of a change in Firefox's code (specifically [bug 956382](/show_bug.cgi?id=956382)) where it stopped taking the document domain into account for inner window reuse.
* Chrome and Safari are mentioned to have more strict inner window reuse rules.

*The bug was fixed by ensuring that `document.domain` is considered during inner window reuse decisions.*
