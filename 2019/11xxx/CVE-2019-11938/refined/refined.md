Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11938:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper size checks in the Java implementation of Facebook Thrift when deserializing messages. Specifically, when reading containers (like lists, sets, and maps), the server would allocate memory based on the size declared in the message without verifying if the declared size matches the remaining payload size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Memory Over-allocation:** The primary weakness is the possibility of over-allocating memory. A malicious client could send a short message that declares a very large container size. The server would then attempt to allocate memory based on this declared size, even if the actual remaining data in the payload is much smaller, leading to a potential out-of-memory condition or excessive memory usage.
*   **Lack of Size Verification:** The vulnerability is directly caused by the absence of checks to ensure the declared size of the container matches the available data in the current frame before performing deserialization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The most significant impact is the potential for denial-of-service attacks. By exploiting the memory over-allocation vulnerability, an attacker can force the server to exhaust its memory resources, making it unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Maliciously Crafted Messages:** The attack vector involves sending carefully crafted Thrift messages with misleading container size declarations.
*   **Network Communication:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with a vulnerable Thrift server to deliver the malicious messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to a vulnerable Thrift server.
*   **Thrift Protocol Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of the Thrift protocol to create messages with manipulated container size declarations.
*   **Client Functionality:** The attacker can act as a client that communicates with the Thrift server.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Facebook Thrift prior to version v2019.12.09.00 is vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** The fix involves adding checks to verify the remaining frame size before deserializing strings or collections. The fixes are implemented in the commits [08c2d41](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/commit/08c2d412adb214c40bb03be7587057b25d053030) and [71c97ff](https://github.com/facebook/fbthrift/commit/71c97ffdcb61cccf1f8267774e873e21ebd3ebd3).
*   The fix ensures there is enough data in the current frame before deserializing, preventing over-allocation.
