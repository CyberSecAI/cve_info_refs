Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11764:

**Verification:**

1.  The advisory from mozilla.org clearly lists **CVE-2019-11764** as a memory safety bug, stating "Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2" with a list of bugs.
2.  The included bugzilla content confirms that the listed bug IDs (1558522, 1577061, etc.) were indeed the source of memory safety bugs.
3.  The Ubuntu Security Notice (USN-4335-1) also includes CVE-2019-11764, stating that it is related to memory safety issues, amongst other vulnerabilities, and affects Thunderbird.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of CVE-2019-11764 is a collection of memory safety bugs. The individual bugs leading to these vulnerabilities include heap-use-after-free, stack overflows, dangling pointers, and out-of-bounds access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Heap-use-after-free:** Occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed, leading to corruption. Example: Bug 1571223, Bug 1575217, Bug 1583463, Bug 1558522
*   **Stack buffer overflow:** Occurs when a buffer on the stack is written past its boundaries. Example: Bug 1577061
*   **Dangling pointer:** Occurs when a pointer points to memory that is no longer valid. Example: Bug 1581950
*   **Out-of-bounds access:** Memory is read/written outside the intended area. Example: Bug 1586845
*   **Incorrect state/logic**  Example: Bug 1548044, Bug 1583684, Bug 1578933, Bug 1586599, Bug 1573048

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, gaining full control of the system
*  **Denial of Service:** Cause crashes or other interruptions by corrupting memory
*   **Memory corruption**: Corrupting program state or program data.
*   **Information Disclosure**: leaking data from the affected process

**Attack vectors:**

*   These vulnerabilities are mostly triggered by processing crafted or malicious content (web pages, network packets, etc.). The exact mechanism varies depending on the specific bug, as some could be triggered by a specific network configuration, a malformed HTML entity or other malformed content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Attackers must be able to deliver crafted input that triggers the specific vulnerability. This could be done through a malicious web page, a crafted network packet, a malformed email or other method of delivering content to the vulnerable application.
*  No special position is needed, if the vector is a remote one. Local attacks might need some specific user actions.

**Additional notes:**

*   The advisory and bugzilla entries point out that these are memory safety bugs that could lead to arbitrary code execution, indicating a high severity.
*   The bug list associated with this CVE indicates that multiple different components within Firefox and Thunderbird were affected.
*   The ubuntu security notice indicates a wide impact across several CVEs with a variety of consequences
*   The advisory makes clear that community members and mozilla developers discovered the bugs
