The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11838.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in `Array.prototype.splice()` that occurs after a resize operation. The issue stems from memory corruption during array resizing in the njs JavaScript engine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow in `njs_array_prototype_splice` function.
- Memory corruption during array resizing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution could be possible.
- Program crashes due to memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- By exploiting the `splice()` method of an array.
- The issue is triggered through a crafted JavaScript program that repeatedly resizes arrays and calls `splice()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code through the vulnerable njs engine.
- No special position is needed, other than ability to execute JavaScript in context of njs.
