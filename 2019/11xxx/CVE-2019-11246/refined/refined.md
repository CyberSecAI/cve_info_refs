Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11246:

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-11246 is a vulnerability in the `kubectl cp` command of Kubernetes that allows a malicious container to potentially overwrite files on the user's machine when using `kubectl cp` to copy files from the container. This is due to insufficient sanitization of paths extracted from a tar archive.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the way `kubectl cp` handles tar archives when copying files from a container. Specifically, if the tar binary within the container is compromised, it could generate a malicious tar archive containing crafted filenames with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) or symlinks pointing outside the intended destination directory. The `kubectl cp` command did not properly sanitize the extracted paths or follow symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization of paths extracted from the tar archive. This allows a malicious tar to include relative path components (`..`) that could traverse the directory structure on the user's machine, potentially writing to arbitrary locations.
*   **Symlink Following:** The `kubectl cp` command would follow symlinks provided in the tar archive, without verifying the target of the symlink is within the intended destination.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the user's local machine that the user has permissions to write to. This can lead to data loss or corruption, and could potentially be used to execute malicious code.
*   **Code Execution:** If an attacker can overwrite critical files like shell configuration files, they could achieve code execution on the user's machine when the user initiates a new shell.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Compromised Container:** The primary attack vector is a compromised container. If an attacker can gain control of a container within the Kubernetes cluster and replace the `tar` binary, they can create a malicious archive during a `kubectl cp` operation.
*   **User Action Required:** The user must initiate the `kubectl cp` command to copy files from the compromised container to the local machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Container Compromise:** The attacker must have the ability to compromise a container running in a Kubernetes cluster. This includes the ability to execute commands within the container.
*   **`kubectl cp` Usage:** The attacker requires a user with `kubectl` access and permission to copy files from the compromised container using `kubectl cp`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `kubectl cp` command uses the `tar` command inside the container to create an archive of files and then extracts this archive on the user's machine.
*   The `cp.go:clean` function is used to strip path traversals, but it can still follow symbolic links, potentially escaping the target directory.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a tar archive with symlinks or path traversal sequences, like "../../../../../file".
*   The fix involves additional validation and sanitization of the paths during the untar operation, including stricter checks to ensure that destination paths and symlink targets stay within the target directory.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Kubernetes versions 1.11.9, 1.12.7, 1.13.5, and 1.14.0
*   The vulnerability is related to, but distinct from CVE-2018-1002100, which was fixed previously, and the fix for CVE-2018-1002100 did not fully address path traversal via symbolic links.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Ariel Zelivansky of Twistlock.
*   NetApp lists CVE-2019-11246 as a medium severity vulnerability
*   The github advisory for CVE-2019-11246 lists the affected Kubernetes versions as "versions prior to 1.12.9, versions prior to 1.13.6, versions prior to 1.14.2, and versions 1.1, 1.2, 1.4, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11.".
