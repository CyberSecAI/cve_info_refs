Comments can have arbitrary tags added to them to help with filtering as well as mark comments as spam or abusive.Component
Components are second-level categories; each belongs to a particular Product. Select a Product to narrow down this list.Creation date
When the bug was filed.Depends on
The bugs listed here must be resolved before this bug can be resolved.Duplicates
List of bugs that have been marked a duplicate of the bug currently being viewed.Keywords
Keywords are a controlled vocabulary for characterizing bugs across Products and Components. Examples of this field are `regression`, `sec-high`, and `topcrash`. Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product

Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

The large thread number here in combination with a stack issue being reported makes me think of Windows-only problems we previously had with memory being reused from previous threads without the respective shadow memory being purged/updated. As far as I know, this has been fixed but maybe not entirely?

Maybe :dmajor has an idea?

This is a legitimate buffer size bug: [sizeof(DWORD) here](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/media/webrtc/trunk/webrtc/rtc_base/platform_thread.cc#85) needs to be sizeof(ULONG\_PTR) instead, according to [MSDN's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/debugger/how-to-set-a-thread-name-in-native-code?view=vs-2015&redirectedfrom=MSDN). It would also be good to have the `#pragma pack push/pop` as well.

I looked at disassembly and confirmed that webrtc's call is passing 6 for the buffer size, while [NSS's implementation](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/9df2ccc256fe54c314b34e52920471a0d04b283e/nsprpub/pr/src/md/windows/w95thred.c#260), which follows the documentation, passes a size of only 3.

Nils, can your team take this to upstream? Note that due to some refactoring this code now lives at [platform\_thread\_types.cc](https://webrtc.googlesource.com/src/%2B/b028c6a8ff1f1b32802f7a08b2fd370cfd066fca/rtc_base/platform_thread_types.cc#69).

(Finally, it's worth mentioning that there is now a better API for this: [SetThreadDescription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadsapi-setthreaddescription?redirectedfrom=MSDN), but it's only available in Windows 10, so most authors still keep the RaiseException code as a fallback)

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: I am not sure. There are a number of ways that a new thread could be spawned via JS interaction, starting a desktop capture, starting a call etc. These uses have different thread names that are all, as far as I can tell, string literals. There is very little control over the inputs to that function. Investigating this by looking at the code is made difficult by: 1) the number of places this can be triggered in the library, when we probably only exercise a small subset of them, and 2) the number of layers of indirection and proxy classes within the library.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: Unknown
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: all (this landed in FFx 53)
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: No
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: They should be trivial to create and apply, and they are low risk.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Probably fairly low, as it is code that exists elsewhere in the tree. I have only tested this on my personal Windows 10-64bit machine, and have not pushed to try to test other Windows build targets.

We and Google should use the same CVE for this fix. Nominally Google should be the CNA for this project, but sometimes they're happy to let us assign one rather than try to get through their process in time for our release. Check with them.

## Security Vulnerabilities fixed in Thunderbird 68.5

Announced
February 11, 2020
Impact
moderate
Products
Thunderbird
Fixed in

* Thunderbird 68.5

#### [#CVE-2020-6793: Out-of-bounds read when processing certain email messages](#CVE-2020-6793)

Reporter
Chiaki ISHIKAWA
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When processing an email message with an ill-formed envelope, Thunderbird could read data from a random memory location.

##### References

* [Bug 1608539](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1608539)

#### [#CVE-2020-6794: Setting a master password post-Thunderbird 52 does not delete unencrypted previously stored passwords](#CVE-2020-6794)

Reporter
Jurgen Gaeremyn
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and then later set a master password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords is still accessible. This is because the older stored password file was not deleted when the data was copied to a new format starting in Thunderbird 60. The new master password is added only on the new file. This could allow the exposure of stored password data outside of user expectations.

* [Bug 1606619](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1606619)

#### [#CVE-2020-6795: Crash processing S/MIME messages with multiple signatures](#CVE-2020-6795)

Reporter
Stephan Lauffer
Impact
moderate
##### Description

When processing a message that contains multiple S/MIME signatures, a bug in the MIME processing code caused a null pointer dereference, leading to an unexploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-6797: Extensions granted downloads.open permission could open arbitrary applications on Mac OSX](#CVE-2020-6797)

Reporter
Vladimir Metnew
Impact
moderate
##### Description

By downloading a file with the .fileloc extension, a semi-privileged extension could launch an arbitrary application on the user's computer. The attacker is restricted as they are unable to download non-quarantined files or supply command line arguments to the application, limiting the impact.
*Note: this issue only occurs on Mac OSX. Other operating systems are unaffected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1596668](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1596668)

#### [#CVE-2020-6798: Incorrect parsing of template tag could result in JavaScript injection](#CVE-2020-6798)

Reporter
terjanq
Impact
moderate
##### Description

If a `<template>` tag was used in a `<select%gt;` tag, the parser could be confused and allow JavaScript parsing and execution when it should not be allowed. A site that relied on the browser behaving correctly could suffer a cross-site scripting vulnerability as a result.
*In general, this flaw cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but is potentially a risk in browser or browser-like contexts.*

##### References

* [Bug 1602944](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1602944)

#### [#CVE-2020-6792: Message ID calculcation was based on uninitialized data](#CVE-2020-6792)

Reporter
Chiaki ISHIKAWA
Impact
low
##### Description

When deriving an identifier for an email message, uninitialized memory was used in addition to the message contents.

##### References

* [Bug 1609607](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1609607)

#### [#CVE-2020-6800: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.5](#CVE-2020-6800)

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers and community members Raul Gurzau, Tyson Smith, Bob Clary, Liz Henry, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 72 and Firefox ESR 68.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

| [Description](/show_bug.cgi?id=1586176#c0)• 5 years ago |
|  | |

In `NSC_EncryptUpdate`, suppose that the `*pulEncryptedPartLen` parameter is smaller than the block size.

We assume the following path through the function:

```
...
if (crv != CKR_OK)  // false
...
if (!pEncryptedPart) {  // false
...
if (context->doPad) {  // true
    /* deal with previous buffered data */
    if (context->padDataLength != 0) {  // true
        /* fill in the padded to a full block size */
        for (...) {
            // this loop continues until context->padDataLength == context->blockSize
            // for this to happen, it's sufficient that ulPartLen >= context->blockSize
            //   i.e., that there are at least context->blockSize bytes of input
            // or more precisely, this will happen when
            //   ulPartLen + context->padDataLength >= context->blockSize
        }
        /* not enough data to encrypt yet? then return */
        if (context->padDataLength != context->blockSize) {  // false, due to above
          ...
        }
        /* encrypt the current padded data */
        rv = (*context->update)(context->cipherInfo, pEncryptedPart,
                                &padoutlen, context->blockSize, context->padBuf,
                                context->blockSize);

```

In the call to `context->update`, the fourth parameter indicates the maximum length which can be written to the output buffer `pEncryptedPart`. This parameter is set to be `context->blockSize`, even though only `*pulEncryptedPartLen` bytes remain in the output buffer, and we were assuming that `*pulEncryptedPartLen` was less than the block size.

There are two ramifications of this: first, we can have a small out-of-bounds write here. The call to `context->update` can write up to about `context->blockSize` bytes off of the end of the output buffer.

Second, `context->update` will write to the variable `padoutlen` indicating the number of bytes written. Supposing `context->update` does write the allowed maximum of `context->blockSize` bytes to the buffer, we will have `padoutlen == context->blockSize`. Then:

```
pEncryptedPart += padoutlen;  // advancing the pEncryptedPart pointer beyond the end of the buffer
maxout -= padoutlen;

```

Since `maxout` was initialized to be `*pulEncryptedPartLen` and is thus smaller than the block size in this case, the subtraction will wrap around and give a very large positive value for `maxout` due to its unsigned type.

The subsequent use of `maxout` here:

```
/* do it: NOTE: this assumes buf size in is >= buf size out! */
rv = (*context->update)(context->cipherInfo, pEncryptedPart,
                        &outlen, maxout, pPart, ulPartLen);

```

will allow `context->update` to write up to `maxout` many bytes, that is, effectively arbitrarily many bytes to `pEncryptedPart`. This is an out-of-bounds write arbitrarily far beyond the buffer.

I think the first call to `context->update` should pass `maxout` rather than `context->blockSize` as the fourth parameter, so that the maximum output length is `maxout` rather than `context->blockSize`. I.e.,

```
        rv = (*context->update)(context->cipherInfo, pEncryptedPart,
-                               &padoutlen, context->blockSize, context->padBuf,
+                               &padoutlen, maxout, context->padBuf,
                                context->blockSize);

```

The related function `NSC_DecryptUpdate` already does this: it uses `maxout` for the maximum-output-length parameter to `context->update` every time it calls `context->update`.

I wanted to write a test for this last night, but couldn't find tests that consume the APIs directly. If ya'll point me to a sane example I'm happy to take a stab at adding a test.

I didn't get as far into this today as I was hoping. However, the sanest example I see is [pk11\_cbc\_unittest.cc](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/gtests/pk11_gtest/pk11_cbc_unittest.cc#101), which uses CKM\_AES\_CBC\_PAD to call `NSC_EncryptUpdate` via `PK11_Encrypt`.

The trick seems to be getting `if (context->padDataLength != 0)` to be true, because on the first invocation, the context (and `padDataLength`) is fresh. From an initial pass, this doesn't seem to be possible in `PK11_Encrypt`, but there are other paths that will need to be checked. [PK11\_CipherOp](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/pk11wrap/pk11cxt.c#698) looks to be more flexible.

I'll continue looking into this next week. Thanks!

Thanks. I confirmed both outcomes from the report.

To exploit we need two things then: 1) multi-part encryption, and 2) the property that a call can be made with `*pulEncryptedPartLen` (`maxout`) of less than one block, via attacker-control or a programming error. Webcrypto is not affected as neither condition holds. This leaves the following notable paths (among others that are more trivially unexploitable).

1. [ssl3\_MACEncryptRecord](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/security/nss/lib/ssl/ssl3con.c#2186): If `p1Len` is less than 256, it is moved to `oddLen` and encrypted with `p2` (where `maxout` will be at least "MAC bytes" long). This should be safe.
2. [SRTP](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/srtp/src/crypto/cipher/aes_icm_nss.c#308) calls this function for both encrypt and decrypt, but uses in-place operations (where outLen == inLen), so the arbitrary overwrite is not possible (`*pulEncryptedPartLen < BLOCK_SIZE && *pulEncryptedPartLen == ulPartLen`). This still leaves the potential for an *up-to-blocksize* overrun.

I'm only seeing a Firefox exploit path through #2, but I'd label this sec-high as: 1) #2 suggests this is remotely exploitable since it's called to decrypt, and 2) the bug lies in a general-purpose function with many callers. If one fails to protect (or session is inappropriately reused), we could well be vulnerable to the arbitrary overwrite case.

Let me know if my analysis missed anything.

If y'all are interested, this bug was found with Pitchfork, a symbolic execution tool we're working on to detect constant-time violations. In this case, Pitchfork found inputs that triggered the arbitrary write and then used that power to trivially violate constant-time (e.g. by overwriting some pointer to point to a secret key - I don't remember the precise details at this moment). I believe Deian has already mentioned the tool to some of you.

0001-Bug-1586176-EncryptUpdate-should-use-maxout-not-bloc.patch

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Moderate difficulty. The change highlights the problem, but an attacker has to trigger a moderately-complex set of conditions to exploit. The tests will not be landed until a later date.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: None
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**: Little risk and clean application to all branches.
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Unlikely. It's a single line change and the corresponding Decrypt function already uses `maxout` as in this patch.

I'm requesting uplift to beta; but leaving the sec-approval flag so it stays in-queue.

This has me nervous since it's in networking code (outside the sandbox.) I don't think we should land this in Nightly without also landing it in beta. So if Beta gets approved; we'll land it in both, and if it doesn't, we'll re-evaluate.

Either way we should not land the test until the normal 4-weeks after the release train gets the fix.

Dan what do you think about the riskiness here? The build is tomorrow so I have to decide by Sunday night.

I'm inclined to go for it, since folks seem to agree the patch risk is low even though last minute changes in network code always feel a bit scary.

Keep in mind that if we point release Fx70, we'll need to do the same for 68.2esr. Is there a particularly-urgent reason this can't ship in Fx71/68.3esr in early December?

I filed a bug for ESR, too ([bug 1588558](/show_bug.cgi?id=1588558 "RESOLVED FIXED - Upgrade Firefox ESR 68 to use NSS 3.44.3")), but while this issue is severe, I don't see any reason to consider it critical -- or critical enough for a point release on its own.

Daiki, a heads-up for you on this one. We're deferring it for up to a cycle here and it might have wider impacts for you and your customers than Firefox.

Uplift approval for this patch will run through the various dependent "Update NSS" bugs on file rather than through this bug directly.

0001-Bug-1586176-EncryptUpdate-should-use-maxout-not-bloc.patch
Plan is NSS 3.46.2 for a potential 70 dot release, 3.47.1 for 71 beta, and 3.44.3 for 68 ESR. If we get a dot release, we'd probably want to land this sooner rather than later so we know it's stable for that. But otherwise I'd be inclined to land it later.... But cutting NSS releases is tricky and we don't want to do it before releng is ready to take it. So I think the conclusion is: JC, you can land this when you think is best and it fits the NSS schedule.

#### [#CVE-2020-6805: Use-after-free when removing data about origins](#CVE-2020-6805)

Reporter
Brian Carpenter
Impact
high
##### Description

When removing data about an origin whose tab was recently closed, a use-after-free could occur in the Quota manager, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1610880](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1610880)

#### [#CVE-2020-6806: BodyStream::OnInputStreamReady was missing protections against state confusion](#CVE-2020-6806)

Reporter
Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero
Impact
high
##### Description

By carefully crafting promise resolutions, it was possible to cause an out-of-bounds read off the end of an array resized during script execution. This could have led to memory corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1612308](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1612308)

#### [#CVE-2020-6807: Use-after-free in cubeb during stream destruction](#CVE-2020-6807)

Reporter
C.M.Chang
Impact
high
##### Description

When a device was changed while a stream was about to be destroyed, the `stream-reinit` task may have been executed after the stream was destroyed, causing a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

#### [#CVE-2020-6811: Devtools' 'Copy as cURL' feature did not fully escape website-controlled data, potentially leading to command injection](#CVE-2020-6811)

Reporter
Ophir LOJKINE
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The 'Copy as cURL' feature of Devtools' network tab did not properly escape the HTTP method of a request, which can be controlled by the website. If a user used the 'Copy as Curl' feature and pasted the command into a terminal, it could have resulted in command injection and arbitrary command execution.

* [Bug 1607742](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1607742)

#### [#CVE-2019-20503: Out of bounds reads in sctp\_load\_addresses\_from\_init](#CVE-2019-20503)

Reporter
Natalie Silvanovich of Google Project Zero
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The inputs to `sctp_load_addresses_from_init` are verified by `sctp_arethere_unrecognized_parameters`; however, the two functions handled parameter bounds differently, resulting in out of bounds reads when parameters are partially outside a chunk.

#### [#CVE-2020-6812: The names of AirPods with personally identifiable information were exposed to websites with camera or microphone permission](#CVE-2020-6812)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

The first time AirPods are connected to an iPhone, they become named after the user's name by default (e.g. Jane Doe's AirPods.) Websites with camera or microphone permission are able to enumerate device names, disclosing the user's name. To resolve this issue, Firefox added a special case that renames devices containing the substring 'AirPods' to simply 'AirPods'.

#### [#CVE-2020-6814: Memory safety bugs fixed in Thunderbird 68.6](#CVE-2020-6814)

Reporter
Mozilla developers
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Byron Campen, Jason Kratzer, and Christian Holler reported memory safety bugs present in Thunderbird 68.5. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

# USN-4241-1: Thunderbird vulnerabilities

16 January 2020

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird.

### Reduce your security exposure

Ubuntu Pro provides ten-year security coverage to 25,000+ packages in Main and Universe repositories, and it is free for up to five machines.

[Learn more about Ubuntu Pro](/pro)

## Releases

* [Ubuntu 19.10](/security/notices?release=eoan)
* [Ubuntu 18.04 ESM](/security/notices?release=bionic)

## Packages

* [thunderbird](/security/cves?package=thunderbird) - Mozilla Open Source mail and newsgroup client

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2019-17005](/security/CVE-2019-17005), [CVE-2019-17008](/security/CVE-2019-17008), [CVE-2019-17010](/security/CVE-2019-17010), [CVE-2019-17011](/security/CVE-2019-17011),

[CVE-2019-17012](/security/CVE-2019-17012), [CVE-2019-17016](/security/CVE-2019-17016), [CVE-2019-17017](/security/CVE-2019-17017), [CVE-2019-17022](/security/CVE-2019-17022),

[CVE-2019-17024](/security/CVE-2019-17024), [CVE-2019-17026](/security/CVE-2019-17026))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

## Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package versions:

##### Ubuntu 19.10

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [1:68.4.1+build1-0ubuntu0.19.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/1%3A68.4.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.19.10.1)

##### Ubuntu 18.04

* [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird)
  -
  [1:68.4.1+build1-0ubuntu0.18.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/%2Bsource/thunderbird/1%3A68.4.1%2Bbuild1-0ubuntu0.18.04.1)

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make

all the necessary changes.

Reporter
Mozilla developers and community
Impact
high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Christoph Diehl, Nathan Froyd, Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, Karl Tomlinson, Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

high
##### Description

Mozilla developers Christoph Diehl, Nathan Froyd, Jason Kratzer, Christian Holler, Karl Tomlinson, Tyson Smith reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 70 and Firefox ESR 68.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on Industrial Security by Siemens can be found at: https://www.siemens.com/

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

RUGGEDCOM products provide a level of robustness and reliability that have set the standard for
communications networks deployed in harsh environments. Designed to meet and exceed IEC 61850-3
protocol requirements, the RUGGEDCOM Layer 3 Multi-Service Platform family of switches and routers
offers integrated router, ﬁrewall and VPN functionalities. The RUGGEDCOM RX1400 is a multi-protocol
intelligent node which combines Ethernet switching, routing and application hosting capabilities with
various wide area connectivity options.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2018-12404

A cached side channel attack during handshakes using RSA encryption could allow for the decryption
of encrypted content. This is a variant of the Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher

# Mozilla Firefox: Multiple vulnerabilities — GLSA **202003-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Mozilla Firefox, the
worst of which may allow execution of arbitrary code.

### Affected packages

| Package | **www-client/firefox** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **68.6.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **68.6.0** |

| Package | **www-client/firefox-bin** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **68.6.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **68.6.0** |

### Background

Mozilla Firefox is a popular open-source web browser from the Mozilla
Project.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla Firefox. Please
review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to view a specially crafted web
page, possibly resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with the
privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition. Furthermore,
a remote attacker may be able to perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the address bar, conduct clickjacking
attacks, bypass security restrictions and protection mechanisms, or have
other unspecified impact.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mozilla Firefox users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-68.6.0"

```

All Mozilla Firefox binary users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=www-client/firefox-bin-68.6.0"

```

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context,

an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,

obtain sensitive information, bypass security restrictions, bypass

same-origin restrictions, conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or

execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11757](/security/CVE-2019-11757), [CVE-2019-11758](/security/CVE-2019-11758), [CVE-2019-11759](/security/CVE-2019-11759),

[CVE-2020-6825](/security/CVE-2020-6825))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain memory operations.

A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of

service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-11745](/security/CVE-2019-11745))

It was discovered that a specially crafted S/MIME message with an inner

encryption layer could be displayed as having a valid signature in some

circumstances, even if the signer had no access to the encrypted message.

An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the message author.

([CVE-2019-11755](/security/CVE-2019-11755))

A heap overflow was discovered in the expat library in Thunderbird. If a

user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker

could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service, or execute

arbitrary code. ([CVE-2019-15903](/security/CVE-2019-15903))

It was discovered that Message ID calculation was based on uninitialized

data. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive

information. ([CVE-2020-6792](/security/CVE-2020-6792))

Mutiple security issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were

tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could

potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive

information, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2020-6793](/security/CVE-2020-6793), [CVE-2020-6795](/security/CVE-2020-6795),

[CVE-2020-6822](/security/CVE-2020-6822))

It was discovered that if a user saved passwords before Thunderbird 60 and

then later set a primary password, an unencrypted copy of these passwords

would still be accessible. A local user could exploit this to obtain

sensitive information. ([CVE-2020-6794](/security/CVE-2020-6794))

It was discovered that the Devtools’ ‘Copy as cURL’ feature did not

fully escape website-controlled data. If a user were tricked in to using

the ‘Copy as cURL’ feature to copy and paste a command with specially

crafted data in to a terminal, an attacker could potentially exploit this

to execute arbitrary commands via command injection. ([CVE-2020-6811](/security/CVE-2020-6811))

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [IMPROPER INPUT VALIDATION CWE-20](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20.html)

A cached side-channel attack during handshakes using RSA encryption could allow for the decryption of content. This is a variant of the adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (AKA Bleichenbacher attack) and affects all Network Security Services (NSS) versions prior to NSS 3.41

[CVE-2018-12404](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-12404) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

#### 3.2.2    [NULL POINTER DEREFERENCE CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html)

In NSS before v3.36.7 and before v3.41.1, a malformed signature can cause a crash due to a NULL dereference, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2018-18508](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2018-18508) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [OUT-OF-BOUNDS WRITE CWE-787](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/787.html)

When encrypting with a block cipher, if a call to NSC\_EncryptUpdate was made with data smaller than the block size, a small out-of-bounds write could occur. This could cause heap corruption and an exploitable crash.

[CVE-2019-11745](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-11745) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [INSUFFICIENT VERIFICATION OF DATA AUTHENTICITY CWE-345](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/345.html)

In NSS before v3.46, several cryptographic primitives had missing length checks. In cases where the application calling the library did not perform a sanity check on the inputs, exploitation of this vulnerability could result in a crash due to a buffer overflow.

[CVE-2019-17006](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-17006) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.5    [IMPROPER CERTIFICATE VALIDATION CWE-295](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295.html)

In NSS before v3.44, a malformed Netscape certificate sequence can cause NSS to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

[CVE-2019-17007](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2019-17007) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

#### 3.2.6    [OUT-OF-BOUNDS READ CWE-125](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html)

An out-of-bounds buffer read flaw was found in the pluto daemon of libreswan from Versions 3.27 to 3.31. An unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to crash libreswan by sending specially crafted IKev1 informational exchange packets. The daemon respawns after the crash.

[CVE-2020-1763](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2020-1763) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Siemens has released the following update and recommends it be applied:

RUGGEDCOM ROX (products listed above): Update to [v2.14.0 or later version](https://support.industry.siemens.com/cs/ww/en/view/109792715/)

Siemens has identified the following specific workarounds and mitigations users can apply to reduce the risk:

* Disable IPsec unless the feature is required in the network environment. Note that IPsec is disabled by default.

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends users protect network access to devices with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens recommends users configure the environment according to [Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial Security](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/operational-guidelines-industrial-security.pdf), and follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Additional information on industrial security by Siemens can be found at: <https://www.siemens.com/industrialsecurity>

For more information see Siemens security advisory [SSA-379803](https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-379803.pdf)

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/tips/ST04-014) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
