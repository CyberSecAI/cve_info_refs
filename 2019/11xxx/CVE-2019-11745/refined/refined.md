{
  "CVE-2019-11745": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "When encrypting with a block cipher, if a call to NSC_EncryptUpdate was made with data smaller than the block size, a small out of bounds write could occur. This could have caused heap corruption and a potentially exploitable crash.",
      "CWE": "CWE-787",
      "Affected Components": [
        "nss"
      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write in the `NSC_EncryptUpdate` function when handling data smaller than a block size in a block cipher encryption.",
      "Vulnerabilities": [
        "Out-of-bounds write when the output buffer is smaller than the block size during block cipher encryption.",
         "Potential heap corruption due to the out-of-bounds write.",
         "Integer overflow in maxout calculation."
      ],
      "Impact": "A remote attacker could potentially trigger a heap-based buffer overflow via SRTP encrypt or decrypt operations, leading to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running the application.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
          "Remote attacker could send specially crafted SRTP encrypt or decrypt operations."
      ],
      "Attacker Capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to perform SRTP encryption or decryption operations. This typically means the attacker is on the network or can inject traffic to the target machine.",
       "Additional Details": [
        "The `NSC_EncryptUpdate` function does not properly check the size of the output buffer against the block size of the cipher during padding.",
        "The integer overflow in maxout calculation could allow an attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory."
      ]
    }
