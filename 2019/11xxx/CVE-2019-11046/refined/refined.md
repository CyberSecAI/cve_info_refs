Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-11046:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the PHP `bcmath` extension, specifically how it handles strings containing characters that are identified as numeric by the operating system but aren't standard ASCII digits.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The `bcmath` functions are susceptible to reading beyond the allocated memory space when provided with non-ASCII numeric-like characters. This happens because the function incorrectly treats these characters as valid digits, which can lead to incorrect memory access.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Information Disclosure:** Exploitation can lead to disclosure of sensitive data from memory locations.
   - **Potential Crash:** Although not explicitly stated in all sources, accessing invalid memory locations can also lead to crashes in some scenarios.
  
**4. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through network requests containing crafted strings with non-ASCII numbers, since this is exposed through the bcmath functions.
   - **Input Manipulation:** An attacker needs to craft specific string inputs that trick the PHP bcmath functions.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **No Special Privileges Needed:** An attacker doesn't require any specific privileges on the target system.
   - **Remote Access:** The attack vector is network-based, implying the attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely.
   - **Knowledge of Vulnerable Functions:** The attacker needs to know that `bcmath` functions are vulnerable, and be able to pass malicious inputs.
   - **Specific PHP Configurations:** The vulnerability affects specific versions (7.2.x before 7.2.26, 7.3.x before 7.3.13, and 7.4.0) and system configurations (including Windows), implying that it may not be exploitable everywhere.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Multiple sources mention that this vulnerability is exploitable when using certain characters on a Windows system, highlighting a potential OS dependency of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability does not impact all versions of PHP, and the fix is implemented by upgrading to secure versions.
*   SUSE and Debian indicate that this vulnerability is rated as "moderate" in severity, while Tenable gives it a "high" risk factor, and a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3, but also as part of a batch with Critical vulnerabilities with a higher base score.
*   Some resources mention that an exploit may require careful crafting of input data and may not be universally successful depending on the system and locale settings.
*   Some vendors also mention other related CVEs, such as CVE-2019-11044, CVE-2019-11045, CVE-2019-11047, CVE-2019-11049, and CVE-2019-11050, that are fixed as part of the same set of updates.

Overall, CVE-2019-11046 is a memory read vulnerability in PHP's bcmath extension, which is exploitable by submitting specially crafted strings with non-ASCII characters that can lead to information disclosure.
