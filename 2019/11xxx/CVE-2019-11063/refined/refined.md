Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2019-11063

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Broken access control in the ASUS SmartHome Android app. Specifically, the app fails to properly authenticate requests, allowing unauthorized access to functionality of the SmartHome system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the lack of authentication for critical API endpoints. This allows an attacker to bypass access controls and interact with the SmartHome system without needing valid credentials.
- **Insecure Communication:** While the updated app version uses SSL, the vulnerability still persists if the attacker targets the app directly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can retrieve sensitive information such as:
    - Usernames added to the HG100 (SmartHome gateway).
    - Details of all devices connected to the HG100.
- **Unauthorized Device Control:** An attacker can control all controllable devices connected to the HG100. This includes actions such as:
    - Unlocking door locks.
    - Controlling meter plugs.
    - Other actions that the app can perform.
- **Account Manipulation:** An attacker can add new users to the HG100 (requires 4-6 digit password, default "0000").

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Proximity:** The attacker must be on the same local network as either:
    - The ASUS SmartHome Gateway (HG100).
    - A mobile device with the ASUS SmartHome app installed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the same internal network as the vulnerable device.
- They need to be able to send HTTP requests to the device or app (potentially over HTTPS as updated).
- No specific user credentials are required to exploit the core vulnerabilities, though password is required to add a new user to the system.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided text states that ASUS released an update that added SSL to HTTP service but the vulnerability still exists. This suggests that the core issue is related to the API logic itself not just the transport protocol.
- The exploit code provided in the repository demonstrates how to perform the attacks using command line options.
- The vulnerability impacts ASUS SmartHome Android App versions prior to 3.0.45_190701.
- The vulnerability is related to CVE-2019-11061, which affects the HG100 device.
