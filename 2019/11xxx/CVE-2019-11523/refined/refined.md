Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11523:

**Root Cause:**
The Anviz M3 RFID Access Control device's communication protocol over TCP/IP lacks authentication and encryption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated Communication:** The device accepts commands from any source on the network without requiring authentication.
*   **Unencrypted Communication:** Data transmitted between the device and a client is not encrypted, making it susceptible to eavesdropping.
*   **Lack of Authorization**: Once a connection is established an attacker can execute any command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Access Control Bypass:** Attackers can send the "open door" command, bypassing access control mechanisms.
*   **Information Leakage:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information such as user lists, including RFID data and passcodes in plaintext.
*   **Data Alteration:** Attackers can modify user data (add, edit, delete users) and access records stored on the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-Based:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the Anviz M3 device over a TCP/IP network. This can be done from a local network or potentially over the internet if the device is exposed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the Anviz M3 device.
*   **Basic Networking Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge of network communication to send commands to the device.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need any prior credentials or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present when the device operates in standalone mode while connected to a TCP/IP network.
*   A Proof-of-Concept (PoC) script (Python and PHP) is available, demonstrating the exploit, and can also be used to scan for vulnerable devices.
*   The vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability and stated it's fixed in the M3 Pro device.
*   Mitigation includes disconnecting the device from the TCP/IP network.

This detailed information aligns with the general description of CVE-2019-11523, providing a more technical explanation of the vulnerability.
