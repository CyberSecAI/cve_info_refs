The provided content describes a privilege escalation vulnerability in M/Monit versions 3.7.2 and earlier, which is fixed in version 3.7.3.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A configuration problem in M/Monit allowed for privilege escalation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the user update mechanism, specifically regarding the `oldpassword` parameter during user updates.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A low-privileged user can gain administrative access to the M/Monit web interface. This allows the attacker to manage and monitor the monitored systems within M/Monit.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed via HTTP POST requests to the `/admin/users/update` endpoint.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs access to the M/Monit web interface with a valid non-administrative user account ("monit" user with password "monit" by default). They also need knowledge of the `oldpassword` parameter's static value.
