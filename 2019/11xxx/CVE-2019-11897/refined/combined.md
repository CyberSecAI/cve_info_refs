## Summary

Recently discovered security vulnerabilities affect the ProSyst mBS SDK and Bosch IoT Gateway Software.
They potentially allow to access sensitive information, write and delete data on the host system and forge HTTP GET request on behalf of the server via the network interface. Bosch rates these vulnerabilities with CVSSv3 base scores from 9.1 (Critical) to 5.3 (Medium), where the actual rating depends on the individual vulnerability and the final rating on the customerâs environment.
Customers are recommended to upgrade to the fixed versions.

As of August 19th, 2019, updated releases are available and offered to all customers via customer support or sales. Depending on the major version in use, a previous update has already fixed some of the vulnerabilities.

As of August 19th, 2019, there is currently no indication that exploitation code is either publicly known or utilized.

The vulnerabilities were discovered and disclosed to Bosch in a coordinated manner by the external researcher Philip Kazmeier.

## Affected Products

* ProSyst mBS SDK < 8.2.6
  + CVE-2019-11601
  + CVE-2019-11897
  + CVE-2019-11602
  + CVE-2019-11603
* Bosch IoT Gateway Software < 9.0.2
  + CVE-2019-11603
* Bosch IoT Gateway Software < 9.2.0
  + CVE-2019-11601
  + CVE-2019-11602
* Bosch IoT Gateway Software < 9.3.0
  + CVE-2019-11897

## Solution

### Software Update

The recommended approach is to update ProSyst mBS SDK and/or Bosch IoT Gateway Software to a fixed version, that is, 8.2.6 and 9.3.0 respectively.

### Mitigations and Workarounds

In cases where an update is not possible, the following mitigations and workarounds are recommended.

**Disable backup and restore functionality**

CVE-2019-11601, CVE-2019-11602, CVE-2019-11897 can be mitigated by disabling the remote backup and restore functionality.

**Adapt mbs.http.pid configuration to effectively disable the corresponding functionality**

CVE-2019-11603 can be mitigated by setting the values of the properties ârootdiraliasâ and ârootdirresourceâ to an empty string in the âmbs.http.pidâ configuration. Then the vulnerability would not be reachable, since the related component would not be activated. The only side effect would be a warning log entry about the failure.

**Firewalling**

It is advised that devices running the ProSyst mBS SDK and Bosch IoT Gateway Software should not be exposed directly to the internet or other insecure networks. This includes port-forwarding, which would not protect the device adequately.

## Vulnerability Details

### CVE-2019-11601 (Backup/Restore)

A directory traversal vulnerability in remote access to backup & restore in earlier version than ProSyst mBS SDK 8.2.6 and Bosch IoT Gateway Software 9.2.0 allows remote attackers to write or delete files at any location.

  + CVSS 3.0 Temporal Score: 8.2 (High)

### CVE-2019-11602 (Backup/Restore)

Leakage of stack traces in remote access to backup & restore in earlier version than ProSyst mBS SDK 8.2.6 and Bosch IoT Gateway Software 9.2.0 allows remote attackers to gather information about the file system structure.

* [CWE-209](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/209.html)
  : Information Exposure Through an Error Message
  + CVSS 3.0 Base Score: 5.3 (Medium),
    [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C)
  + CVSS 3.0 Temporal Score: 5.1 (Medium)

### CVE-2019-11603 (Backup/Restore)

A HTTP Traversal Attack in earlier versions than ProSyst mBS SDK 8.2.6 and Bosch IoT Gateway Software 9.0.2 allows remote attackers to read files outside the http root.

* [CWE-22](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html)
  : Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory (âPath Traversalâ)
  + CVSS 3.0 Base Score: 7.5 (High),
    [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:H/RL:O/RC:C)
  + CVSS 3.0 Temporal Score: 7.2 (High)

### Remark

Vulnerability classification has been performed using the
[CVSSv3 scoring system](http://www.first.org/cvss/)
.
The CVSS environmental score is specific to each customerâs environment and should be defined by the customer to attain a final scoring.
