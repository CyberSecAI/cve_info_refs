Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11190:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in a race condition within the Linux kernel's ELF binary loading process. Specifically, the `install_exec_creds()` function, which is responsible for setting up the credentials for a new executable, is called too late in the `load_elf_binary()` function within `fs/binfmt_elf.c`. This creates a window of opportunity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:**  The `install_exec_creds()` function is called after the executable's memory mappings are set up.
*   **ASLR Bypass:** Due to the late credential setup, a race condition occurs in the `ptrace_may_access()` check which reads `/proc/pid/stat`, allowing a local user to potentially read the memory layout of setuid programs before ASLR can take effect. This lack of randomization makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in setuid programs by bypassing Address Space Layout Randomization.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Specifically, the vulnerability enables information disclosure as the base address of .text and stack can be leaked via `/proc/pid/stat` before proper creds are set

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass ASLR:** Attackers can determine the location of program code and data in memory, which significantly reduces the difficulty of exploiting memory corruption bugs. This allows the user to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization protection.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** This vulnerability makes it easier to exploit setuid programs, which are typically designed to run with elevated privileges.
*  **Information Leak:**  Attackers can leak sensitive addresses from the kernel before proper credentials are set.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the vulnerable system.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to trigger the race condition by reading from /proc/pid/stat within a small window of opportunity after the program starts but before credential installation. This involves carefully timed system calls.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
*  **Ability to Trigger Execve:** The attacker has to have the ability to execute setuid binaries and read `/proc/pid/stat`.
*   **Precise Timing:** Exploitation involves carefully timing actions to read from `/proc/pid/stat` at the correct time during program start.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to the ELF binary format. The vulnerability also affects A.OUT binary format
* The vulnerability is mitigated by preventing unprivileged users from reading performance events (as indicated in some of the provided texts), and has been fixed in newer kernel versions. However, the vulnerability can be still be exploited on older kernels
*   The provided PoC code (`aslrip.c`) demonstrates how this vulnerability can be exploited.
