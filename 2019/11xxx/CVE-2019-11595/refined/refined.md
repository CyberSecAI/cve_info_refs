Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `$rewrite` filter option implemented in certain ad-blocking browser extensions (Adblock Plus, AdBlock, and uBlock - a now deprecated version). This option allows filter list maintainers to redirect network requests. While the intention was to block ads and tracking by redirecting requests within the same origin, the vulnerability arises when combined with a web service that:

1.  Loads and executes JavaScript code using XMLHttpRequest or Fetch.
2.  Does not properly restrict the origins from which it fetches the code (lacks proper Content Security Policy) or validate the final request URL before executing downloaded code.
3.  Has an open redirect on its server, or hosts arbitrary user content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **`$rewrite` filter abuse:** The `$rewrite` functionality in the ad blockers is too powerful, allowing redirection of requests in ways that the web service may not anticipate, leading to injection of malicious content.
*   **Lack of origin restrictions:** Vulnerable web services fail to use CSP `connect-src` headers or validate fetched URLs, allowing them to unknowingly load malicious code from untrusted origins.
*   **Server-side open redirects:** The presence of server-side open redirects enables attackers to bypass origin restrictions and redirect requests to attacker-controlled servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** By manipulating the filter lists, attackers can force a vulnerable web service to load and execute arbitrary JavaScript code, leading to potential data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
*   **Compromise of user sessions:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts that manipulate the webpage, steal user data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Widespread attacks:** Given the large number of users of these ad blockers, the vulnerability could be used to launch large scale attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious filter list updates:** Attackers can inject malicious rules into filter lists, which are periodically updated by the affected browser extensions.
*   **Targeted attacks:** By using the requesting IP address, filter list operators can deliver the malicious payload only to specific targets while keeping the public filter lists intact.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control over a filter list:** Attackers must have the ability to influence or control a filter list used by the vulnerable ad-blocking extensions (directly, or by compromising a filter list maintainer).
*   **Knowledge of vulnerable web services:** Attackers need to know which web services have the exploitable combination of loading code via XMLHttpRequest or Fetch, lacking proper CSP/URL validation, and having an open redirect or user content hosting.
*  **Ability to create malicious filter rules:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious filter rules that will perform the necessary redirects to inject the malicious code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides a concrete example using Google Maps, where the malicious filter rule redirects a JavaScript request to a Google search query that redirects to a server hosting malicious code. This demonstrates the practical exploit.
*   The article also mentions that Google was notified of the exploit but classified the issue as "Intended Behavior". This highlights that the root of the vulnerability is not just in the ad-blocking extension, but also in the web servicesâ€™ lack of proper security practices.
*   The content also notes that uBlock Origin was not vulnerable because it had rejected the $rewrite feature due to security and performance concerns.
