Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- An undisclosed abnormal state within the Micro Focus Content Manager application, specifically when configured to use an Oracle database, triggers the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Exposure:** The vulnerability allows valid system users to access a limited subset of records they would not normally be authorized to view.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Successful exploitation leads to the exposure of sensitive information to users who should not have access to it. The scope of accessible records is described as "limited subset".
- **Potential for Further Compromise:** While the immediate impact is information exposure, this access could potentially be leveraged for further malicious activities, depending on the nature of the exposed data and the system's overall security posture.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Application Misbehavior:** The primary attack vector is an undisclosed abnormal state within the application which exposes data to unauthorized users. 
- **Oracle Database Configuration:** The vulnerability is only applicable when the application is configured to use an Oracle database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid System User:** The attacker must be a valid user of the Content Manager system. This indicates that the vulnerability is likely an access control bypass issue within the application logic, rather than an external attack.
- **No Special Privileges Required:** The user only needs to be an authenticated system user; no elevated privileges are mentioned as a requirement.
- **Knowledge of the abnormal state:** The user needs to be aware of the abnormal state, which seems to be non-trivial and/or not well understood by the user.

**Affected Versions:**
- Micro Focus Content Manager 9.1 prior to 9.1 Patch 6 Hotfix 6
- Micro Focus Content Manager 9.2 prior to 9.2 Patch 3 Hotfix 2
- Micro Focus Content Manager 9.3 prior to 9.3 Patch 2 Hotfix 3

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability can be resolved by upgrading to the specified hotfixes or newer versions for each affected version.

**CVSS Metrics:**
- **CVSS v3 Base Score: 5.4** (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N)
- **CVSS v2 Base Score: 5.5** (AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N)

The CVSS metrics confirm that this is a moderate-severity vulnerability, with low complexity and the requirement of a logged in user on the system for exploitation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vendor has not disclosed the exact nature of the "undisclosed abnormal state", which would be needed for full understanding of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability appears to be related to an issue with access control or data filtering within the Content Manager application when it is using an Oracle database and enters an abnormal state.

This extracted information provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, its impact, and the necessary steps to mitigate the risk.
