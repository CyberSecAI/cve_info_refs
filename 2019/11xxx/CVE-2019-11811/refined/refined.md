  "response": {
    "CVE-2019-11811": {
      "summary": "The vulnerability is a use-after-free in the Linux kernel's IPMI subsystem, specifically in drivers/char/ipmi/ipmi\_si\_intf.c, ipmi\_si\_mem\_io.c, and ipmi\_si\_port\_io.c.",
      "root_cause": "The root cause is improper resource management during module removal. Specifically, when the `ipmi_si` module is removed after a successful `io_setup` but before `ipmi_register_smi`, the allocated resources are not properly freed, leading to a use-after-free.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Use-after-free vulnerability."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to a crash, denial of service, and potentially privilege escalation.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the system is required to trigger the vulnerability by loading and then unloading the `ipmi_si` module, followed by reading from /proc/ioports."
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to load/unload kernel modules and read `/proc/ioports`, implying at least some level of local access and privileges."
