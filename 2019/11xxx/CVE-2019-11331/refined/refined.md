The provided content is related to the concept of NTP port randomization, which aims to mitigate the risk of off-path attacks against NTP. However, it does not describe a specific vulnerability and is therefore **UNRELATED** to CVE-2019-11331.

The content describes a draft document proposing updates to RFC5905, recommending the use of port randomization for NTP modes that don't require the use of a service/well-known port (123). The document explains that using the well-known port in these modes increases the ability of attackers to perform blind/off-path attacks.
