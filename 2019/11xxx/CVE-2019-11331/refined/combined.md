       Port Randomization in the Network Time Protocol Version 4
                  draft-gont-ntp-port-randomization-00

Abstract

   The Network Time Protocol can operate in several modes.  Some of
   these modes are based on the receipt of unsolicited packets, and
   therefore require the use of a service/well-known port as the local
   port number.  However, in the case of NTP modes where the use of a
   service/well-known port is not required, employing such well-known/
   service port unnecessarily increases the ability of attackers to
   perform blind/off-path attacks, since knowledge of such port number
   is typically required for such attacks.  This document formally
   updates [RFC5905](/doc/html/rfc5905), recommending the use of port randomization for those
   modes where use of the NTP service port is not required.

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the oldest Internet
   protocols, and currently specified in [[RFC5905](/doc/html/rfc5905 "\"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification\"")].  Since its its
   original implementation, standardization and deployment, a number of
   vulnerabilities have been found both in the NTP specification and in
   some of its implementations [[NTP-VULN](#ref-NTP-VULN)].  Some of these
   vulnerabilities allow for off-path/blind attacks, where an attacker
   can send forged packets to one or both NTP peers for achieving Denial
   of Service (DoS), time-shifts, and other undesirable outcomes.  Many
   of these attacks require the attacker to guess or know at least a
   target association, typically identified by the tuple {srcaddr,
   srcport, dstaddr, dstport, keyid}. Some of these parameters may be
   easily known or guessed.

   NTP can operate in several modes.  Some of these modes rely on the
   ability to receive unsolicited packets, and therefore require the use
   of a service/well-known port number.  However, for modes where the
   use of a service/well-known port is not required, employing such
   well-known/service port improves the ability of an attacker to
   perform blind/off-path attacks (since knowledge of such port number
   is typically required for such attacks).  This document formally
   updates [RFC5905](/doc/html/rfc5905), recommending the use of port randomization for those
   modes where use of the NTP service port is not required.

[2](#section-2).  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](/doc/html/rfc2119 "\"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\"")].

[3](#section-3).  Update to [RFC5905](/doc/html/rfc5905)

   The specification of the "srcport" and "dstport" peer process
   variables from [Section 9.1](#section-9.1) ("Peer Process Variables") of [[RFC5905](/doc/html/rfc5905 "\"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification\"")] is
   updated as follows:

   srcport: UDP port number of the server or reference clock.  This
   becomes the destination port number in packets sent from this
   association.  When operating in symmetric modes (1 and 2), this field
   must contain the NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In
   other modes, it SHOULD contain a randomized transport-protocol, as
   specified in [[RFC6056](/doc/html/rfc6056 "\"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization\"")].

   dstport: UDP port number of the client.  In the case of broadcast
   server mode (5) and symmetric modes (1 and 2), it must contain the
   NTP port number PORT (123) assigned by the IANA.  In other cases, it
   SHOULD contain a randomized transport-protocol, as specified in
   [[RFC6056](/doc/html/rfc6056 "\"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization\"")].  The value in this variable becomes the source port number
   in packets sent from this association.

[4](#section-4).  IANA Considerations

   There are no IANA registries within this document.  The RFC-Editor
   can remove this section before publication of this document as an
   RFC.

[5](#section-5).  Security Considerations

   The security implications of predictable numeric identifiers
   [[I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids](#ref-I-D.gont-predictable-numeric-ids)] (and of predictable transport-
   protocol port numbers [[RFC6056](/doc/html/rfc6056 "\"Recommendations for Transport- Protocol Port Randomization\"")] in particular) have been known for a
   long time now.  However, the NTP specification have traditionally
   followed a pattern of employing common settings and code even when
   not strictly necessary, which at times has resulted in negative
   security and privacy implications (see e.g.
   [[I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization](#ref-I-D.ietf-ntp-data-minimization)]).  The use of the NTP service port
   (123) for the srcport and dstport variables is not required for all
   operating modes, and such unnecessary usage comes at the expense of
   reducing the amount of work required for an attacker to successfully
   perform off-path/blind attacks against NTP.  Therefore, this document
   formally updates [[RFC5905](/doc/html/rfc5905 "\"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms Specification\"")], recommending the use of transport-
