Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11808:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default session ID generator using a cryptographically weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) within the JDK's `ThreadLocalRandom`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Predictable Session IDs:** The `ThreadLocalRandom` PRNG was not suitable for generating session IDs because it produced predictable sequences if an attacker could determine a narrow window of server start time and obtain a session ID.
- **Lack of System Entropy:** The initial implementation did not use system entropy in the ID generation, making it susceptible to prediction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Session Hijacking:** If an attacker could determine the sequence of session IDs, they could potentially hijack user sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Observation and Prediction:** An attacker would need to observe generated session IDs, determine or make a close guess about the server's start time to predict future session IDs
- **Server-side sessions:** The vulnerability only impacts applications using server-side sessions. Client-side sessions are not vulnerable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Session IDs:** The attacker must be able to obtain valid session IDs that are generated by the vulnerable service.
- **Knowledge of Server Start Time:** Knowledge or a close estimate of the server start time is required to predict future session IDs.
