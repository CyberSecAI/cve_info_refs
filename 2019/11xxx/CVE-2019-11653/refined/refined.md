Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to an access control bypass in the Web Client component of Micro Focus Content Manager.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Access Control Bypass:** The core issue is the ability for an attacker to bypass access controls within the web client.
- **Data Manipulation:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to manipulate data stored during another user's "CheckIn" request. This indicates that the application improperly handles or validates user input related to file check-in operations allowing an attacker to inject malicious data into another user's session.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Modification:** An attacker can modify data associated with another user's file check-in, potentially leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, or unauthorized changes to documents managed by Content Manager.
- **Limited Scope:** The impact is categorized as having "Low" Confidentiality and Integrity impact and no Availability impact, likely meaning only specific parts of data are affected and no service disruptions can occur from this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N), meaning that it can be exploited remotely.
- **Web Client:** The vulnerability lies specifically within the Web Client component of the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker requires a valid user account (PR:L) on the affected system to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of Internal Identifiers:**  The attacker needs to know internal identifiers of target users.
- **Knowledge of File Names:** The attacker needs to know the names of files other users are actively working with.
- **Timing:** The attacker needs to exploit the vulnerability during a limited time window when concurrent user activity is present, this is due to the vulnerability requiring the target user to perform specific file check-in actions.
- **No User Interaction:** The attacker can perform the attack without requiring any user interaction(UI:N).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Content Manager versions 9.1 prior to 9.1.6.6, 9.2 prior to 9.2.3.2, and 9.3 prior to 9.3.2.3.
- The vulnerability was reported to Microfocus by Ashneel Prasad.
- Microfocus released patches to address the vulnerability in the form of Hotfixes for the affected product versions.
