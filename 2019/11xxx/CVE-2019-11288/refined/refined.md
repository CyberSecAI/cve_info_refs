- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JMX Socket Listener in tc Runtime does not properly secure the RMI registry, allowing a local attacker to manipulate it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Insecure RMI registry: The vulnerability lies in the way the JMX Socket Listener manages the RMI registry. The registry can be manipulated by a local attacker, who can perform a man-in-the-middle attack to capture JMX credentials.
    - Lack of proper access control on the RMI registry.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Credential theft: Attackers can intercept usernames and passwords used to access the JMX interface.
    - Full control over tc Runtime instance: By using the stolen credentials, attackers gain complete control of the affected tc Runtime instance.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Local access: The attacker needs local access to the system where tc Runtime is running.
    - Man-in-the-middle attack on the RMI registry: By manipulating the RMI registry, attackers can intercept credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local user account on the system hosting the vulnerable tc Runtime instance.
    - No access to the tc Runtime process or configuration files required.
