Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11736:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The Mozilla Maintenance Service on Windows fails to properly validate hard links when setting permissions in the `updates` directory.  Additionally, there was a race condition in how the Maintenance Service checks for junctions and symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper handling of hard links:** The service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory. This allows an attacker to create a hard link to a file outside the directory and then manipulate its permissions.
- **Race condition:** During checks for junctions and symbolic links, the service has a race condition where it checks for them but does not prevent them from being created or swapped out while the operation is in progress.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privilege escalation:** By exploiting these vulnerabilities, an attacker with local access could replace the Maintenance Service executable, which runs with privileged access (SYSTEM), allowing arbitrary code execution. This is considered a high-severity impact.
- **Local file and directory manipulation:** The race condition allows for undetected local file and directory manipulation, potentially leading to further attacks or system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local system access:** The attacker must have local access to the Windows system.
- **File system manipulation:**  The attacker uses the hard link technique to manipulate permissions of files outside the `updates` directory and exploits the race condition to create a malicious directory structure to be updated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Local user access on the Windows system.
- Ability to create hard links, symlinks, or junctions.
- Ability to trigger the Mozilla Maintenance Service's fix-update-directory-perms function which can be done by starting the 'MozillaMaintenance' service.
