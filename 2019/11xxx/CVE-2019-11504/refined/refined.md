Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11504:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the Zotonic `mod_admin` module. Specifically, the `qcat`, `qcustompivot`, and `qs` parameters in multiple admin URLs are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in the following areas:
- `/admin/overview/` using the `qcat`, `qcustompivot`, and `qs` parameters.
- `/admin/users/` using the `qs` parameter.
- `/admin/media/` using the `qcat`, `qcustompivot`, and `qs` parameters.
The vulnerability is due to the injection of unsanitized user input into HTML templates within the `mod_admin` module.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of an authenticated user's browser. This could lead to:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of the admin panel
- Privilege escalation
- Other malicious actions within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted URLs containing malicious JavaScript code within the vulnerable parameters. These crafted URLs can be delivered to the victim through:
- Phishing emails
- Malicious websites
- Other means of social engineering

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs with XSS payloads in the query parameters `qcat`, `qcustompivot`, and/or `qs`.
- The victim must be an authenticated user with administrative permissions for the Zotonic application.
- The attacker needs to induce the user to visit the crafted URL through phishing or other social engineering methods.

**Additional Notes:**
- The exploit-db content provides a good example of a vulnerable URL: `https://[host]/admin/overview?qcustompivot="><script>prompt(‘XSS’)</script>`
- The provided documentation also mentions the affected files within the Zotonic source code: `zotonic_mod_admin_identity\priv\templates\_admin_sort_header.tpl` and `zotonic_mod_admin_identity\priv\templates\admin_users.tpl`
- The vulnerability was fixed in Zotonic version 0.47.0.
