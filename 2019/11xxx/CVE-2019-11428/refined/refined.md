Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `export_files` GET parameter in the `export.php` script. The value of this parameter is directly used in a hidden input field's `value` attribute without escaping, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected XSS:** The application takes user input from the URL parameter `export_files` and reflects it back in the HTML output without proper sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
- **Lack of input sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or encode the input provided through the `export_files` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which can then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking: Attacker can steal user session cookies.
    - Phishing: An attacker can redirect the user to a fake login page.
    - Defacement: Attacker can change the visual appearance of the page.
    - Data theft: An attacker can access sensitive data displayed on the page.
    - Malware distribution: Attacker can redirect the user to download malware.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a specially crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the `export_files` parameter.
- The attacker would need to trick a user into clicking this malicious link to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload.
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver this malicious link to a victim. This could be done via email, social media or other communication channels.

**Additional details:**

- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) demonstrating how the vulnerability can be exploited. The POC is: `https://i-librarian.net/demo/export.php?export_files="><script>alert(1)</script>`. This URL, when visited, will execute the alert(1) JavaScript code, proving the vulnerability exists.
- The vulnerability is located in the `export.php` file.
- The code snippet demonstrates how the unsanitized `$_GET['export_files']` parameter is assigned to the variable `$get_post_export_files`, and then used in the HTML code without proper escaping: `<input type="hidden" name="export_files" value="<?php print $get_post_export_files ?>">`
