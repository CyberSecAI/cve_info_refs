    "related": true,
    "info": "The provided content details a remote command execution vulnerability in Liferay CE Portal versions prior to 7.1.2 ga3.\n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability stems from the Liferay CE Portal's Groovy script console, which allows for the execution of arbitrary OS commands through the `[command].execute()` method within a Groovy script.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Unrestricted access to the Groovy script console for users with application administrator privileges.\n- The ability to execute arbitrary OS commands using the `execute()` method within Groovy scripts.\n- Lack of proper input validation or sanitization in the Groovy script execution process.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- An attacker with application administrator credentials can execute arbitrary OS commands on the server, potentially leading to:\n  - Full compromise of the Liferay server.\n  - Data exfiltration or manipulation.\n  - Installation of malware or backdoors.\n  - Denial of service.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- The attack vector is through the Liferay CE Portal's web interface, specifically the Groovy script console, which is accessible to application administrators.\n- The attacker needs to authenticate to the portal with valid administrative credentials.\n- The attacker then crafts a malicious Groovy script that contains the command to be executed and sends it to the server.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- The attacker requires a valid username and password for an application administrator account on the target Liferay CE Portal.\n- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Liferay server.\n\n**Additional details:**\n- The provided exploit code is a Metasploit module.\n- The exploit first logs into the Liferay portal and then sends a crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious Groovy script to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.\n- The module is capable of executing various reverse shell payloads such as `cmd/unix/reverse`, `reverse_ruby`, `reverse_python` or `reverse_perl`.\n- The module also performs a check to identify the vulnerable Liferay version based on the `Liferay-Portal` header of the response."
