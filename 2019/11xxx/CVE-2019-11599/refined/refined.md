{
  "CVE-2019-11599": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in the Linux kernel's core dump implementation, where locking or other mechanisms are not used to prevent vma layout or flags changes during core dump. This leads to a potential use-after-free.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Race condition",
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A local attacker can potentially read sensitive information, cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or achieve privilege escalation.",
    "Attack vectors": "Local access to the system",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local attacker"
  }
}
