Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11701:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the default `webcal:` protocol handler in Firefox. This handler was configured to use a third-party website, `30boxes.com`, which had an XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **XSS Vulnerability:** The `30boxes.com` website was vulnerable to XSS attacks. Firefox was configured to redirect `webcal:` URLs to this site, passing the URL as a parameter. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the URL, which would then be executed in the context of the `30boxes.com` website when the user clicked on a specially crafted `webcal:` link.
*   **Default Protocol Handler Misconfiguration:**  Firefox's default configuration included a `webcal:` protocol handler pointing to a vulnerable third-party service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the vulnerable website (`30boxes.com`).
*   **Redirect:** The provided proof of concept (PoC) used the XSS to redirect the user to a different website, demonstrating the potential for phishing.
*   **Potential for Malicious Actions:** While the PoC demonstrated a redirect, the arbitrary JavaScript execution could be used for more malicious purposes, such as stealing cookies or performing other actions on behalf of the user within the 30boxes.com domain.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted `webcal:` URLs:** An attacker crafts a malicious `webcal:` URL that contains JavaScript code.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking on the malicious `webcal:` URL. This could be done through email, instant messaging, or embedding the link on a webpage.
*   **Redirection to Vulnerable Site:** When the user clicks the link, Firefox redirects the user to the vulnerable `30boxes.com` website, appending the malicious URL as a parameter.
*   **XSS Execution:** The vulnerable website executes the injected JavaScript code from the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious `webcal:` URLs containing the XSS payload.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick users into clicking on these malicious URLs.
*   **No Direct Access to Firefox Required:** The attacker doesn't need any direct access to the user's Firefox installation. The vulnerability is exploited through a specially crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was considered low severity because it required an account on the vulnerable third-party service (`30boxes.com`) to have a significant impact.
*   The fix involved removing the default `webcal:` handler for the vulnerable site.
*   The issue was fixed in Firefox 67 by removing the vulnerable handler.
*   The bug report also mentions that a similar issue was previously addressed in Bug 1252831 related to the 30boxes.com certificate.
