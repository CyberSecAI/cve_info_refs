Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient boundary checks in the `number_format` function when formatting numbers. The `snprintf` function, used to format the number, can return a value greater than the number of bytes copied. When the first character of the formatted string was not a digit (e.g. a minus sign), the size of a temporary string (`tmpstr`) was updated without proper bounds checking against the length returned by `snprintf`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read/write access to memory. Specifically, a heap overflow can occur if the assertion is not compiled during the build process.
- When the assertion is compiled, it can cause a crash.
- The vulnerability is present in how the temporary buffer size is handled after `snprintf`, leading to incorrect size calculations and memory access issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential remote code execution (RCE).
- Denial of service (DoS) due to crashes (especially in builds where assertions are compiled).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The `number_format()` function, which is part of HHVM's string formatting functionality.
- By crafting specific inputs (e.g. a double number that results in a formatted string that starts with a non-digit character), an attacker can trigger the vulnerability and cause a heap overflow

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to execute code that calls the vulnerable `number_format()` function with maliciously crafted input.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within an application using HHVM.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit diff shows a fix for the vulnerability by adding a condition to the size check: `if (tmplen < 64 && (tmpbuf == nullptr || !isdigit((int)tmpbuf[0]))) {`.
- This fix ensures that the size of `tmpstr` is only updated if the length returned by snprintf is less than 64 and the formatted string does not start with a digit.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of HHVM as outlined in the Facebook advisory.
