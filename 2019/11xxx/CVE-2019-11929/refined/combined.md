string\_number\_format: Correctly handles return value of snprintf

```
Summary: `snprintf` can return a value greater than the number of bytes copied. In case the first byte of the string is not a digit (could be '-'), size of `tmpstr` was being updated without checking `tmplen`. This resulted in either an assertion error or a heap overflow depending on whether the assertion is compiled or not.

# Meta Open Source - Terms of Use

*Effective December 1, 2020*

These Terms of Use ("**Terms**") govern your use of this website hosted and provided by Meta Platforms, Inc. ("**Meta**", "**us**" or "**we**"), ("**Website**") and any services offered through the Website ("**Services**").

These Terms are a legal contract between you and us so it is important that you review them carefully.

For clarity, these Terms only apply to this Website and do not apply to any:

1. use of open source code, documentation or specifications made available on GitHub, which are governed by the terms of the applicable open source license;
2. pull requests, issues and any other interactions or features related to participation in open source projects on GitHub, which are governed by GitHub's terms and conditions; or
3. use of any other Meta website, service or product, which are governed by the terms and conditions applicable to those offerings.

We may change these Terms or modify any features of the Website or the Services at any time. Any such change or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on our Website. You accept these Terms by browsing this Website and/or using the Services, and you accept any changes to the Terms by continuing to use the Website after we post any such changes.

If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not access or use the Website.

If you need to contact us for any reason, please do so at opensource@meta.com

#### 1. What you can do on this Website

We make this Website available to you and others to help everyone better understand our open source projects. In exchange, we need you to make the following commitments:

**(a) Who can use the Website**

We try to make our Website broadly available to everyone, but you cannot use our Website if:

* You are a minor in your country of residence except if your parents or guardians have agreed to these Terms on your behalf.
* You are prohibited from accessing the Website under applicable laws.

**(b) What you can share and do on the Website**

You agree not to engage in the conduct described below (or to facilitate or support others in doing so):

1. You may not use our Website, do or share anything:
   * That violates these Terms (and other terms and policies that apply to your use of the Website);
   * That is unlawful in any country, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent; and/or
   * That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.
2. You may not upload viruses or malicious code or do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working or appearance of the Services or Website.

**(c) Access to the Website**

The Website is made available free of charge and the Services are available only for informational purposes. We make no representations or warranties of any kind as to the accuracy, currency, or completeness of the information and other materials made available through the Website and are not liable for any decisions you may make in reliance on this content.

#### 2. Links To Third-Party Content

The Website or Services may contain links to third-party content. For example, our user communities may be hosted by third party platforms over which we have no control and for which we have no responsibility. Therefore, please review each of these platforms or websites' terms of use and privacy policies before participating.

We do not control, endorse, sponsor, recommend, or otherwise accept responsibility for any content, terms of use, policies on or use of any third party website.

#### 3. Limits on Liability

We work hard to provide the best Website and Services we can and to specify clear guidelines for everyone who uses them. Our Website and Services, however, are provided "as is," and we make no guarantees that they always will be safe, secure, or error-free, that they will function without disruptions, delays, or imperfections or content will be accurate, current and complete. To the extent permitted by law, we also DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT IN RELATION TO THE WEBSITE, THE SERVICES AND THEIR CONTENT. We do not control or direct what people and others do or say, and we are not responsible for their actions or conduct (whether online or offline) or any content they share (including offensive, inappropriate, obscene, unlawful, and other objectionable content). Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of implied warranties, in which case parts of this disclaimer may not apply to you.

We cannot predict when issues might arise with our Website and Services. Accordingly, our liability shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and under no circumstance will we be liable to you for any lost profits, revenues, information, or data, or consequential, special, indirect, exemplary, punitive, or incidental damages arising out of or related to these Terms, the Website or the Services, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. Our aggregate liability arising out of or relating to these Terms, the Website or the Services will not exceed $100.

We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so therefore depending on the country where you reside some of these exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.

#### 4. Disputes

We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute does arise, however, it's useful to know up front where it can be resolved and what laws will apply.

For any claim, cause of action, or dispute you have against us that arises out of or relates to these Terms, the Website and/or the Services ("**claim**"), you agree that it will be resolved exclusively in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California or a state court located in San Mateo County. You also agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of either of these courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim, and that the laws of the State of California will govern these Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.

The preceding provision regarding applicable law and venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, these Terms will be subject to the laws of your country of residence and you may bring a claim in front of those courts.

#### 5. Privacy

Under data protection legislation, we are required to provide you with certain information about who we are, how we process your personal data and for what purposes and your rights in relation to your personal data and how to exercise them. This information is provided in our [Privacy Policy](/legal/privacy) and it is important that you read that information. Please also review our [Cookie Policy](/legal/cookie-policy), which tells you which cookies we use on the Website and how to manage them.

#### 6. Other important terms

These Terms make up the entire agreement between you and Meta Platforms, Inc. regarding your use of our Services and this Website. They supersede any prior agreements.

If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to enforce any of these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in writing and signed by us.

You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our consent.

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and us as a result of these Terms or your access to and use of the Website or Services.

These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these Terms are freely assignable by us in connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.

We reserve all rights not expressly granted to you.
