- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper access control on email notifications for commit comments. Despite the project having "internal" visibility and comments being restricted to "Team Members," a user who is not a team member but has subscribed to all events of another user can receive email notifications containing private commit titles and comments.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Information Disclosure: Private commit titles and comments are leaked to unauthorized users via email notifications.
    - Improper Access Control: Email notifications are sent to users who are not part of the project team, bypassing the intended visibility settings.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can view private commit titles and comments that should only be visible to team members of a project with internal visibility.
- **Attack vectors:**
    - User subscribes to all events of a victim user.
    - The victim user makes a comment on a commit within an internal project.
    - Email notification containing the commit title and comment is sent to the attacker, who is not a team member.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs a GitLab account.
    - The attacker needs to find a victim user and subscribe to their events within GitLab.
    - The victim user needs to create an internal project and comment on a commit in that project.
