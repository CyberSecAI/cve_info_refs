The provided content details multiple vulnerabilities in doorGets CMS V7.0, including CVE-2019-11607.

Here's a breakdown of the information related to **CVE-2019-11607**:

**Vulnerability:** Sensitive information disclosure

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `\fileman\php\copydir.php` file.
- There is a lack of permission verification, allowing unauthenticated users to access this functionality.
- The `copyDir` function does not properly filter the `$newPath` and `$path` variables, which allows for directory traversal.

**Weakness:**
- Insecure direct object reference due to missing permission checks.
- Insufficient input validation on the `$newPath` and `$path` parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can copy arbitrary directories to the `/fileman/` directory
- This allows the attacker to access sensitive files and directories that they shouldn't have access to, leading to sensitive information disclosure.

**Attack Vector:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can send a crafted POST request to the `copydir.php` script with directory traversal sequences in the `d` and `n` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities:**
- The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable doorGets instance. No prior authentication or specific privileges are required.

**Technical Details:**
- The `copydir.php` script takes a `d` parameter, representing the source directory to copy, and a `n` parameter, representing the destination directory.
- The `copyDir` function creates a new directory and then copies the files, but does not validate directory traversals in $newPath or $path. This allows a crafted request such as:

```
POST /fileman/php/copydir.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8003
...
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8
...

d=%2Ffileman%2FUploads%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Ftong%2Fphpstudy%2FPHPTutorial%2FApache%2Fconf&n=%2Ffileman%2FUploads%2F..
```

- By manipulating the `d` and `n` parameters, an attacker can copy a directory from outside the webroot to the /fileman directory (e.g., /conf).
- The copied content can then be accessed through the web server (e.g., `http://domain.com/fileman/conf/httpd.conf`).
