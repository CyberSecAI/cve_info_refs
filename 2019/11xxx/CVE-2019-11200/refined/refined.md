This document provides details about multiple vulnerabilities found in Dolibarr ERP & CRM version 9.0.1. One of these vulnerabilities is related to CVE-2019-11200.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CVE-2019-11200:** Insufficient input sanitization and validation of the `mysqldump` export parameter within the backup functionality. Specifically, the application uses a regular expression to check if the provided command is within the list of allowed commands but this check can be bypassed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CVE-2019-11200:** Remote code execution due to insufficient sanitization of the `mysqldump` parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **CVE-2019-11200:** Remote code execution on the server, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the context of the webserver user (e.g., `www-data`). This can lead to complete server compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CVE-2019-11200:** A low-privileged user can upload a malicious file, then manipulate the `mysqldump` parameter during a database backup to execute the uploaded file. The attacker utilizes a shell variable `$IFS` to bypass space filtering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **CVE-2019-11200:** A low-privileged user account is needed to upload a malicious file and initiate a backup with the manipulated `mysqldump` parameter.
