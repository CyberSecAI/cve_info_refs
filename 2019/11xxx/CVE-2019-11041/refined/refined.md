  "CVE-2019-11041": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Severity": "Critical",
      "Description": "When PHP EXIF extension is parsing EXIF information from an image, e.g. via exif_read_data() function, in PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.31, 7.2.x below 7.2.21 and 7.3.x below 7.3.8 it is possible to supply it with data what will cause it to read past the allocated buffer. This may lead to information disclosure or crash."
    },
    "Root cause": "Heap buffer over-read in the exif_scan_thumbnail() function due to insufficient bounds checking when processing EXIF data of an image.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Heap buffer over-read",
	"Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A crafted image could lead to information disclosure or a denial-of-service (crash).",
    "Attack vector": "By providing a specially crafted image with malicious EXIF data.",
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted image to an application that uses the vulnerable PHP EXIF extension."
