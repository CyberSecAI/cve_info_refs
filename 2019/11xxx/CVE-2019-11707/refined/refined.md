Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11707:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a type confusion error within the IonMonkey JavaScript engine's optimization of `Array.prototype.pop()`. Specifically, IonMonkey incorrectly predicts the return type of `Array.pop()` when the array's prototype chain is modified.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Type Confusion:** IonMonkey's JIT compiler infers that `Array.pop()` will always return an object when it encounters it, and optimizes the code accordingly. However, when the prototype of the array is changed to another object that has a non-object value at the index to be popped, the type assumption is violated.
- **Incorrect Inlining:** The `Array.pop()` call is inlined by IonMonkey, and converted into an `MArrayPopShift` instruction without proper type checks. It relies on the inferred types, and omits the necessary type barrier.
- **Missing Prototype Consideration:** The inlined version of `Array.pop()` fails to account for the possibility of the array's prototype having a property at the index being popped. This allows values from the prototype chain to be returned instead of the values from the array itself, which could cause type mismatches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exploitable Crash:**  The type confusion leads to an exploitable crash because the JIT-compiled code dereferences a non-object value as a pointer, leading to a crash at an attacker-controlled address.
- **Arbitrary Memory Write:** By carefully crafting the prototype chain and the objects involved, it is possible to achieve arbitrary memory writes, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted JavaScript:** The vulnerability is triggered by executing a specially crafted JavaScript code in a context where JIT compilation is performed.
- **Prototype Modification:** The attacker needs to modify the prototype of an array, such as `v4`, to include a property that causes the type confusion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to execute JavaScript code:** The attacker needs to be able to run JavaScript code within the vulnerable environment (e.g. web page).
- **Control over Object Properties:** The attacker needs to be able to modify the prototype chain of an array, setting up a condition that causes the type confusion to occur when pop is invoked on it.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was found through fuzzing and manually modified.
- The initial PoC crashed the browser, while a modified PoC was able to achieve arbitrary memory writes.
- The bug was present in Firefox 66.0.3 and other versions.
- A fix involves calling `ElementAccessHasExtraIndexedProperty` instead of `ArrayPrototypeHasIndexedProperty` when inlining array natives. This ensures that prototype chain is correctly checked.
- The vulnerability was rated "critical" and was actively being exploited in the wild
- It was fixed in Firefox 67.0.3, Firefox ESR 60.7.1, and Thunderbird 60.7.2
