Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-11782:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient validation of wizard parameters in the "Portal Access Management" wizard within the Odoo Portal module. This lack of validation allows modification of user accounts by unauthorized users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** The core issue is that users with limited privileges (e.g., Sales Representatives) can use the "Portal Access Management" wizard to modify user accounts, which they should not be able to do.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A malicious employee with access to contact management can modify the contact information of another user, potentially taking over their account. This can lead to a full privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Exploitable:** The vulnerability can be exploited over a network.
- **Authentication Required:**  Exploitation requires an employee or internal user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated employee or internal user with access to the contact management functionality within Odoo.
- The attacker must be able to craft a special request to exploit the insufficient validation of the wizard parameters.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Versions:**  Odoo Community and Enterprise Editions 14.0 and earlier are affected.
- **CVSS Score:**  8.1 (High)
- **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N

**Mitigation:**
