Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11724:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an outdated permission setting in Firefox that granted unnecessary "remote-troubleshooting" access to the retired website input.mozilla.org.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unnecessary permission: The browser was configured to grant elevated privileges to a site that was no longer in use and was redirecting to another website.
- Potential attack vector: This exposed an attack vector for malicious attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact was considered low but with potential malicious vector. The vulnerable configuration could potentially allow a malicious actor to leverage the additional permissions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the use of the `input.mozilla.org` site, exploiting its previously granted permissions even though the site was retired and redirecting to another one.
- While not clearly defined how to exploit the remote-troubleshooting permission, the possibility of malicious use was the main concern.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to leverage the outdated permissions assigned to input.mozilla.org through some attack vector that is not defined
- An attacker capable of leveraging the extra "remote-troubleshooting" permissions, however no clear way of exploitation is discussed

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to a retired domain retaining permissions in Firefox, a simple configuration oversight.
- The fix involved removing this permission from the browser's configuration for `input.mozilla.org`.
- The vulnerability is specific to Firefox versions prior to 68.
- SUSE considers this as having "important" severity
- NVD rates this as having a 6.1 (Medium) CVSS v3 score and 5.8 CVSS v2 score. The SUSE CVSSv3 rating is 5.8, with an Attack Complexity of High, compared to NVD rating which has an Attack Complexity of Low.
- The vulnerability is also noted as related to bug 1512511 in bugzilla.mozilla.org
- The fix is to remove the extra-privileges for `input.mozilla.org`
