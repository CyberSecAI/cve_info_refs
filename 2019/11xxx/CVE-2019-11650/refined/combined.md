Advanced Authentication now supports the Google reCAPTCHA as a policy. Using reCAPTCHA, you can prevent the bot attacks on Advanced Authentication web portals by confirming that the user trying to log in is a human, not a robot. This adds an additional layer of security before users perform the multi-factor authentication.

For more information, see [Google reCAPTCHA Options](../../server-administrator-guide/data/configuring_policy.html#t456p1texdr7) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Web Authentication Method

Advanced Authentication facilitates the use of identity providers for OAuth 2.0, SAML, and OpenID Connect for web authentication. Administrators can configure the method with any of the identity providers. Users must enroll with any of these identity providers and get authenticated through them.

For more information, see [Web Authentication Method](../../server-administrator-guide/data/configuring_method.html#t45gug0lime6) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Support for Windows Hello

Advanced Authentication now supports the Windows Hello authentication with the Fingerprint authenticator on the Windows 10 machine.

For more information, see [Windows Hello](../../server-administrator-guide/data/configuring_method.html#t457nmrhu4rq) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### New Reporting Portal

Advanced Authentication now provides a new Reporting portal. Administrators can add new reports and customize the existing reports on this portal. The new reports provide information about enrolled users, authenticators, and so on with better graphical representation.

For more information, see [Reporting](../../server-administrator-guide/data/advanced_authentication_server_maintenance.html#advanced_authentication_server_maintenance) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### ADFS Multi-Factor Authentication Plug-in

A new Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) plug-in has been introduced to enable the multi-factor functionality for Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS). In comparison with the old ADFS plug-in, the new plug-in has been implemented as a standard extension for ADFS.

For more information, see the [Advanced Authentication - ADFS MFA plug-in](../../adfs-plugin-installation/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Windows Authentication Agent

Authentication Agent allows you to perform strong multi-factor authentication on one computer to get authorized access to another computer where it is not possible to display the user interface or connect any external authentication devices. You can install the Authentication Agent on a workstation or laptop. When an authentication is initiated from a computer using Authentication Agent chain, the Authentication Agent on another computer prompts a restricted browser where user must perform authentication.

For more information, see [Authentication Agent](../../server-user-guide/data/t462mn43o1oh.html#t462mn43o1oh) in the [Advanced Authentication- User](../../server-user-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

#### Tokens Management Portal

Advanced Authentication introduces a new portal where a Helpdesk administrator can upload a batch file that contains multiple tokens and can assign a token to specific users for the OATH authentication method.

For more information, see [Helpdesk Options](../../server-administrator-guide/data/configuring_policy.html#helpdesk_options) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

##### Policy to Hide a Required Chain

Advanced Authentication introduces the Linked Chain policy that allows administrators to hide the required (high security) chain after users authenticate with the required chain within a grace period. With this policy, only the linked chain is displayed to the users in place of both the required and linked chain within the grace period.

For more information, see [Linked Chains](../../server-administrator-guide/data/configuring_policy.html#t45nb7c049oj) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

##### New Fingerprint Matching Service

Advanced Authentication now uses the NBIS as a fingerprint matching engine in the server. The new engine improves the quality of fingerprint recognition, specially for inexpensive swipe sensors.

*NOTE:*After migrating from Advanced Authentication v5, users may need to re-enroll the Fingerprint authenticators if they have enrolled the authenticators on the WBF compliant readers. This is because, the previous authenticators may contain low quality fingerprint images. Re-enrollment for the Lumidigm and Digital Persona readers is not required.

##### Option to Bypass User Lockout in Repository

Previously, users locked in a repository (Active Directory) were not able to authenticate on Advanced Authentication. Now, administrator can allow users who are locked in a repository to authenticate on Advanced Authentication using the Bypass user lockout in repository option in Events. This option may be required for integrations such as Self Service Password Reset integration.

*Fix:*
Now, users can provide only the host name to send a request to the server to receive appropriate response.

#### NetIQ Access Manager 4.4 Authentication Fails Due To URL Redirection

*Issue:*
When users log in to NetIQ Access Manager 4.4 in path based acceleration setup, the Access Gateway forwards the request to the Self-Service portal URL (https://<aa server>/account/). Advanced Authentication server performs URL redirection and provides a redirect URL without trailing backslash (https://<aa server>/account), Access Gateway adds trailing backslash to the redirect URL, which causes a loop and the valid page is not displayed. (Bug 1062262)

*Fix:*
Now, valid URLs (with or without trailing backslash) of a specific page is mapped to the relevant HTML page.

#### Password Synchronization Message Updated

When a user log in to Windows workstation using the Windows Client for the first time, a message that prompts the user to synchronize the password is updated to Password must be synchronized. (Bug 1030020)

#### Unable to View the Workstation Name on the Login Screen

In the Windows Client, when a user specifies backslash (\) in User name, a message Sign in to <workstation name> is not displayed. (Bug 1063099)

#### WebAuth Service Issue with Self Service Password Reset

*Issue:*
After a successful login to the Self Service Password Reset (SSPR) service through Advanced Authentication, an idle WebAuth session is active in the background. After a duration of one hour, if a user tries to access SSPR again, the WebAuth service displays an error message Access Denied due to the endpoint session timeout. (Bug 1049204)

*Fix:*
When users try to access Self Service Password Reset, a new WebAuth session is initiated to allow users to access the Self Service Password Reset service.

#### Issue with the OAuth 2.0 Event

*Issue:*
When a user logs in to the OAuth 2.0 event, an error message Invalid authentication method is not displayed though one of the following condition is true:

* Chain is not assigned to the OAuth event.
* User has not enrolled to the method that is assigned to the OAuth event. (Bug 1047448)

*Fix:*
With this release, if the method is not assigned or methods available in the chain are not enrolled, a valid message is displayed.

This release also addresses a potential Man in the Middle (MITM) attack in the versions prior to Advanced Authentication 6.0. Special thanks to Octav Opaschi, of Detack GMBH, for responsibly disclosing this to us. (CVE-2019-11650)

## 3.0 Upgrading

Upgrading Advanced Authentication 5.6 to 6.0 is not supported. However, you can export the configurations from Advanced Authentication 5.6.341 to 6.0. After you install Advanced Authentication 6.0, you can import all the configurations from 5.6.341.

For example, to upgrade from Advanced Authentication 5.5 to 6.0, you must first upgrade from Advanced Authentication 5.5 to 5.6.341. Then, you must install 6.0 and import the configurations from 5.6.341.

For more information about upgrading, see [Migrating Advanced Authentication to 6.0](https://www.netiq.com/documentation/advanced-authentication-60/install-upgrade-guide/data/upgrading.html) in the [Advanced Authentication- Server Installation and Upgrade](../../install-upgrade-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

*NOTE:* This release discontinues the ADFS plug-in. You can configure integration with ADFS using the ADFS MFA Plug-in or through SAML. For more information, see [Configuring Integration with ADFS](../../server-administrator-guide/data/t439938mc6cr.html#t439938mc6cr) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide and [Advanced Authentication - ADFS MFA plug-in](../../adfs-plugin-installation/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide.

After migrating from Advanced Authentication v5, users may need to re-enroll the Fingerprint authenticators if they have enrolled the authenticators on the WBF compliant readers. This is because, the previous authenticators may contain low quality fingerprint images. Re-enrollment for the Lumidigm and Digital Persona readers is not required.
