    "description": "If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any javascript: URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
