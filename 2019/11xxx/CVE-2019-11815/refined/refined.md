Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11815:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
The content is relevant to CVE-2019-11815. Several sources mention this CVE ID in relation to a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's RDS TCP implementation.  Specifically, the commit message from `git.kernel.org` and the openSUSE security update both explicitly refer to this CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability**

*   The root cause is a race condition in the `rds_tcp_kill_sock` function of the Linux kernel's Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol's TCP transport layer. Specifically, when a network namespace is being cleaned up, `rds_tcp_exit_net` calls `rds_tcp_kill_sock`. If `tc->t_sock` is NULL, the connection is not properly cleaned up (i.e. `rds_conn_destroy()`, `rds_conn_path_destroy()`, and `rds_tcp_conn_free()` are not called), and the worker thread (`cp_conn_w`) is not stopped.
*  This lack of proper cleanup can lead to a use-after-free condition because the worker thread can continue to execute, potentially calling `rds_tcp_conn_path_connect()` which references the freed network namespace, resulting in a use-after-free.
*   The `rds_tcp_conn_path_connect` function sets `t_sock` but it could be set to NULL again if the connection fails. In the event of persistent connection failures, the cleanup will not be triggered, leading to the resource leak. The check `!tc->t_sock` in `rds_tcp_kill_sock` prevents proper cleanup in the aforementioned situation.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**

*   **Use-after-free:** The primary vulnerability is a use-after-free occurring due to improper cleanup of network namespace resources.
*   **Race condition:** The issue is triggered by a race condition during network namespace cleanup and connection attempts.
*   **Resource Leak:** The resource leak due to unstopped worker can trigger use-after-free, and potentially memory leak.

**4. Impact of exploitation**

*   **Denial of service (DoS):** The use-after-free can cause a system crash, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Arbitrary code execution (Possible):** As the SUSE security advisory states, there is a possibility of arbitrary code execution as consequence of this vulnerability, though that is not explicitly detailed in the provided content.
*   **Information Leak (Indirect):** The openSUSE advisory mentions other CVEs, such as CVE-2018-7191 and CVE-2019-11884 which suggest information leaks are possible from similar issues.

**5. Attack vectors**

*   **Local:** The primary attack vector described is local, as it requires the ability to trigger a network namespace cleanup and cause a connection attempt to fail, and then read from the freed memory. 
*  **Network (Indirect):**  Although the primary trigger is a local cleanup operation, the vulnerability is related to a network protocol (RDS over TCP), meaning that an attacker on the same network may influence the connection behaviour.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to trigger the race condition by creating a new network namespace and triggering connection failures, or unload modules that result in the described issue.  In some cases, root privileges may be needed to create new network namespaces.
*   **RDS enabled:** The RDS protocol must be enabled on the system for the exploit to occur. As noted in multiple documents, the RDS protocol is typically disabled by default in Ubuntu.
*  **Network Control**: While mostly a local vulnerability, the attacker may require some level of control over network connectivity to make the connections fail, which is a prerequisite for triggering the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the content**

* The `git.kernel.org` content shows the patch that fixes the use-after-free by removing the unnecessary condition in rds\_tcp\_kill\_sock function, forcing destruction of the connection if net namespaces is being cleaned up.
* The `lists.opensuse.org` content shows that the vulnerability was addressed in the openSUSE Leap 15.1 kernel update.
* The `www.suse.com` content shows the vulnerability was addressed in several SUSE products (including Enterprise Linux Server, Enterprise Linux Desktop, and related modules) and that the CVSS score was 6.4 for SUSE vs 8.1 for NVD. It also specifies the SUSE bugzilla entry related to the issue.
* `usn.ubuntu.com` indicates that the issue was addressed in the Ubuntu kernel as well, and it also notes that the RDS protocol is disabled by default.
* The vulnerability was addressed with a kernel patch that forces connection destruction even when the `t_sock` member is NULL.
