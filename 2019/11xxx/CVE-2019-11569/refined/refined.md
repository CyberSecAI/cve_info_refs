  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Veeam ONE Reporter application does not properly validate requests, allowing for Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform arbitrary actions on the Veeam ONE Reporter application by tricking an authenticated user into submitting malicious requests. This includes actions like deleting dashboards, editing settings, or performing other administrative tasks.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious web page containing a form that submits a request to the vulnerable Veeam ONE Reporter application. When an authenticated user visits this page, the form is automatically submitted, executing the attacker's desired action.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to lure an authenticated user to visit a malicious web page they control. The user must be logged into the Veeam ONE Reporter application for the attack to succeed."
