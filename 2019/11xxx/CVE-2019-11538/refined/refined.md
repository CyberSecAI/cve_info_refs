{
  "CVE-2019-11538": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability in the Network File Share (NFS) of Pulse Connect Secure.",
    "Weaknesses": "The script `/dana/fb/nfs/nfb.cgi` does not check whether the accessed file is a symlink or not, allowing access to arbitrary files through symbolic links on the remote NFS server.",
    "Impact": "An authenticated end-user attacker can access the contents of arbitrary files on the local file system.",
     "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to control files on a remote NFS server and create symbolic links pointing to files they wish to access on the Pulse Connect Secure appliance. The attacker then accesses this symlink via the web interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "Authenticated end-user access and the ability to manipulate files on a remote NFS server."
  }
