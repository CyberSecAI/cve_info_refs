Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2019-11625:

**CVE-2019-11625:**

*   **Vulnerability:** SQL Injection
*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability lies in the `doorgets\app\requests\user\emailingRequest.php` file. The application directly inserts the key/value pairs from POST data into a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, line 119 is vulnerable.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation and sanitization for data used in SQL queries. The application directly incorporates user-controlled data into the query.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration (sensitive database information leakage).
    *   Data modification.
    *   Potential disruption of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the `/dg-user/?controller=emailing&action=add` endpoint.
    *   The attacker injects malicious SQL code through the `emailing_add_nom` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with "administrator privilege" or "a user with permission to manage emailing". This means the attacker needs to have legitimate access to the administrative panel.
    *   The attacker also needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters to craft the injection.

**Technical Details:**

*   The code directly takes the `emailing_add_nom` parameter from the POST request and injects it into the SQL INSERT query without any sanitization.
*   The provided exploit shows how to use the injection to retrieve the database version by injecting:

`emailing_add_nom`,`email`,`description`,`date_creation`)/**/VALUES(7,(select@@version),'test@localhost.com','aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa','1554791193');#`

This injects a subquery `(select@@version)` into the SQL statement, which then gets executed by the database, exposing the version information.

**Additional Notes**
* The document provides a detailed walkthrough of how to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability and the full SQL statement that will be executed.
* The document also provides screenshots to show the request parameters, the executed SQL statements and the results of the exploit.
