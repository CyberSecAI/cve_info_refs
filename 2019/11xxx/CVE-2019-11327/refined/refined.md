The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11327.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the "File Explorer" feature of the Topcon Net-G5 GNSS Receiver's web interface. The application trusts user-supplied input without sanitizing it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Path Traversal: The application fails to prevent directory traversal attacks via the `directory` and `filename` parameters in the `/ftp` endpoint. This allows an attacker to navigate to parent directories and access arbitrary files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can browse the entire file system of the device with the rights of the root user and download any file on the device and attached external media. This includes sensitive configuration files, system files, and potentially user data.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is accessible through the web interface of the device. By crafting specific HTTP requests to the `/ftp` endpoint, an attacker can exploit the path traversal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have network access to the device and have administrator privileges on the device's web interface, which can be obtained by exploiting CVE-2019-11326 first.
Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the web server.
