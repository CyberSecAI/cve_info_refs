### Finding: Relevant
The provided content discusses a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Materialize CSS framework related to how it handles dynamic content in Toasts, Tooltips, and Autocomplete components.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The library by default injects input data as HTML into components like Toasts, Tooltips, and Autocomplete without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XSS vulnerability due to the use of `jquery.html('untrustData')` or `innerHTML = 'untrustData'` instead of sanitizing the data or using `jquery.text('untrustData')`.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code, leading to reflected XSS. This can result in the execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or defacing the website.
*   **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript code into input fields that are used by Toasts, Tooltips, or Autocomplete.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to find a way to inject unsanitized data into the application, which then gets passed to the vulnerable components. The attacker could achieve this by manipulating input fields or exploiting server-side vulnerabilities that allow for the injection of malicious data.
