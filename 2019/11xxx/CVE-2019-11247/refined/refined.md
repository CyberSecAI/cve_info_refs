{
  "CVE-2019-11247": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Description": "The Kubernetes API server mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced.  Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges).",
      "Severity": "Important"
    },
    "Root cause": "The Kubernetes API server incorrectly enforces access control for cluster-scoped custom resources when requests are made as if they were namespaced.",
     "Weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect authorization checks",
        "Mishandling of resource scoping",
        "Insufficient validation of API requests"
      ],
    "Impact": "A user with access to a resource within a namespace can improperly gain access to cluster-scoped resources, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.",
    "Attack vector": "Network-based exploitation via API requests.",
    "Required capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated to the Kubernetes API and have access to at least one resource in a namespace.  The attacker must also craft a specific request that appears to be for a namespaced resource but targets a cluster-scoped resource."
