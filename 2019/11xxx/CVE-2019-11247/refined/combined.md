# Google Terms of Service

Effective May 22, 2024 | [Archived versions](terms/archive?hl=en_US) | [Download PDF](https://www.gstatic.com/policies/terms/pdf/20240522/ks8shls0/google_terms_of_service_en_eu.pdf)

[Country version:](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-country-version) Ireland

## What’s covered in these terms

### We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), and what we expect from you.

These Terms of Service reflect [the way Google’s business works](https://about.google/intl/en_IE/how-our-business-works), the laws that apply to our company, and [certain things we’ve always believed to be true](https://www.google.com/about/philosophy.html?hl=en_US). As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

* [What you can expect from us](terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-you-expect), which describes how we provide and develop our services
* [What we expect from you](terms?hl=en_US#toc-what-we-expect), which establishes certain rules for using our services
* [Content in Google services](terms?hl=en_US#toc-content), which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
* [In case of problems or disagreements](terms?hl=en_US#toc-problems), which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms

Understanding these terms is important because, to use our services, you must accept these terms. We encourage you to download these terms for future reference. We make these terms, and all previous versions, available at all times [here](terms/archive?hl=en_US).

Besides these terms, we also publish a [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US). Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can [update, manage, export, and delete your information](https://myaccount.google.com/?hl=en_US).

# Terms

## Service provider

In the European Economic Area (EEA) and Switzerland, Google [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

Google Ireland Limited
incorporated and operating under the laws of Ireland
(Registration Number: 368047 / VAT Number: IE6388047V)

Gordon House, Barrow Street
Dublin 4
Ireland

## Age requirements

If you’re under the [age required to manage your own Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US), you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services), then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

# Your relationship with Google

These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google Ireland Limited and its [affiliates](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-affiliates). Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect [how Google’s business works and how we earn money](https://about.google/intl/en_IE/how-our-business-works).

## What you can expect from us

### Provide a broad range of useful services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/provide_services_illustration.svg)We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:

* apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
* platforms (like Google Shopping)
* integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
* devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)

Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

### Develop, improve, and update Google services

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/improve_services_illustration.svg)

While we use a broad definition of “services” throughout these terms as described above, applicable law draws distinctions between “digital content”, “services”, and “goods” in certain situations. That’s why we use the more specific terms in this section and the [Legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#toc-legal-guarantee) section.

We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware.

As part of the continual evolution of our digital content, services, and goods, we make modifications such as adding or removing features and functionalities, increasing or decreasing usage limits, and offering new digital content or services or discontinuing old ones. We may also change our digital content or services for these other reasons:

* to adapt to new technologies
* to reflect increases or decreases in the number of people who use a particular service
* to respond to key changes in the licenses and partnerships we have with others
* to prevent abuse or harm
* to address legal, regulatory, safety, or security issues

In particular, we sometimes make legally-required updates, which are modifications that keep digital content, services, or goods in conformity with the law. We make these updates to our digital content, services, and goods for safety or security reasons, and to make sure they meet the quality standards that you expect, such as those described in the [Legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#toc-legal-guarantee) section. We may automatically install updates that address significant safety or security risks. For other updates, you can choose whether you want them installed.

We maintain a rigorous product research program, so before we change or stop offering a service, we carefully consider your interests as a user, your reasonable expectations, and the potential impact on you and others. We only change or stop offering services for valid reasons.

If a modification negatively affects your ability to access or use our digital content or services, or if we stop offering a service all together, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice by email — including a description of the changes, when they’ll take place, and your right to end your contract with us if our modifications create more than a minor negative impact — except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse or harm, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) from your Google Account using [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law and policies.

## What we expect from you

### Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/ssat_illustration.svg)The permission we give you to access and use our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) continues as long as you comply with:

* **these terms**
* **[service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)**, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements

We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US), [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US), [Safety Center](https://safety.google?hl=en_US), [Transparency Center](https://transparency.google/?hl=en_US), and other pages accessible from our [policies site](/?hl=en_US). Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) we have in the services.

### Respect others

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/respect_others_illustration.svg)We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:

* comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
* respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
* don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others

Our [service-specific additional terms and policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), such as our [Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy](terms/generative-ai/use-policy?hl=en_US), provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to [report abuse](https://support.google.com/groups/answer/81275?hl=en_US). If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the *[Taking action in case of problems](terms?hl=en_US#taking-action)* section.

### Don’t abuse our services

Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:

* introducing malware
* spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
* jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our [safety and bug testing programs](https://bughunters.google.com/?hl=en_US)
* accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:

+ phishing
+ creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
+ misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
+ providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us

* providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
* using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
* reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
* using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
* using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
* hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
* providing services that encourage others to violate these terms

### Permission to use your content

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/permission_to_use_illustration.svg)

Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive, or share [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content). You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.

## License

[Your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) remains yours, which means that you retain any [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights) that you have in your content. For example, you have intellectual property rights in the creative content you make, such as reviews you write. Or you may have the right to share someone else’s creative content if they’ve given you their permission.

We need your permission if your intellectual property rights restrict our use of your content. You provide Google with that permission through this license.

### What’s covered

This license covers [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) if that content is protected by intellectual property rights.

### What’s not covered

* This license doesn’t affect your data protection rights — it’s only about your intellectual property rights
* This license doesn’t cover these types of content:
  + publicly-available factual information that you provide, such as corrections to the address of a local business. That information doesn’t require a license because it’s considered common knowledge that everyone’s free to use.
  + feedback that you offer, such as suggestions to improve our services. Feedback is covered in the *[Service-related communications](terms?hl=en_US#toc-service-related-comm)* section below.

### Scope

This license is:

* worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
* non-exclusive, which means you can license your content to others
* royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
### Rights

This license allows Google to:

* host, reproduce, distribute, communicate, and use your content — for example, to save your content on our systems and make it accessible from anywhere you go
* publish, publicly perform, or publicly display your content, if you’ve made it visible to others
* modify your content, such as reformatting or translating it
* sublicense these rights to:
  + other users to allow the services to work as designed, such as enabling you to share photos with people you choose
  + our contractors who’ve signed agreements with us that are consistent with these terms, only for the limited purposes described in the *[Purpose](terms?hl=en_US#toc-purpose)* section below

### Purpose

This license is for the limited purpose of:

* **operating and improving the services**, which means allowing the services to work as designed and creating new features and functionalities. This includes using automated systems and algorithms to analyze your content:
  + for spam, malware, and illegal content
  + to recognize patterns in data, such as determining when to suggest a new album in Google Photos to keep related photos together
  + to customize our services for you, such as providing recommendations and personalized search results, content, and ads (which you can change or turn off in [Ads Settings](https://adssettings.google.com?ref=ps-terms&hl=en_US))This analysis occurs as the content is sent, received, and when it is stored.
* **using content you’ve shared publicly to promote the services**. For example, to promote a Google app, we might quote a review you wrote. Or to promote Google Play, we might show a screenshot of the app you offer in the Play Store.
* **developing new technologies and services** for Google consistent with these terms

### Duration

This license lasts for as long as your content is protected by intellectual property rights.

If you remove from our services any content that’s covered by this license, then our systems will stop making that content publicly available in a reasonable amount of time. There are two exceptions:

* If you already shared your content with others before removing it. For example, if you shared a photo with a friend who then made a copy of it, or shared it again, then that photo may continue to appear in your friend’s Google Account even after you remove it from your Google Account.
* If you make your content available through other companies’ services, it’s possible that search engines, including Google Search, will continue to find and display your content as part of their search results.

# Using Google services

## Your Google Account

[If you meet these age requirements](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1350409?hl=en_US) you can [create a Google Account](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27441?hl=en_US) for your convenience. Some [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) require that you have a Google Account in order to work — for example, to use Gmail, you need a Google Account so that you have a place to send and receive your email.

You’re responsible for what you do with your Google Account, including taking reasonable steps to keep your Google Account secure, and we encourage you to regularly use the [Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup?hl=en_US).

## Using Google services on behalf of an organization or business

Many [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), such as businesses, non-profits, and schools, take advantage of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). To use our services on behalf of an organization:

* an authorized representative of that organization must agree to these terms
* your organization’s administrator may assign a Google Account to you. That administrator might require you to follow additional rules and may be able to access or disable your Google Account.
If you’re based in the European Union, then these terms don’t affect the rights you may have as a [business user](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) of online intermediation services — including online platforms such as Google Play — under the [EU Platform-to-Business Regulation](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-eu-platform-to-business).
## Service-related communications

To provide you with our services, we sometimes send you service announcements and other information. To learn more about how we communicate with you, see Google’s [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US).

If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.

![](https://www.gstatic.com/identity/boq/policies/privacy/content_in_services_illustration.svg)
# Content in Google services

## Your content

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) allow you to generate original content. Google won’t claim ownership over that content.

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you the opportunity to make your content publicly available — for example, you might post a product or restaurant review that you wrote, or you might upload a blog post that you created.

* See the *[Permission to use your content](terms?hl=en_US#toc-permission)* section for more about your rights in [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content), and how your content is used in our services
* See the *[Removing your content](terms?hl=en_US#toc-removing)* section to learn why and how we might remove user-generated content from our services

If you think someone is infringing your [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights), you can [send us notice of the infringement](https://support.google.com/legal/answer/3110420?hl=en_US) and we’ll take appropriate action. For example, we suspend or close the Google Accounts of repeat [copyright](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-copyright) infringers as described in our [Copyright Help Center](https://support.google.com/legal/topic/4558877?hl=en_US).

## Google content

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include content that belongs to Google — for example, many of the visual illustrations you see in Google Maps. You may use Google’s content as allowed by these terms and any [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), but we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in our content. Don’t remove, obscure, or alter any of our branding, logos, or legal notices. If you want to use our branding or logos, please see the [Google Brand Permissions](https://www.google.com/permissions?hl=en_US) page.

## Other content

Finally, some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) give you access to content that belongs to other people or [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) — for example, a store owner’s description of their own business, or a newspaper article displayed in Google News. You may not use this content without that person or organization’s permission, or as otherwise allowed by law. The views expressed in other people or organizations’ content are theirs, and don’t necessarily reflect Google’s views.

# Software in Google services

Some of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) include downloadable or preloaded software. We give you permission to use that software as part of the services.

The license we give you is:

* worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world
* non-exclusive, which means that we can license the software to others
* royalty-free, which means there are no monetary fees for this license
* personal, which means it doesn’t extend to anyone else
* non-assignable, which means you’re not allowed to assign the license to anyone else

Some of our services include software that’s offered under open source license terms that we make available to you. Sometimes there are provisions in the open source license that explicitly override parts of these terms, so please be sure to read those licenses.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our services or software.

# In case of problems or disagreements

Both the law and these terms give you the right to (1) a certain quality of service, and (2) ways to fix problems if things go wrong. If you’re a [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), then you enjoy all legal rights granted to consumers under applicable law, as well as any additional rights provided under these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US).

## Legal guarantee

If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), and you’ve agreed to our Terms of Service, then EEA consumer laws provide you with a [legal guarantee](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-legal-guarantee) covering the digital content, services, or goods that we provide you. Under this guarantee, we’re [liable](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) for any [lack of conformity](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-lack-conformity) that you discover:

* within two years of the delivery of goods (such as a phone) or the one-time supply of digital content or services (such as purchasing a movie)
* at any time during the “continuous” supply of digital content or services (such as Maps or Gmail)

Your national laws may provide an even longer guarantee. Your rights under these legal guarantees aren’t limited by any other [commercial guarantees](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-commercial-guarantee) that we provide. If you want to make a guarantee claim, please [contact us](https://about.google/contact-google/?hl=en_US).

## Liabilities

### For all users

These terms don’t limit [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) for:

* fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation
* death or personal injury caused by negligence
* gross negligence
* willful misconduct

Other than the liabilities described above, Google is liable only for its breaches of these terms or applicable [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), subject to applicable law.

### For business users and organizations only

If you’re a [business user](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-business-user) or [organization](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization):

* To the extent allowed by applicable law, you’ll [indemnify](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify) Google and its directors, officers, employees, and contractors for any third-party legal proceedings (including actions by government authorities) arising out of or relating to your unlawful use of the [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services) or violation of these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US). This indemnity covers any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, judgments, fines, litigation costs, and legal fees, except to the extent a liability or expense is caused by Google's breach, negligence, or willful misconduct.
* If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including [indemnification](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-indemnify), then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under these terms. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from legal obligations and these terms don’t override those immunities.
* Google won’t be responsible for the following [liabilities](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability):
  + loss of profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill, or anticipated savings
  + indirect or consequential loss
  + punitive damages
* Except as stated in the *[For all users](terms?hl=en_US#for-all)* section above, Google’s total liability arising out of or relating to these terms is limited to the greater of (1) €500 or (2) 125% of the fees that you paid to use the relevant services in the 12 months before the breach.

## Taking action in case of problems

Before taking action as described below, we’ll provide you with advance notice when reasonably possible, describe the reason for our action, and give you an opportunity to clarify the issue and address it, unless we reasonably believe that doing so would:

* cause harm or [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google
* violate the law or a legal enforcement authority’s order
* compromise an investigation
* compromise the operation, integrity, or security of our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services)

### Removing your content

If we reasonably believe that any of [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) (1) breaches these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), (2) violates applicable law, or (3) could harm our users, third parties, or Google, then we reserve the right to take down some or all of that content in accordance with applicable law. Examples include child pornography, content that facilitates human trafficking or harassment, terrorist content, and content that infringes someone else’s [intellectual property rights](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-intellectual-property-rights).

### Suspending or terminating your access to Google services

Without limiting any of our other rights, Google may suspend or terminate your access to the services or delete your Google Account if any of these things happen:

* you materially or repeatedly breach these terms, [service-specific additional terms or policies](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US)
* we’re required to do so to comply with a legal requirement or a court order
* we reasonably believe that your conduct causes harm or [liability](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-liability) to a user, third party, or Google — for example, by hacking, phishing, harassing, spamming, misleading others, or scraping content that doesn’t belong to you

For more information about why we disable accounts and what happens when we do, see this [Help Center page](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US). If you believe your Google Account has been suspended or terminated in error, [you can appeal](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/40695?hl=en_US).

Of course, you’re always free to stop using our services at any time. If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), you can also [withdraw from these terms](terms?hl=en_US#toc-withdrawal-form) within 14 days of accepting them. If you do stop using a service, we’d [appreciate knowing why](https://www.google.com/tools/feedback/intl/en/?hl=en_US) so that we can continue improving our services.

## Handling requests for your data

Respect for the privacy and security of your data underpins our approach to responding to data disclosure requests. When we receive data disclosure requests, our team reviews them to make sure they satisfy legal requirements and Google’s [data disclosure policies](terms/information-requests?hl=en_US). Google Ireland Limited accesses and discloses data, including communications, in accordance with the laws of Ireland, and EU law applicable in Ireland. For more information about the data disclosure requests that Google receives worldwide, and how we respond to such requests, see our [Transparency Report](https://transparencyreport.google.com?hl=en_US) and [Privacy Policy](privacy?hl=en_US).

## Settling disputes, governing law, and courts

For information about how to contact Google, please visit our [contact page](https://www.google.com/contact?hl=en_US).

If you’re a resident of, or an [organization](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization) based in, the European Economic Area (EEA) or Switzerland, these terms and your relationship with Google under these terms and [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), are governed by the laws of your country of residence, and you can file legal disputes in your local courts. If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), please [contact us](https://google.com/contact?hl=en_US) to resolve issues directly. The European Commission also offers an [Online Dispute Resolution platform](https://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr), but Google isn’t legally required to use this or other alternative dispute resolution platforms.

# About these terms

By law, you have certain rights that can’t be limited by a contract like these terms of service. These terms are in no way intended to restrict those rights.

These terms describe the relationship between you and Google. They don’t create any legal rights for other people or [organizations](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-organization), even if others benefit from that relationship under these terms.

We want to make these terms easy to understand, so we’ve used examples from our [services](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-services). But not all services mentioned may be available in your country.

If it turns out that a particular term is not valid or enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.

If you don’t follow these terms or the [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), and we don’t take action right away, that doesn’t mean we’re giving up any rights that we may have, such as taking action in the future.

We may update these terms and [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US) (1) to reflect changes in our services or how we do business — for example, when we add new services, features, technologies, pricing, or benefits (or remove old ones), (2) for legal, regulatory, or security reasons, or (3) to prevent abuse or harm.

If we materially change these terms or [service-specific additional terms](terms/service-specific?hl=en_US), we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except (1) when we launch a new service or feature, or (2) in urgent situations, such as preventing ongoing abuse or responding to legal requirements. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should remove [your content](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-your-content) and stop using the services. You can also end your relationship with us at any time by closing your Google Account.

# EEA instructions on withdrawal

If you’re an EEA-based [consumer](terms?hl=en_US#footnote-consumer), then EEA consumer law gives you the right to withdraw from this contract as described in the *EU’s Model Instructions on Withdrawal*, provided below.

### Right of withdrawal

You have the right to withdraw from this contract within 14 days without giving any reason.

The withdrawal period will expire after 14 days from the day of the conclusion of the contract.

To exercise the right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision to withdraw from this contract by an unequivocal statement (e.g. a letter sent by post or e-mail). You can contact us by email at account-withdrawal@google.com; by phone +353 1 533 9837 (see below for [country-specific telephone numbers](terms?hl=en_US#country-phone-numbers)); or by writing to us at Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. You may use the attached model withdrawal form, but it is not obligatory. You can also electronically fill in and submit the model withdrawal form or any other unequivocal statement on our website ([g.co/EEAWithdrawalForm](https://g.co/EEAWithdrawalForm)). If you use this option, we will communicate to you an acknowledgement of receipt of such a withdrawal on a durable medium (e.g. by e-mail) without delay.

To meet the withdrawal deadline, it is sufficient for you to send your communication concerning your exercise of the right of withdrawal before the withdrawal period has expired.

### Effects of withdrawal

If you withdraw from this contract, we shall reimburse to you all payments received from you, including the costs of delivery (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us), without undue delay and in any event not later than 14 days from the day on which we are informed about your decision to withdraw from this contract. We will carry out such reimbursement using the same means of payment as you used for the initial transaction, unless you have expressly agreed otherwise; in any event, you will not incur any fees as a result of such reimbursement.

### Model withdrawal form

(complete and return this form only if you wish to withdraw from the contract)

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c0)  Sam Fowler    2019-07-23 01:55:11 UTC  ``` The Kubernetes API server mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced.  Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges).   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c1)  Sam Fowler    2019-07-23 01:56:32 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: the Kubernetes Product Security Committee   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c4)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-05 23:39:47 UTC  ``` Upstream Issue:  <https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/80983>   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c5)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-05 23:41:45 UTC  ``` External References:  <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kubernetes-security-discuss/Vf31dXp0EJc>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c6)  Sam Fowler    2019-08-05 23:44:02 UTC  ``` Created kubernetes tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1737646](show_bug.cgi?id=1737646 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2019-11247 kubernetes: API server allows access to cluster-scoped custom resources as if resources were namespaced [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c13)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-08-15 13:27:31 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.1  Via RHSA-2019:2504 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2504](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019%3A2504)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1732192#c14)  Product Security DevOps Team    2019-08-15 14:47:10 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

# Security Data

Red Hat Product Security is committed to providing tools and security data to help security measurement. A part of this commitment is our active participation in various projects such as the CVE Project, the OASIS CSAF technical committee, or SBOM/VEX forums. We provide the raw data below so customers and researchers can produce their own metrics, for their own unique situations, and hold us accountable. To receive notifications when we fix bugs and add new features, please follow the official [Red Hat Security Data Changelog](https://access.redhat.com/articles/5554431).

The data resources linked on this page as well as their alternative representations available through the [Security Data API](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_security_data_api/1.0/html/red_hat_security_data_api/index) are licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). If you distribute this content or a modified version of it, you must provide attribution to Red Hat, Inc. and provide a link to the original.

**Note:** Security data (CSAF, OVAL, SBOM, and other files) published by Red Hat Product Security was previously served from two locations:

* https://access.redhat.com/security/data/\*
* https://www.redhat.com/security/data/\*

A new domain was recently created the scope of which (for the time being) is to serve this same data:

* https://security.access.redhat.com/data/\*

Effective Sep 3, 2024, a redirect was put in place for all traffic from *www.redhat.com/security/data/\** to be redirected to the new *security.access.redhat.com/data/\** domain. On Sep 30, a similar change was made for *access.redhat.com/security/data/\** to redirect to *security.access.redhat.com/data/*. No change to the actual files or directory layout under the *data/\** path was made. You can start consuming from the new domain today. For example: <https://access.redhat.com/security/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json> is now available at <https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/2024/cve-2024-0151.json>; on Sep 30, the former began redirecting to the latter.

### CSAF/VEX Documents

The Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) standard enables organizations to share information about security issues using a consistent and common format. We provide Red Hat security advisories in CSAF format using the VEX profile as well as per-CVE VEX documents that contains information on both fixed and unfixed products/components.

* [CSAF GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/csaf-vex-documents-now-generally-available)
  + [Link to CSAF advisories](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/advisories/)
* [VEX files for CVEs GA announcement post](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-vex-files-cves-are-now-generally-available%20)
  + [Link to CSAF VEX per-CVE files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/csaf/v2/vex/)

### OSV Records

[Red Hat / OSV.dev announcement on OpenSSF](https://openssf.org/blog/2024/11/01/red-hats-collaboration-with-the-openssf-and-osv-dev-yields-results-red-hat-security-data-now-available-in-the-osv-format/%20). The CSAF advisory data for RPMs is convertered to OSV records and shared with OSV.dev. It is expected that customers will consume this data from OSV.dev not directly from this URL. This is the location OSV.dev consumes the data from.

* [Link to Red Hat OSV data](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/osv/all.json)

### SBOM Documents

Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a complete list of components, their versions, licensing information, provenance, and other metadata for a given product. Red Hat publishes SBOM documents for select products at:

* [Link to SBOM documents](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/sbom/beta/spdx/)

### OVAL Definitions

**Note: OVAL/DS v1 files are no longer available and have been archived; see [OVAL v1 deprecation announcement](https://access.redhat.com/OVAL_v1_deprecation_announcement) for more information.**

OVAL definitions are available for vulnerabilities that were addressed in errata for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and select additional products. To completely evaluate your system you will need to evaluate it against the streams for all products installed on that system.

* [OVAL compatibility FAQ](https://access.redhat.com/articles/221883)
* [OVAL Streams directory](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/oval/v2/)
* [SCAP source data stream files](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/metrics/ds/v2/)

### Vulnerability Metadata

#### Repository to CPE Mapping

Used for matching [OVAL security data to installed RPMs](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/how-accurately-match-oval-security-data-installed-rpms). Each repository also includes a set of relative URLs from where the content of the repository can be downloaded.

* [repository-to-cpe.json](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/repository-to-cpe.json)

#### RHSA RSS feed

An RSS feed that contains a list of Red Hat security advisories released in the last three days.

* [rhsa.rss](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/rhsa.rss)

#### CPE Dictionary

CPE is a structured naming scheme for information technology systems, software, and packages. For reference, we provide a dictionary mapping the CPE names we use, to Red Hat product descriptions. Some of these CPE names will be for new products that are not in the official CPE dictionary, and should therefore be treated as temporary CPE names:

* [cpe-dictionary.xml](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/meta/v1/cpe-dictionary.xml)

### Security Data Archive

Security data files that have been retired are available in an archive. Each file is marked with a date (YYYYMMDD) when it was last updated:

* [Link to Security Data archive](https://security.access.redhat.com/data/archive/)

Hello Kubernetes Community,

We have released Kubernetes [1.13.9](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.13.md#v1139), [1.14.5](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.14.md#v1145), and [1.15.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG-1.15.md#v1152) to address two security issues in Kubernetes. We recommend all clusters and kubectl clients update to one of these releases immediately.

CVE-2019-11247: API server allows access to custom resources via wrong scope

This vulnerability allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced. Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges).

See Kubernetes issue [#80983](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/80983) for details. Thanks to Prabu Shyam of Verizon Media for reporting this problem.

CVE-2019-11249: Incomplete fixes for CVE-2019-1002101 and CVE-2019-11246, kubectl cp potential directory traversal

This vulnerability allows a malicious container to cause a file to be created or replaced on the client computer when the client uses the kubectl cp operation. The vulnerability is a client-side defect and requires user interaction to be exploited.

See Kubernetes issue [#80984](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/80984) for details. Thanks to Yang Yang of Amazon for reporting this problem.

As a reminder, if you find a security vulnerability in Kubernetes, please report it following the [security disclosure process](https://kubernetes.io/security/).

Thanks,

Joel Smith

(on behalf of the Kubernetes Product Security Team)

This issue did not affect the versions of grafana(embeds golang) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 as they did not include the support for HTTP/2. The following storage product versions are affected because they include the support for HTTP/2 in: * golang as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 * heketi(embeds golang) as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 * grafana(embeds golang and grpc) as shipped with Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 This flaw has no available mitigation for packages golang and nodejs. Both packages will be updated once the available fixes are released for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections.  The nodejs RPM shipped in OpenShift Container Platform 3.9 and 3.10 is not affected by this flaw as it does not contain the vulnerable code.  All OpenShift Container Platform RPMs and container images that are built with Go and support HTTP/2 are vulnerable to this flaw.   ```  [Comment 102](show_bug.cgi?id=1735645#c102)  errata-xmlrpc

[View affected systems](https://console.redhat.com/insights/patch/advisories/RHBA-2019%3A2816)

## Topic

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform release 3.11.146 is now available with
updates to packages and images that fix several bugs.

## Description

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform is Red Hat's cloud computing
Kubernetes application platform solution designed for on-premise or private
cloud deployments.

This advisory contains the RPM packages for Red Hat OpenShift Container
Platform 3.11.146. See the following advisory for the container images for
this release:

[https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019:2824](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2019%3A2824)

This update fixes the following bugs:

* kuryr-controller could not access the OpenShift API LoadBalancer members with OVN if kuryr-controller was running on master nodes. Now, kuryr-controller is forced to be on infrastructure nodes. As a result, kuryr-controller can now access the OpenShift API LoadBalancers. (BZ#1641647)
* In rare cases, the cluster console would not display a projects list when the user logged in. This was due to a race condition that would cause the project list to fail after logging into the admin console. The user would need to refresh the page to see the list of projects. This race condition has been addressed, and projects now load successfully after logging in. (BZ#1703777)
* Image tags were not provided for some ose-pod image pulls. As a result, multiple image versions could be pulled from the ose-pod image. Now, image tags have been added to the registry\_auth and only a single image version for ose-pod is pulled. (BZ#1725938)
* Clusters with large numbers of unidled services could see extended wait times applying endpoint changes to cluster IP addresses. Iptables access is now better coordinated and synchronization of firewall rules occurs in less time. (BZ#1734009)
* Egress IP addresses did not operate correctly in namespaces with restrictive NetworkPolicies. Pods that accepted traffic only from specific sources would not be able to send egress traffic via egress IP addresses because the response from the external server would be mistakenly rejected by their NetworkPolicies. Now, replies from egress traffic are correctly recognized as replies rather than as new connections. (BZ#1741477)
* Metrics-server-certs did not remove secrets if the server was uninstalled. The metrics serving cert label has been corrected and metrics serving certs are removed completely. (BZ#1746212)
* Outgoing connections would sometimes be dropped if a minimum kernel version was not installed. A check has been added to ensure that the installed kernel meets the required minimum version to avoid network issues. This check is run during prerequisites, scale-up, and upgrade. (BZ#1749024)
* Upgrade playbooks were not respecting the openshift\_docker\_additional\_registries variable. The registries.conf has been updated to observe inventory variables that have been set or changes since the last upgrade. (BZ#1749341)

All OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 users are advised to upgrade to these
updated packages and images.

## Solution

Before applying this update, ensure all previously released errata
relevant to your system have been applied.

For OpenShift Container Platform 3.11 see the following documentation,
which will be updated shortly for release 3.11.146, for important
instructions on how to upgrade your cluster and fully apply this
asynchronous errata update:

<https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/release_notes/ocp_3_11_release_notes.html>

This update is available via the Red Hat Network. Details on how to use the
Red Hat Network to apply this update are available at
<https://access.redhat.com/articles/11258.>

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c0)  Jeff Cantrill    2019-09-17 12:16:29 UTC  ``` This bug was initially created as a copy of [Bug #1746377](show_bug.cgi?id=1746377 "CLOSED ERRATA - There should be more index pattern in kibana")  I am copying this bug because:     Description of problem: The user 'anli1' own two projects 'logjson1' and 'loggen1'. But the user only show index project.loggen1.**** in kibana. (See the snapshot)   Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable): openshift3/ose-logging-kibana5:v3.11.141 openshift3/oauth-proxy:v3.11.141  How reproducible: Always  1. Deploy logging  openshift_logging_install_eventrouter=true openshift_logging_es_allow_external=True openshift_logging_elasticsearch_storage_type=pvc openshift_logging_es_pvc_storage_class_name=bogus-glusterfs openshift_logging_es_pvc_dynamic=true openshift_logging_es_number_of_shards=1 openshift_logging_es_number_of_replicas=1 openshift_logging_es_memory_limit=2Gi openshift_logging_es_cluster_size=2 openshift_logging_es_nodeselector={"role":"node"} openshift_logging_namespace=openshift-logging openshift_logging_install_logging=true  2. user 'anli1' create two projects oc new-project loggen1 oc new-app <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/logging/loggen/container_log_template.json> oc new-project logjson1 oc new-app <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-qe/v3-testfiles/master/logging/loggen/container_log_template.json>  3. $ oc get projects NAME       DISPLAY NAME   STATUS loggen1                   Active logjson1                  Active  4. check the indices and alias + oc exec -c elasticsearch logging-es-data-master-67u8p4ld-1-k95hm -- es_util '--query=_aliases?pretty'  5. View indices on kibana using 'anli1'.   See the snapshot   Actual results: The user 'anli1' can only view project.loggen1.******  Expected results:  The user 'anli1' can view patten '.all', 'project.loggen1.*****' and 'project.logjson1.****'   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c6)  Jeff Cantrill    2019-09-19 20:37:10 UTC  ``` Workarounds:  * User's should be able to manually create the index patterns using the management tab or retrieve logs directly from Elastic by exposing it as a route and submitting the appropriate query.   * 'oc logs' available to them though this will be limited to whats available on the node. * It MAY be possible to downgrade to 3.11.98 but this does not include the caching fix which introduced the current issue and is subject to its own issues.  I would avoid downgrading if possible.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c7)  Anping Li    2019-09-20 03:04:57 UTC  ``` I can see the pattern on the kibana, but we couldn't assign any of them to be the default pattern.  openshift3/ose-logging-elasticsearch5:v3.11.146 openshift3/oauth-proxy:v3.11.146 openshift3/ose-logging-kibana5:v3.11.146   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c8)  Anping Li    2019-09-20 03:07:00 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1616989](attachment.cgi?id=1616989 "No default Pattern for cluster-admin") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1616989&action=edit "No default Pattern for cluster-admin") No default Pattern for cluster-admin  No default Pattern for cluster-admin,  the cluster-admin can set default pattern.   ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c9)  Anping Li    2019-09-20 03:09:27 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1616990](attachment.cgi?id=1616990 "Snapshot for no-cluster-admin users") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1616990&action=edit "Snapshot for no-cluster-admin users") Snapshot for no-cluster-admin users  No default pattern and user is unable to set default pattern.   ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c10)  Anping Li    2019-09-20 03:13:59 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 1617004](attachment.cgi?id=1617004 "The kibana and ES logs") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1617004&action=edit "The kibana and ES logs") The kibana and ES logs   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c12)  Jeff Cantrill    2019-09-20 13:50:30 UTC  ``` (In reply to Anping Li from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c9)) > Created [attachment 1616990](attachment.cgi?id=1616990 "Snapshot for no-cluster-admin users") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=1616990&action=edit "Snapshot for no-cluster-admin users") > Snapshot for no-cluster-admin users >  > No default pattern and user is unable to set default pattern.  I am unable to reproduce.  Using brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/openshift3/ose-logging-elasticsearch5:v3.11.146-2   I have a user that is only able to see:    * myproject     test-a     test-b  Using an 'incognito' browser to Kibana to ensure no caching:  I see index patterns:  Default: project.test-b.404a9f7c-d59a...          project.test-a.42a7b97d-d59a....  Set project.test-a as the default.  No errors Log out. Log back in.  Go to discover tab.  Note project.test-a.42a7b97d-d59a... is now the default   ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c13)  Jeff Cantrill    2019-09-20 13:53:19 UTC  ``` Looking at the snapshot for noncluster admin.  It also looks like you are missing versions of Kibana and Elastic as noticed by the error.  It appears you are using an earlier image that has an earlier version of Kibana (5.6.13) then the what the server expects (5.6.16)   ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c14)  Jeff Cantrill    2019-09-20 14:16:22 UTC  ``` Reran test confirming I have the following images:  brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/openshift3/ose-logging-kibana5          v3.11.146-4           67e3c2bd0a4f        19 hours ago        1.08 GB brew-pulp-docker01.web.prod.ext.phx2.redhat.com:8888/openshift3/ose-logging-elasticsearch5   v3.11.146-2           9c3dc9e56e6d        42 hours ago        545 MB  Same result as #c12   ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c16)  Anping Li    2019-09-23 05:48:56 UTC  ``` The kibana works well in openshift3/ose-logging-kibana5/images/v3.11.146-6   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1752853#c18)  errata-xmlrpc    2019-09-24 08:08:09 UTC  ``` Since the problem described in this bug report should be resolved in a recent advisory, it has been closed with a resolution of ERRATA.

# Severity ratings

## Understanding Red Hat security ratings

Red Hat Product Security rates the severity of security issues found
in Red Hat products using a four-point scale (Low, Moderate,
Important, and Critical), as well as including a separate Common
Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base score. These scoring systems
provide a prioritized risk assessment to help you understand and
schedule upgrades to your systems, enabling informed decisions on the
risk each issue places on your unique environment.

The four-point scale tells you how serious Red Hat considers an issue
to be, helping you judge the severity and determine the most important
updates. The scale takes into account the potential risk based on a technical analysis of the exact flaw and its type. The risk level of a flaw does not change if an exploit or worm is later released for a flaw, or if one is available before the release of a fix. A flaw will only be re-evaluated if new technical details emerge.

The following table provides severity ratings for Red Hat products and systems. For flaws specific to AI models, see [Red Hat security ratings for AI models](https://access.redhat.com/security/ai).

| **Severity ratings** | **Security flaw description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Critical impact** | This rating is given to flaws that could be easily exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker and lead to system compromise (arbitrary code execution) without requiring user interaction, or easily cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. Flaws that require authentication, local or physical access to a system, or an unlikely configuration are not classified as Critical impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that can be exploited by worms. |
| **Important impact** | This rating is given to flaws that can easily compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources. These are the types of vulnerabilities that allow local or authenticated users to gain additional privileges, allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by authentication or other controls, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, allow remote users to cause a denial of service, or can cause system compromise via inference end points on AI systems. |
| **Moderate impact** | This rating is given to flaws that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of resources under certain circumstances. It is also given to flaws that could be exploited to cause denial of service-like conditions on AI systems via an inference end point, or allow attackers to steal other users’ data from the AI system without authorization. These are the types of vulnerabilities that could have had a Critical or Important impact but are less easily exploited based on a technical evaluation of the flaw and/or affect unlikely configurations. || **Low impact** | This rating is given to all other issues that may have a security impact. These are the types of vulnerabilities that are believed to require unlikely circumstances to be able to be exploited, or where a successful exploit would give minimal consequences. This includes flaws that are present in a program’s source code but to which no current or theoretically possible, but unproven, exploitation vectors exist or were found during the technical analysis of the flaw. |

A Red Hat security advisory can contain fixes for more than one
vulnerability and for packages for more than one product (such as both
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and 8). Each issue in an advisory has a
severity rating for each product. The overall severity of an advisory
is the highest severity out of all the individual issues, across all
the products the advisory targets. For simplicity, advisories only
show the overall severity. The advisories contain links to the
relevant entries in Red Hat's bug-tracking system, where you can
examine individual severity ratings and additional commentary, as well
as links to the relevant pages in Red Hat’s CVE database.

When a technology—enabled and most likely used by default—completely
blocks the exploitation of a particular vulnerability across all
architectures, we will adjust the severity level. When a technology
reduces the risk of a vulnerability, we may adjust the severity level
and give an explanation of the decision in the bug-tracking  and CVE
database entries.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) base scores provide
additional guidance about a vulnerability, giving a detailed severity
rating by scoring the constant aspects of a vulnerability: Attack
Vector, Attack Complexity, User Interaction, Privileges Required,
Scope, Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

CVSS version 2 base metrics are available for all vulnerabilities from
2009-2016, as well as selected earlier vulnerabilities. In 2016, Red
Hat adopted the CVSS v3 standard, and all vulnerabilities going
forward will use version 3.1 for scoring. These scores are found on
the
[CVE pages](https://access.redhat.com/security/security-updates/#/cve)
(linked from the References section of each Red Hat Security Advisory).

Red Hat does not solely use the CVSS rating to determine the priority
with which flaws are fixed, or to determine the severity rating of the
vulnerability. It is used as a guideline to identify and describe key
metrics of a flaw, however the priority for which flaws are fixed is
determined by the overall severity of the flaw using the
aforementioned four-point scale.  CVSS is meant to help customers
prioritize the order in which they remediate flaws.

### CVSS v3 Base Metrics

The CVSS v3 base metrics group covers the constant aspects of a
vulnerability:

* Attack Vector (AV) - Expresses the "remoteness" of the attack and
  how the vulnerability is exploited.
* Attack Complexity (AC) - Speaks to the difficulty of executing an
  attack and what factors are needed for it to be successful. (Along
  with User Interaction, Attack Complexity was formerly part of the
  Access Complexity metric.).
* User Interaction (UI) - Determines whether the attack requires an
  active human to participate or if the attack can be automated.
* Privileges Required (PR) - Documents the level of user
  authentication required for the attack to be successful. (This
  replaces the former Authentication metric.).
* Scope (S) - Determines whether an attacker can impact a component
  beyond its security scope/authority.
* Confidentiality (C) - Determines whether unauthorized parties can
  access data and to what extent.
* Integrity (I) - Measures the impact to the trustworthiness and
  veracity of data.
* Availability (A) - Refers to the impact to accessibility of data or
  services for authorized users.

A formula translates these measurements into a single, numerical base
score, ranging from 0.0 (no risk) to 10.0 (highest risk). Refer to
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.1: User Guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/user-guide)
for detailed descriptions of the base metrics. It is important to note
that the CVSS base metrics were designed to be used with the other
CVSS metric groups, notably the Temporal and Environmental metrics, to
provide an accurate representation of risk in customer environments.
Alone, the Base metrics offer a shallow view of the vulnerability
itself without accounting for deployment or the environment.

### How Red Hat Uses CVSS v3 Base Metrics

We aim to comply with the CVSS v3 standard when assigning base scores,
and Red Hat uses base metrics that reflect how a vulnerability affects
our products specifically.  In addition, we do not use the Qualitative
Severity Rating Scale in the CVSS v3.1 User Guide to rate severity,
and our severity ratings are always based on the aforementioned
four-point scale.  In some circumstances, it may not be obvious why a
flaw received a particular score. The following are some common
vulnerability types with our interpretation and typical scoring:

#### Libraries

It is not always possible to know how third-party applications use
libraries, making it difficult to give accurate CVSS v3 base metrics
for flaws in system libraries. When rating these flaws, we take into
account the way the library is used by applications that we ship, and
also look at other popular software that may use the library in a way
that would cause an issue to be of higher severity, and adjust the
score appropriately.

#### Other Common Scores

Flaws where a local, unprivileged user can cause a kernel to crash
(denial of service) typically score 5.5 (for example,
[CVE-2019-9213](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-9213)).

Flaws that allow a local, unprivileged user to escalate their
privileges to root typically score 7.8 (for example,
[CVE-2019-18634](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-18634)).

Cross-site scripting flaws are generally scored as having Low impact
to Integrity and/or Confidentiality, with no impact to Availability,
in line with scoring from other vendors and NVD. A typical score for
these flaws is 6.1 (for example,
[CVE-2020-11023](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-11023)).

### Base Score Variations Across Products

It is common for a given CVE-named vulnerability to have several
different CVSS base metrics, depending on the product, version, and
architecture. Examples of this include:

* A vulnerability that only affected some architectures. For example,
  [CVE-2019-15031](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2019-15031)
  only affected PowerPC.
* A vulnerability that is mitigated by source code protection
  mechanisms on some platforms. For example,
  [CVE-2018-1125](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-1125)
  could have led to arbitrary code execution on Red Hat Enterprise
  Linux, but it is only a denial of service because it was compiled
  with FORTIFY protections.
* A vulnerability that affected more than one product.  For example,
  [CVE-2020-14060](https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-14060)
  affected a component in both OpenShift and OpenStack.  The severity
  to OpenStack was lower (Low) as compared to OpenShift (Moderate)
  based on its usage; the overall vulnerability itself was rated
  Important.

If CVSS v3 base scores are significantly different across products, we
note that separately wherever possible. If we do not split the score,
we report the metric that gives the highest CVSS v3 base score (the
worst-case outcome).

### Differences Between NVD and Red Hat Scores

For open source software shipped by multiple vendors, the CVSS base
scores may vary for each vendor's version, depending on the version
they ship, how they ship it, the platform, and even how the software
is compiled. This makes scoring vulnerabilities difficult for
third-party vulnerability databases, such as NVD, who can give only a
single CVSS base score to each vulnerability, or when comparing to
other vendors who score based on the characteristics of use in their
own products. See the
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss)
for more information regarding NVD security ratings.

These differences can cause the scores to vary widely. Other reasons
may include how the source code was compiled with certain compiler
flags or hardening technologies that reduce or eliminate the security
severity of a flaw, or how the software is used within the product.
Software running standalone may suffer from a flaw, but its use within
a product may preclude the vulnerable code from ever being used in a
way that could be exploited.

For example, NVD may rate a flaw in a particular service as having
High Impact on the CVSS CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity,
Availability) where the service in question is typically run as the
root user with full privileges on a system. However, in a Red Hat
product, the service may be specifically configured to run as a
dedicated non-privileged user running entirely in a SELinux sandbox,
greatly reducing the immediate impact from compromise, resulting in
Low impact.

For these reasons, we recommend that, whenever possible, you use a
CVSS base score provided by Red Hat in preference to a score from a
third party. Please
[let us know](https://access.redhat.com/site/security/team/contact/)
if you believe we have given an incorrect CVSS v3 base score for a
particular vulnerability. We are happy to discuss and update if
needed.

## Description

![@joelsmith](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/329907?u=32f032dcbf542d469a36257179ab2dfb9c38986e&v=4&size=48)[joelsmith](https://github.com/joelsmith)opened [on Aug 5, 2019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/80983#issue-476838684)

[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L)

The API server mistakenly allows access to a cluster-scoped custom resource if the request is made as if the resource were namespaced. Authorizations for the resource accessed in this manner are enforced using roles and role bindings within the namespace, meaning that a user with access only to a resource in one namespace could create, view update or delete the cluster-scoped resource (according to their namespace role privileges).

**Vulnerable versions:**

Kubernetes 1.7.x-1.12.x

Kubernetes 1.13.0-1.13.8

Kubernetes 1.14.0-1.14.4

Kubernetes 1.15.0-1.15.1

**Vulnerable configurations:**

All clusters that have rolebindings to roles and clusterroles that include authorization rules for cluster-scoped custom resources.

**Vulnerability impact:**

A user with access to custom resources in a single namespace can access custom resources with cluster scope.

**Mitigations prior to upgrading:**

To mitigate, remove authorization rules that grant access to cluster-scoped resources within namespaces. For example, RBAC roles and clusterroles intended to be referenced by namespaced rolebindings should not grant access to `resources:[*], apiGroups:[*]`, or grant access to cluster-scoped custom resources.

**Fixed versions:**

Fixed in v1.13.9 by [#80852](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80852)

Fixed in v1.14.5 by [#80851](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80851)

Fixed in v1.15.2 by [#80850](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80850)

Fixed in master by [#80750](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/80750)

**Fix impact:**

Permission to the correct scope will be required to access cluster-scoped custom resources.

**Acknowledgements:**

This issue was discovered by Prabu Shyam of Verizon Media. Thanks to Stefan Schimanski for the fix, to David Eads for the fix review, and to the release managers for creating the security releases.
