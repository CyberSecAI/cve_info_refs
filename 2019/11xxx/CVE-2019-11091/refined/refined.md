Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11091:

**Summary:**

CVE-2019-11091, also known as Microarchitectural Data Sampling Uncacheable Memory (MDSUM), is a vulnerability affecting some microprocessors that utilize speculative execution. It enables an authenticated local user to potentially perform information disclosure via a side channel. This vulnerability is related to how uncacheable memory is handled during speculative execution.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the way certain microprocessors handle uncacheable memory during speculative execution. Speculative execution is an optimization technique where processors predict and execute instructions before knowing if the results will be needed, which may leave sensitive data in microarchitectural buffers, specifically uncacheable memory. An attacker can potentially exploit this through side-channel analysis, leaking the data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS):** Specifically MDSUM variant which targets uncacheable memory.
*   **Speculative Execution:** Vulnerable processors utilize speculative execution, a core mechanism that results in the transient exposure of the data.
*   **Side-Channel Attack:** The data is not directly exposed; rather, it's inferred through side-channel analysis, such as timing variations while performing speculative execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive data residing in uncacheable memory. This could include kernel data, cryptographic keys, or other sensitive information.
*   The attacker must be able to run untrusted code on the affected system.
*   The data leakage is done via a side channel attack.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the system where the vulnerability exists.
*   **Side-channel Attack:** The exploitation is through a side-channel attack, likely by timing execution differences due to the speculative execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Local User:** An attacker needs to have some level of access to the affected system.
*   **Ability to Execute Code:** The attacker must be able to execute untrusted code, or their own code, on the vulnerable system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Several sources mention that this vulnerability is often grouped with other MDS vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12126, CVE-2018-12127, CVE-2018-12130), collectively addressed as "ZombieLoad" or "Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS)".
*   Mitigation often involves a combination of operating system and/or hypervisor patches, as well as CPU microcode updates.
* Disabling Hyperthreading (SMT) is a mitigation to further reduce risk for some systems, but it has a performance impact and is not a complete solution.
* The CVSS score varies between different sources: e.g., 3.8/Low in the Siemens advisory and the CVE, 6.5/Moderate in SUSE, 5.6/Medium in NVD and 6.5/Medium in Intel advisory. This highlights that CVSS score alone is not sufficient to assess the actual risk for all scenarios.

**Mitigations and Resolutions:**
* Intel has released microcode updates for the affected IntelÂ® Processors that are currently supported on the public github repository.
* Software updates (kernel, hypervisors) also contain mitigations, including methods to clear buffers that store potentially leaked data.
* Defense-in-Depth techniques are recommended to reduce the probability of running untrusted code.
* Disabling HT (Hyper-Threading) is mentioned as a potential workaround but with performance implications.
* System administrators should also update OS patches and BIOS if available.

The analysis is based on the assumption that the information is from trusted sources which include, security advisories, vulnerability databases, and technical documentation from vendors.
