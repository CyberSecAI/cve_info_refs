Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The release notes for firmware version 1.2.05.001 for Linksys RE6300 and RE6400 devices explicitly state that it "Fixed RCE vulnerability issue" and "Fixed vulnerability issue for command injection". These statements identify the root causes as Remote Code Execution (RCE) and Command Injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability: This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.
- Command Injection vulnerability: This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the RCE vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the affected device.
- Successful exploitation of the command injection vulnerability could lead to a variety of impacts such as system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The document does not specify the exact attack vector, but it implies the vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable (RCE), therefore an attack vector over the network is likely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to reach the vulnerable device over the network. The specific network could be the local network or possibly the WAN if the device is configured to be accessible over the internet.
- The attacker would need the technical ability to exploit the specific RCE or Command Injection vulnerability. The specific method of exploitation is not mentioned.

**Additional notes:**
- The release notes credit Rodney Beede for discovering and reporting the vulnerability (CVE-2019-11535)
- The fixes for these issues are included in firmware version 1.2.05.001.
