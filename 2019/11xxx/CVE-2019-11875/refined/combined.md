-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512
Advisory ID: SYSS-2019-002
Product: Blue Prism Robotic Process Automation (RPA)
Manufacturer: Blue Prism
Affected Version(s): Before 6.5.0.12573
Tested Version(s): 6.4.0.8445, Before 6.5.0.12573
Vulnerability Type: Improper Access Control (CWE-284)
Risk Level: High
Solution Status: Fixed
Manufacturer Notification: 2019-02-01
Solution Date: Around 2019-05-10
Public Disclosure: 2019-05-22
CVE Reference: CVE-2019-11875
Author of Advisory: Benjamin Hess, SySS GmbH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
Blue Prism is an RPA platform that enables companies to manage and
deploy their digital workforce composed of software robots.
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
"Blue Prism Digital Workers have Intelligent Automation Skills that make
it easier than ever for organizations to leverage technologies that
deliver true operational agility."
Due to a missing permission check for certain actions on the server side
the software is vulnerable to privilege escalation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
A vulnerability in the access control of the software can be exploited
to escalate privileges. The vulnerability allows for abusing the
application for fraud or unauthorized access to certain information.
The attack requires a valid user account to connect to the Blue Prism
server, but the roles associated to this account are not required to
have any permissions.
First of all, the application files are modified to grant full
permissions on the client side.
In a test environment (or his own instance of the software) an attacker
is able to grant himself full privileges also on the server side.
He can then, for instance, create a process with malicious behavior and
export it to disk.
With the modified client, it is possible to import the exported file as
a release and overwrite any existing process in the database.
Eventually, the bots execute the malicious process.
The server does not check the user's permissions for the aforementioned
actions, such that a modification of the client software enables this
kind of attack.
Possible scenarios may involve changing bank accounts or setting
passwords.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
Using the tool dnSpy [2] the "AutomateAppCore.dll" can be decompiled and
modified. The namespace "BluePrism.AutomateAppCore.Auth" contains the
class "User". The body of the member function with prototype
public bool HasPermission(ICollection perms)
needs to be changed to:
return true;
After compiling the modified assembly and replacing the original library
file, the client grants access to all menus and buttons regardless of
the role of the logged in user.
One can now start the software and sign in to the desired target.
It is then possible to open the tab "Releases", where one may create new
packages or modify existing ones, create new releases or import a
release from disk.
By performing a right-click in the tree with the releases, one can
choose "Import release" and select the corresponding file on disk.
If the file contains a process from the current database that was
modified in a malicious way, the process in the database is overwritten.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
The manufacturer fixed the vulnerability in version 6.5.0.12573.
