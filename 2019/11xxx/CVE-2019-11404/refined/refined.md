Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11404:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of insecure HTTP connections to resolve project dependencies in `build.gradle` files, instead of using HTTPS. This exposes the dependency resolution process to potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure dependency resolution:** The project was configured to download dependencies via HTTP, which does not provide encryption or integrity checks, making it susceptible to tampering.
*   **Lack of integrity check:** The downloaded dependencies are not verified for their integrity, meaning a compromised artifact could be introduced without detection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised build artifacts:** An attacker performing a MITM attack could inject malicious code into the downloaded dependencies. This would result in the build process producing infected JARs or other build artifacts.
*   **Supply chain attack:** Developers using the compromised build artifacts would also be infected, and the infection could propagate even after the initial vulnerability is fixed if the infected artifacts are not purged.
*   **Code execution:** The malicious code introduced via compromised dependencies could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution on the machines of developers and users of the built software.
*   **Data Breaches:** Depending on the injected code, it could lead to data breaches or other unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the developer and the dependency repository could intercept the HTTP requests.
*   **Compromised dependency repository:** While not directly exploited, an attacker gaining control over the dependency repository could also serve malicious artifacts to be included in the build.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must be able to intercept network traffic between the developer and the dependency server. This can occur on public or compromised private networks.
*   **MITM capability:** The attacker needs to have the capability to intercept and modify HTTP traffic.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability was addressed by switching the dependency URLs from `http` to `https`, as seen in the commit `74198da`.
*   The issue was initially reported in issue #35 in the `ank` project and issue #1310 in the `arrow` project, and then fixed with pull requests #36 for `ank` and commit `74198da` for `arrow`.
