The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in Dolibarr ERP & CRM version 9.0.1. This response focuses on the vulnerability described under the heading "Remote Code Execution - Website Module", which is identified as CVE-2019-11201.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The website module's editor allows the inclusion of dynamic code, which is not properly sanitized, allowing for code execution on the host machine.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation and sanitization of user-supplied content within the website module's editor.
- Lack of restrictions on dynamic code inclusion, particularly PHP code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the server with the privileges of the web server user (typically `www-data`).
- Potential to escalate privileges to root, depending on the server configuration.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/dolibarr/website/index.php`.
- The POST request includes malicious PHP code within the `PAGE_CONTENT` parameter which is then executed by the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user with access to the website module's editor.
- Ability to modify website content and include dynamic code.
- The attacker also needs to enable the "dynamic content" setting in the same page to trigger the vulnerability.
