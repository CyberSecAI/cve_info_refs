{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The 74CMS v5.0.1 application lacks proper CSRF protection on the admin user creation endpoint.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can create a new administrator account without the knowledge or consent of the legitimate user.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page (poc.html) containing a form that sends a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint (index.php?m=Admin&c=admin&a=add) with predefined admin credentials. When a logged-in admin user opens this page, the browser automatically submits the form, leading to the creation of a new admin user with the attacker's specified credentials.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in administrator to visit a malicious HTML page. They do not need direct access to the application."
