Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11136:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Insufficient access control in system firmware.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The vulnerability stems from inadequate access control mechanisms within the system firmware of specific Intel processors.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation can lead to:
    - Escalation of privilege: An attacker could gain higher privileges than intended.
    - Denial of service: The system could be made unavailable.
    - Information disclosure: Sensitive information could be exposed to the attacker.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A privileged user is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Affected Products:**
- Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors
- 2nd Generation Intel® Xeon® Scalable Processors
- Intel® Xeon® Processor D Family

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text states that Intel is releasing firmware updates to mitigate this vulnerability.
- The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H`, which further specifies:
    -   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local) - The attack requires local access.
    -   **AC:H** (Attack Complexity: High) - The attack is complex to execute.
    -   **PR:H** (Privileges Required: High) - The attacker needs high privileges on the target system.
    -  **UI:N** (User Interaction: None) - No user interaction is required for exploitation
    -   **S:C** (Scope: Changed) - The vulnerability can impact resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority.
    -   **C:H** (Confidentiality: High) - There is high impact on confidentiality.
    -   **I:H** (Integrity: High) - There is high impact on integrity.
    -   **A:H** (Availability: High) - There is high impact on availability.

This information aligns with the typical description of a firmware vulnerability involving access control issues.
