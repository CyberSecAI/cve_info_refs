Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2019-11720:

**CVE-2019-11720: Character encoding XSS vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the incorrect treatment of certain Unicode characters as whitespace during web content parsing. Instead of triggering parsing errors, these characters are misinterpreted, allowing potentially malicious code to be processed, thus bypassing cross-site scripting (XSS) filters. The issue originates in how Firefox handled certain unicode characters by not properly identifying and handling them as whitespace, leading to a parsing error during script execution.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness lies in the insufficient validation of input characters during HTML parsing. Specifically, certain Unicode characters are not recognized as non-whitespace and, as a result, not properly handled, thus not triggering parsing errors.
    *   **XSS Vulnerability:** This weakness is directly exploitable as a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, where the misinterpreted characters allow the injection of malicious code.
    *   **Character Encoding Issues:** The vulnerability showcases an issue in character encoding and interpretation, which could allow other unintended behaviors.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
     *   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** A remote attacker could use a specially crafted page to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser, allowing the attacker to hijack user sessions, redirect to malicious websites, or perform unauthorized actions on a web application.
     *   **Bypassing XSS Protection:** By injecting the malformed characters, an attacker could bypass existing cross-site scripting filters and sanitation attempts present on a website.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Network:** The primary attack vector is over the network, where a user is tricked into viewing a malicious web page or resource containing the exploitable Unicode characters.
    *   **User Interaction:** The user must interact with a website or application that has been altered to contain malicious character sequences.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the capability to inject code into a web page or resource, usually through a malicious website, or compromising an existing website.
    *   The attacker must also have knowledge of vulnerable Firefox versions to exploit this vulnerability.

Additional notes:
The provided content also highlights the fix for this vulnerability in Firefox versions after 68, which involves improving input validation to avoid treating those Unicode characters as whitespace during HTML parsing.
