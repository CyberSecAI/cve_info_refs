Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11559:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the login page accepting unfiltered URL parameters, leading to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the HRworks login page.
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input within the URL parameters, specifically via `GET` requests.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the login page.
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser session when the crafted URL is visited, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Stealing of sensitive information (e.g., cookies).
    - Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
    - Defacement of the login page.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript.
- The vulnerable parameter is within the URL of the login page.
- An attacker would need to trick a user into clicking a malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with injected JavaScript code.
- They would also need to distribute this URL to the intended victim, for example, via a phishing email or other method.
- No special position or privileges are required beyond the ability to send and trick a user to click a link.
