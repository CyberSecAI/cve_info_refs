### @jdmpapin **[jdmpapin](/jdmpapin)** commented [Jul 17, 2019](#issue-469188917)

Versioner currently treats loads of fields and statics as loop-invariant (when the loop doesn't explicitly write them) and generates versioning tests containing such loads. If another thread writes to a field or static, it's possible for the value observed by the loop body to differ from the value observed in a versioning test. For a load that has been copied into multiple versioning tests, it is even possible to see values that are inconsistent between versioning tests. In particular, after running a versioning test, the property it tests for may no longer hold of the value obtained by repeating the load, so it is incorrect to skip checks.

In the absence of synchronization and calls it is possible to version based on expressions containing such loads by privatizing their values, guaranteeing that the values remain stable throughout the series of versioning tests and the hot loop body. I have changes to do so, but first, treat any node that would need to be privatized as non-invariant to prevent incorrect versioning.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Should we have an api like this generalized to a code location where other optimizations that have a notion of invariance, e.g. PRE and local CSE can also call ?

Quite possibly - I recently observed PRE hoisting a load of `j9methodConstantPoolSymbol`. However, for the sake of this fix I'd like to leave this logic here, to be moved afterward if desired, if that's okay with you.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=549192#c0)  Charlie Gracie [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-07-11 14:25:27 EDT  ``` project: Eclipse OMR versions: all  cwe: CWE-367 <http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/367.html> The software checks the state of a resource before using that resource, but the resource's state can change between the check and the use in a way that invalidates the results of the check. This can cause the software to perform invalid actions when the resource is in an unexpected state.  summary: All builds of Eclipse OMR contain a bug where the loop versioner may fail to privatize a value that is pulled out of the loop by versioning - for example if there is a condition that is moved out of the loop that reads a field we may not privatize the value of that field in the modified copy of the loop allowing the test to see one value of the field and subsequently the loop to see a modified field value without retesting the condition moved out of the loop. This can lead to a variety of different issues but read out of array bounds is one major consequence of these problems   - see also <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-1890> ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=549192#c1)  Mark Stoodley [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-07-17 12:03:58 EDT  ``` This problem has now been resolved by <https://github.com/eclipse/omr/pull/4138> ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=549192#c2)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-07-18 09:35:11 EDT  ``` I've assigned CVE-2019-11774 ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=549192#c3)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-12 12:24:44 EDT  ``` The project's 0.1 release scheduled for September 18. Shall I update the version on this CVE to be "all versions prior to 0.1" and submit? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=549192#c4)  Mark Stoodley [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-12 12:27:19 EDT  ``` Sure, sounds reasonable to me (in the absence of any explicit way to refer to such "releases" :) ) ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=549192#c5)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-12 13:07:08 EDT  ``` I've created a pull-request with the central authority.  <https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/pull/2543> ``` |  |
