Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11881:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of the `errorMsg` parameter in the `/login` endpoint of Rancher versions up to 2.1.4. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary content into the error message displayed on the login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Web Parameter Tampering:** The vulnerability is a classic case of web parameter tampering, where an attacker manipulates URL parameters to achieve a malicious outcome.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize or validate the input provided through the `errorMsg` parameter.
*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) potential:** Although not explicitly stated in all content, the ability to inject arbitrary content into the error message could be leveraged to perform a reflected XSS attack in specific scenarios where Javascript is injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **UI Manipulation:** Attackers can display arbitrary messages or links to users on the Rancher login page.
*   **Phishing:** This can be used to trick users into clicking on malicious links disguised as part of an error message, which can potentially lead to phishing attacks.
*   **Information Disclosure:** While not immediately apparent from the provided information, an attacker might be able to craft error messages that reveal information about the server or application configuration in certain scenarios.
*   **Reflected XSS (potential):** In cases where the injected content includes Javascript, this could lead to a reflected XSS vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser within the context of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is the manipulation of the `errorMsg` URL parameter in the `/login` endpoint.
*   **Direct URL Access:** Attackers can directly construct a malicious URL with the crafted `errorMsg` and trick victims into accessing it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Rancher instance to send the malicious request
*   **Basic Understanding of URL Parameters:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of how URL parameters work to craft the malicious payload.
*   **Social Engineering (for phishing):** To be effective in phishing attacks, the attacker would need some social engineering to trick users into clicking on the malicious links.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided code diff shows that in the `HandleSamlAssertion` function of the `saml_client.go` file, there was a vulnerability in how the error message was being constructed during SAML authentication failures. Instead of using a hardcoded error message, it was using `UITranslationKeyForErrorMessage` which seems to address the injection issue related to saml authentication. However, this doesn't address the web parameter tampering on the /login endpoint.
*   The exploit script `vancleef.rb` further confirms the ability to inject arbitrary messages on the login page.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerability was fixed in version v2.2.4
