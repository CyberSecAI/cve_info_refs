DATE PUBLISHED: 02/07/2019
AFFECTED VENDORS: Sony
RELEASE MODE: Coordinated release
CVE: CVE-2019-11889, CVE-2019-11890
CVSSv3 for CVE-2019-11889: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)
CVSSv3 for CVE-2019-11890: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
BRAVIA is a brand of Sony Visual Products known as Smart TVs.
These Smart TVs are known to be high standard products.

## DETAILS OF VULNERABILITIES
xen1thLabs has found two vulnerabilities in Sony products and coordinated
the disclosure of these security flaws with Sony. The vulnerabilities have
been found in the Sony Bravia Smart TV by xen1thLabs while auditing the
security of Smart TVs. The list of affected models has not been shared by Sony.
xen1thLabs tested several Sony Bravia Smart TVs.

The summary of the vulnerabilities is:

- CVE-2019-11889 Sony Remote Denial-of-Service Triggered Over HbbTV
Vulnerability:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely crash the HbbTV rendering
engine and block the TV

- CVE-2019-11890 Sony Remote Denial-of-Service Over Wifi / LAN / Internet
Vulnerability:
This vulnerability allows an attacker to remotely crash the Smart TV using
TCP packets.

### 1. CVE-2019-11889 Sony Remote Denial-of-Service Triggered Over HbbTV
Vulnerability
By sending a specifically crafted webpage over HbbTV it is possible to freeze the
television remotely. (please see the presentation at HiTB Dubai 2018 for HbbTV description
<https://conference.hitb.org/hitbsecconf2018dxb/sessions/hacking-into-broadband-and-broadcast-tv-systems/>),

The remote control does not appear to work except the PROG+ and PROG- buttons.
Only changing channels allows to 'un-freeze' the television. Android is supposed
to kill blocked applications.

In order to reproduce the behavior, start by generating a webpage using:

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=index.html bs=1M count=2048
````

Using the software-defined radio, send a DVB-T signal containing a HbbTV application that force
the targeted Smart TV to load a file from a controlled server. By forcing the Smart TV to load
the generated file, it can be observed from the logs, only between 180KB and 250KB are served
before the HbbTV application freezes:

```
vaccess.log:127.0.1.1:80 192.168.1.191 - - [01/Apr/2019:06:40:54 -0400] "GET /hbbtvtest/test3/ HTTP/1.1"

v1.000000000; 2016;)
sony.hbbtv.tv.2016HE"
````
Sony investigated the issue and shared the following analysis:
"MITM attack by http connection is caused by the specification of the HbbTV service".

### 2. CVE-2019-11890 Sony Remote Denial-of-Service Over Wifi / LAN / Internet Vulnerability

An unauthenticated remote attacker can synflood the Smart TV over LAN and Wi-Fi, the smart
television freezes and becomes irresponsive, some programs crash and the television reboots
randomly. No PoC is released due to low complexity level of exploitation as Sony is not
planning to release a security patch.

Sony investigated the issue and shared the following analysis:
"The Sony Product teams have conducted additional research regarding the submission and
identified the following: CVE-2019-1189: DoS over WiFi /LAN - This is due to the performance
of the interrupt operation in the Linux driver".

## SOLUTION
Sony provided the following recommendation:
"Sony's manual instructs users to: Make sure to connect to the Internet or home network
via a router, which will minimize this risk. In addition, these two symptoms can be
recovered by unplugging the power supply cable. The TV cannot be broken and there is no
internal data that can be stolen by these actions." (May 30th, 2019).

And informed xen1thLabs that:
"we will not be releasing any notifications." (June 19th, 2019).
