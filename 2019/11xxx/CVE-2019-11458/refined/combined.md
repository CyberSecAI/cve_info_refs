# CakePHP 3.7.7, 3.6.15 and 3.5.18 released

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP
3.7.7, 3.6.15 and 3.5.18. These releases contain a security related fix for
[CVE-2019-11458](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11458). The
vulnerability affects applications that open serialized content from user input.
When doing so the SmtpTransport can be used to overwrite any file the
webserver has write access to. We’d like to thank Edgaras Janušauskas for
notifying us of this issue and confirming the fix.

## Bugfixes

In addition to the security fix, you can expect the following changes in 3.7.7
See the [changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.7.6...3.7.7) for every
commit.

* Add getName() to View. This method was suggested in a deprecation warning
  but did not exist.
* Cake\Http\Response::withModified() is now compatible with
  DateTimeImmutable objects.
* Improved API documentation.
* Fixed accidental return type change in Cache::deleteMany().
* FileEngine no longer emits warnings when cache files are written to during
  shutdown when the previous write is for the same key.
* CommandRunner now gracefully handles StopException now.
* Fixed side-effect in SmtpTransport destructor.

## Contributors to 3.7.7

Thank you to all the contributors that helped make this release happen:

* ADmad
* Edgaras Janušauskas
* Mark Scherer
* Mark Story
* saeideng

As always, we would like to thank all the contributors that opened issues,
created pull requests or updated the documentation.

[CakePHP 5.1.5 released](/cakephp/cakephp/releases/tag/5.1.5)
[Latest](/cakephp/cakephp/releases/latest)

[Latest](/cakephp/cakephp/releases/latest)

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 5.1.5. This is a maintenance release with a security fix for the 5.1 branch that fixes several community reported issues and regressions. If you are having problems with the framework breaking your application when you upgrade from 5.0.11 to 5.1, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

## Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 5.1.5. See the `[changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/5.1.4...5.1.5) for every commit.

* Streamline composer dependencies. `lib-ICU` is already an implicit dependency through `intl`.
* Improve API docs.
* Minor optimizations, by removing redundant assignments, `empty()` and `isset()` checks.
* The console package no longer has a hard dependency on `Router`. Instead `Router` will only be used if it is installed.
* Correct column ordering being incorrect in reflected foreign key data with postgres.
* The `EavStrategy` behavior now uses the entity class of the attached table instead of the `Entity` base class.
* `QueryException` now includes the problematic SQL that was created the error.
* The utility package no longer has a hard dependency on the i18n package.
* Fixed falsey value handling in `XmlView`.
* Using cached schema metadata no longer creates a database connection.

## Contributors to 5.1.5

Thank you to all the contributors that submitted a pull request:

* ADmad
* Hermann Vallieri
* Iacovos Constantinou
* Kevin Pfeifer
* Mark Scherer
* Mark Story
* othercorey

As always, we would like to also thank all the contributors that opened issues,

or updated the documentation.

[CakePHP 4.5.9 released](/cakephp/cakephp/releases/tag/4.5.9)

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 4.5.9. This is a maintenance release for the 4.4 branch that fixes a few community reported issues and a security fix.

## Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 4.5.9. See the [changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/4.5.8...4.5.9) for every commit.

* Requests now read the uri from REQUEST\_URI instead of PATH\_INFO. PATH\_INFO has urlescaping applied which enables requests with %2f to be routed when they should not. This could create a security risk for applications that use CDN or loadbalancer rules with paths to be bypassed.
* Fix ORM queries not being able to set read role.

## Contributors to 4.5.9

Thank you to all the contributors that helped make this release happen:

* Jeppe Bonde Weikop for reporting the PATH\_INFO issue.
* Kevin Pfeifer
* Mark Story

As always, we would like to thank all the contributors that opened issues, created pull requests or updated the documentation.

If you are having problems with the framework breaking your application when you upgrade from 5.0.11 to 5.1, please open an [issue](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).

## Bugfixes

You can expect the following changes in 5.1.4. See the [changelog](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/5.1.2...5.1.4) for every commit.

* Relaxed typehints to allow `callable` where previously typehints were `Closure`.
* `aria-invalid` is now be applied to `select` elements.
* Relaxed type hints that were `list` to be `array`.
* Improved API documentation.
* Converted 5xx response codes to 4xx for externally invoked bad URLs.
* `Client\Request` no longer mangles the `Content-Type` header for JSON and XML requests with array data.
* `Paginator` will now trigger warnings when settings have not been applied.
* Request URIs are now read from `REQUEST_URI` instead of `PATH_INFO`. This resolves a potential security issue where paths with `%2f` would be incorrectly handled as `/` by CakePHP.
* Improved CSP compliance in `FormHelper` by replacing inline style attributes with classnames, and inline JavaScript with script blocks when `CspMiddleware` is enabled.
* Fixed off-by-one error on stackframe offests in `ErrorTrap::handleError()`.

## Contributors to 5.1.4

Thank you to all the contributors that submitted a pull request:

* ADmad
* Kevin Pfeifer
* Marc Würth
* Mark Scherer

[CakePHP 5.1.0 released](/cakephp/cakephp/releases/tag/5.1.0)

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the immediate availability of CakePHP 5.1.0. 5.1.0 provides a number improvements to CakePHP. 5.1.0 introduces a small number of deprecation warnings. Any deprecations introduced now will continue to have consistent behavior until their removal in 6.0.0. There is no scheduled date for 6.0.0 at this time.

## Upgrading to 5.1.0

You can use composer to upgrade to CakePHP 5.1.0::

```
php composer.phar require --update-with-dependencies "cakephp/cakephp:5.1.*"
```
## Deprecation Warnings

5.1 introduces a few deprecations. All of these features will continue for the duration of 5.x but will be removed in 6.0. See the [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/appendices/5-1-migration-guide.html).

## What's new in 5.1.0?

The [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/5/en/appendices/5-1-migration-guide.html) has a complete list of what's new in 5.1.0. We recommend you give that page a read when upgrading. A few highlights from 5.1.0 are:

* `RedisEngine` now supports TLS connections.
* `bin/cake plugin list` has been added to list plugin metadata.
* Optional `Command` arguments can now have a `default` value.
* `BannerHelper` was added. This command helper can format text as a banner with a colored background and padding.
* Components can now use the DI container to have dependencies resolved and provided as constructor parameters just like Controllers and Commands do.
* The `toString`, `toInt`, `toBool`, `toDate`, and `toDateTime` functions were added. They give you a typesafe way to cast request data or other input and return `null` when conversion fails.
* `pathCombine()` was added to help build paths without worrying about duplicate and trailing slashes.
* A new `events` hook was added to the `BaseApplication` as well as the `BasePlugin` class.
* Support for `point`, `linestring`, `polygon` and `geometry` types were added to the Database package.
* `SelectQuery::intersect()` and `SelectQuery::intersectAll()` were added.
* `Client` now emits `HttpClient.beforeSend` and `HttpClient.afterSend` events when requests are sent.
* `Http\Server` now emits `Server.terminate` event to run logic after the response has been sent in fastcgi environments. In other environments the `Server.terminate` event runs *before* the response has been sent.
* View cells now emit events around their actions `Cell.beforeAction` and `Cell.afterAction`.
* `Validation::enum()`, `Validator::enum()`, `Validation::enumOnly()`, and `Validation::enumExcept()` were added to further simplify validating backed enum values.
* `HtmlHelper` can now create a meta tag with the CSRF token in it.

## Contributors to 5.1.0

Thank you to all the contributors that helped make 5.1 happen:

* Adam Halfar
* ADmad
* Alejandro Ibarra
* Fernando Herrero
* Frank de Graaf (Phally)
* Jamison Bryant
* J.Brabec
* Jozef Grencik
* Kevin Pfeifer
* KrzysiekNDS
* Mark Scherer
* Mark Story
* Maximilian Ruta
* ndm2
* Nicos Panayides
* othercorey
* Robert Pustułka

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests. 5.1.0 is a large release and would not have been possible without the community support and feedback.

## What's Next

With 5.1.0 shipped, future feature work will continue on `5.next` and eventually form 5.2.0. Bug fixes for 5.1 will be done in the `5.x` branch, and 5.0 will receive security fixes until the release of 5.3.

The roadmap for 5.x is still under development. We're interested in making the upgrade from 5.0 to 5.1 a smooth one, and would appreciate any feedback you have on upgrade difficulties. Please open an issue and get the discussion started.

[CakePHP 5.1.0-RC2 released](/cakephp/cakephp/releases/tag/5.1.0-RC2)

The CakePHP core team is happy to announce the second release candidate for CakePHP 5.1.0. Since the RC1 release the core team has added new features, and includes bugfixes from the 5.0 releases. Some of the highlights of this work include:

* CakePHP will no longer check that `zend.assertions` is enabled in non-debug environments. The related ini setting cannot be controlled at the directory level, and cannot be changed in some shared/cloud hosting environments.
* Fixed `BehaviorRegistry::removeBehavior()` not clearing method maps.
* Fixed deprecations with PHPUnit 11 and made CakePHP base classes compatible with PHPUnit 11.
* Replaced internal usage of `md5` with `xxh128`. This impacts hashes used for group prefixes in `Cache`.
* Fixed `IntegrationTestTrait::enableCsrfToken()` causing GET requests that follow a POST request to fail.
* Added `toFloat()`, `toInt()`, `toString()`, `toBool()`, `toDateTime()`, `toDate()` and `toBool()` to make it more ergonomic to convert request data into type-safe values.
* The new casting functions are used by `ControllerFactory` to cast parameters for controller actions.
* Components can now leverage the dependency injection container in their constructors.
* `Console\Argument::hasArgument()` no longer raises errors when arguments are undefined.
* `ResultSetDecorator` is no longer used internally by the ORM. Instead `ResultSet` is used directly.
* Added support for geospatial types of `GEOMETRY`, `POLYGON`, `POINT`, and `LINESTRING` for database drivers that support them and emulated support for SQLite.
* The request returned by `Router::getRequest()` will now be updated after each middleware is processed, improving request mutations in error pages.
* The default `valueSeparator` for `find(list)` is now a space instead of `;`. This makes results more useful for interfaces.

## What's new in 5.1.0

The [migration guide](https://book.cakephp.org/5.next/en/appendices/5-1-migration-guide.html) has a complete list of what's new in 5.1.0. We recommend you give that page a read when upgrading as it notes the behavior changes present in 5.1.0.

## How you Can Help

You can help deliver 5.1.0 by contributing in one of many ways:

1. Check the `documentation <https://book.cakephp.org/5.next/en/>`\_ for mistakes, outdated, unclear or broken examples. We've been trying to update the documentation as we go, but there are likely examples or sections we've missed.
2. Try it out! Give CakePHP 5.1.0 a test drive. Let us know how upgrading went and if there were any rough spots.
3. File issues for regressions in existing features, or suggest new features. Even if those features don't make it into 5.1.0, we're early in the process of planning 5.2 and value community feedback.

## Contributors to 5.1.0-RC2

Thank you to all the contributors that have contributed to this release:

* Adam Halfar
* ADmad
* Jamison Bryant
* jun-taniai
* Mark Scherer
* Mark Story
* othercorey

As always, a huge thanks to all the community members that helped make this release happen by reporting issues and sending pull requests.

Fix side-effect in destructor

```
SmtpTransport had the potential to create a harmful side-effect
in its destructor should an untrusted value ever be deserialized. This
solves that by removing the socket on wakeup.
