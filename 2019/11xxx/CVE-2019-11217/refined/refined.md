The provided content contains information about CVE-2019-11217.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `GitController` in Bonobo Git Server not sanitizing the user-supplied `serviceName` parameter when calling `GitService.ExecuteServiceByName()`. This lack of input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection (CWE-77): The application directly incorporates user-provided input into a system command without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the web server process.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP Request: A crafted HTTP request is used to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.
- The attacker needs to be able to create a new repository, and manage repository configurations. Specifically, the attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `core.editor` setting.
