    "description": "Function iconv_mime_decode_headers() in PHP versions 7.1.x below 7.1.30, 7.2.x below 7.2.19 and 7.3.x below 7.3.6 may perform out-of-buffer read due to integer overflow when parsing MIME headers. This may lead to information disclosure or crash.",

      {
        "root_cause": "An integer overflow in the `_php_iconv_mime_decode()` function within iconv.c leads to an out-of-bounds read. The loop condition `str_left > 0` is bypassed due to an integer underflow when `str_left` is decremented after reaching zero, resulting in it becoming a very large value, and a subsequent read outside of the intended buffer.",

          "Integer overflow",
