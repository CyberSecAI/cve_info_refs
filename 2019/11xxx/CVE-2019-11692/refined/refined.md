    "Metadata": {
      "ID": "CVE-2019-11692",
      "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability can occur when listeners are removed from the event listener manager while still in use, resulting in a potentially exploitable crash.",
      "Severity": "High",
      "Products": [
        "Firefox ESR",
        "Firefox",
        "Thunderbird"
      ],
      "Versions": [
        "60.7",
        "67",
        "60.7"
      ],
      "Announced": "May 21, 2019"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Use-after-free in the event listener manager.",
      "Weakness": "When listeners are removed from the event listener manager while still in use, a use-after-free vulnerability can occur.",
      "Impact": "Potentially exploitable crash.",
      "Attack Vector": "Removing listeners from the event listener manager while they are still in use.",
      "Reporter": "Nils",
      "Affected Code": "mozilla::dom::WakeLock::Release, UnlinkSelf in CallbackObjectHolder, mozilla::EventListenerManager::RemoveAllListeners, nsHTMLDocument::Open, nsHTMLDocument::WriteCommon",
      "Fix": "Don't let one reuse unlinked CallbackObjectHolder by changing UnlinkSelf to clear mPtrBits before calling Release. This prevents RemoveEventListenerByType from operating on freed memory."
