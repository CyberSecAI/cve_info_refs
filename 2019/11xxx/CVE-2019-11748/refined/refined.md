  "CVE-2019-11748": {
    "description": "WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 69 and Firefox ESR < 68.1.",
    "root_cause": "Firefox was honoring persisted permissions for microphone and camera access granted to sites, even in third-party contexts, due to a flaw in how the browser handled WebRTC permissions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper handling of persisted permissions",
      "Third-party context permissions not properly isolated"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious actor could embed a trusted WebRTC resource within their webpage, and if the user has previously granted permission for camera or microphone access to that trusted resource, the embedded resource could utilize these permissions without requiring any new prompts from the user. This would allow the malicious actor to potentially gain access to the user's camera and microphone without their knowledge. This is particularly relevant when the WebRTC resource is embedded in a hidden iframe within the malicious website.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Embedding a trusted WebRTC resource via a hidden iframe within a malicious web page.",
      "Using a malicious deep link to an attacker-created room on an already-trusted WebRTC site."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create a malicious website or embed the attack within an existing one.",
      "Ability to setup or use a WebRTC site"
    ],
     "required_attacker_position": "The attacker needs to be able to serve malicious content to a target user's browser. This could be via a website the user visits, or some other mechanism for delivering web content (like a malicious ad)"
