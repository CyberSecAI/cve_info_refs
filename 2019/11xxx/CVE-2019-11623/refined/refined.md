Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-11623:

**CVE-2019-11623:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `configurationRequest.php` file when handling the `siteweb` action. Specifically, the code directly uses user-supplied data within a SQL query without adequate escaping or parameterization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is a SQL injection vulnerability. The application directly inserts user-controlled data into SQL queries, allowing for arbitrary SQL code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to gain access to sensitive database information, such as user credentials, system settings, and other critical data.
    *   **Potential for System Compromise:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries could potentially be leveraged to modify data, escalate privileges or, in some scenarios, gain system level access by using database features such as `xp_cmdshell` if enabled.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/dg-user/?controller=configuration&action=siteweb` endpoint. This request includes malicious SQL injection code within the `configuration_siteweb_slogan` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Administrator Privilege:** The attacker needs to be logged in as a background administrator or a user with permission to manage the configuration's `siteweb` settings.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target system running the vulnerable DoorGets CMS.

**Technical Details from the Content:**

The provided content includes detailed steps on how to exploit this vulnerability, showing how to modify the `configuration_siteweb_slogan` parameter within the POST request to inject SQL code and retrieve database information, specifically the database user. The injection point resides in the `UPDATE` query targeting the `_website_traduction` table.

**In summary, CVE-2019-11623 is a SQL injection vulnerability in DoorGets CMS that arises from insecure handling of user input within a specific administrator configuration setting. An authenticated attacker with sufficient permissions can leverage this vulnerability to read or modify sensitive data within the database.**
