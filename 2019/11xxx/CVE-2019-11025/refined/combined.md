## Description

![@SegfaultMasters](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/42465102?u=da03c64e56d570a6401fd3deb2ae3d126f804179&v=4&size=48)[SegfaultMasters](https://github.com/SegfaultMasters)opened [on Mar 28, 2019](https://github.com/Cacti/cacti/issues/2581#issue-426407384)

**Describe the bug**

There's no escape being done before printing out the value of `SNMP community string` (SNMP Options) in the `View poller cache`.

**To Reproduce**

Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Login as normal user ( should have device creation explicitly enabled ).
2. Select create a new device from the console menu.
3. Enter the below shared payload into the "`SNMP community string" field & save the device. Payload -` <script> alert('XSS'); document.location.replace('//google.com');</script>`
4. Now login as an `Admin` user & go to Utilities > System utils > View poller cache, XSS would be trigerred & redirected to google.com as specified in the payload. .

**Expected behavior**

Proper filtration & escaping needs to be done, before taking in the data from the user.

**Screenshots**

Version        : 0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u2

Debian Bug     : 926700 949996

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in Cacti, a web interface for
graphing of monitoring systems, leading to authentication bypass and
cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker may get access to unauthorized
areas and impersonate other users, under certain conditions.

CVE-2018-10060

    Cacti has XSS because it does not properly reject unintended
    characters, related to use of the sanitize_uri function in
    lib/functions.php.

CVE-2018-10061

    Cacti has XSS because it makes certain htmlspecialchars calls
    without the ENT_QUOTES flag (these calls occur when the
    html_escape function in lib/html.php is not used).

CVE-2019-11025

    No escaping occurs before printing out the value of the SNMP
    community string (SNMP Options) in the View poller cache, leading
    to XSS.

CVE-2020-7106

    Cacti has stored XSS in multiple files as demonstrated by the
    description parameter in data_sources.php (a raw string from the
    database that is displayed by $header to trigger the XSS).

CVE-2020-13230

    Disabling a user account does not immediately invalidate any
    permissions granted to that account (e.g., permission to view
    logs).

CVE-2020-23226

    Multiple Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities exist in
    multiple files.

CVE-2021-23225

    Cacti allows authenticated users with User Management permissions
    to inject arbitrary web script or HTML in the "new_username" field
    during creation of a new user via "Copy" method at user_admin.php.

CVE-2022-0730

    Under certain ldap conditions, Cacti authentication can be
    bypassed with certain credential types.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.

For the detailed security status of cacti please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/cacti>
