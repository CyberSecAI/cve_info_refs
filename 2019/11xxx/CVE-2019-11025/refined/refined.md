Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11025:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper output sanitization in Cacti. Specifically, the SNMP community string, which is user-supplied data, is printed directly to the "View poller cache" page without any HTML escaping or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. This occurs because the application stores user input (SNMP community string) without sanitizing it. When this stored data is later displayed on a page (View poller cache), it's treated as HTML/JavaScript and is executed by the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the SNMP community string. When an administrator views the poller cache, this script will execute in their browser. This could lead to:
    - **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the administrator's session cookies.
    - **Account Takeover:** Gaining complete control of the administrator's account.
    - **Data Theft:** Exfiltrating sensitive data from the Cacti system.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting the admin to a malicious site (as shown in the example).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Field:** The vulnerable input field is the "SNMP community string" field when creating a new device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:**  The attacker needs to be a Cacti user with the ability to create or modify devices with the appropriate settings.
- **Admin Interaction**: The attacker relies on an administrator logging into the application and viewing the poller cache to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `utilities.php` line 1849, where the community string is printed without any escaping.
- The fix requires proper HTML escaping of the community string before displaying it in the poller cache.
- The issue was reported on March 28, 2019 and fixed in version `0.8.8b+dfsg-8+deb8u7` for Debian 8 and `0.8.8h+ds1-10+deb9u2` for Debian 9.
