Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerabilities:

**CVE-2019-11389 is RELATED to the provided content.**

The provided content discusses two separate issues (#1372 and #1356) in the `owasp-modsecurity-crs` repository, both related to vulnerable regular expressions that could lead to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) attacks.

**Issue #1372:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within a complex regular expression, specifically in the part `(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[^\"'`]+[\"'`])+|(?:^[\"'`\\\\]*?[\d\"'`]+)+)\s*?(?:n(?:and|ot)`.  The alternate sub-patterns and adjacent character classes that match the same characters cause excessive backtracking in the regex engine.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The regular expression is vulnerable to ReDoS due to nested repetition operators and intersecting alternate patterns which lead to catastrophic backtracking when crafted input is provided.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition by providing specially crafted input strings that force the regex engine to perform excessive computations, consuming excessive resources.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By sending HTTP requests with the crafted payloads in the request body.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests that pass through ModSecurity and trigger the vulnerable regular expression.

**Issue #1356:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by nested repetition operators and intersecting alternate patterns within the regular expression in `/crs/rules/REQUEST-933-APPLICATION-ATTACK-PHP.conf` on line 642.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The regular expression is vulnerable to ReDoS due to its complexity and the potential for excessive backtracking
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:** By providing a specific string like  `next###########################################################################################` to trigger the backtracking
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to send HTTP requests that can pass through ModSecurity and trigger the vulnerable regular expression.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The researcher who reported the vulnerabilities explicitly mentioned that the "exploit strings" provided were not complete attack vectors but rather examples to demonstrate the vulnerable parts of the regular expressions.
*   The issues were reported in April 2019, and the repository was archived in May 2020.

In summary, the content describes two instances of ReDoS vulnerabilities in ModSecurity's regular expressions, both caused by complex patterns, nested repetitions, and overlapping character classes that trigger excessive backtracking.
