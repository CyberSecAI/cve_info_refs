The provided content describes a vulnerability in the WiFi FTP Server application for Android, version 1.8.3. This vulnerability allows for credential disclosure.

**Root Cause:** The application stores sensitive information (username and password) in an insecure manner within the shared preferences file, specifically located at `/data/data/com.medhaapps.wififtpserver/shared_prefs/com.medhaapps.wififtpserver_preferences.xml`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Data Storage:** The application stores user credentials in plaintext within an XML file, without proper encryption or access controls.
*   **Credential Disclosure:** The stored username and password can be easily retrieved by an attacker who gains access to the device file system.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who gains access to the shared preferences file can obtain the username and password used for the FTP server. This allows unauthorized access to the FTP server and the files it hosts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Physical Access:** An attacker who has physical access to a device with the application installed could potentially access the file system and extract credentials.
*   **Malware:** Malicious applications or malware running on the same device could potentially read and extract the credentials from the shared preferences file.
*   **Root Access:** An attacker with root access to the device could readily access and extract the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to have some level of access to the device's file system, either through physical access, malware, or root access.
*   The attacker needs to know the path to the shared preference file (`/data/data/com.medhaapps.wififtpserver/shared_prefs/com.medhaapps.wififtpserver_preferences.xml`).
