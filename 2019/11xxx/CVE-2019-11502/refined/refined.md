Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11502:

**Root Cause:**

- The `/tmp` directory within a snap container was owned by the first user who entered the container. This resulted in incorrect permissions for subsequent users of the same container.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Incorrect Ownership:** The primary weakness was that the private `/tmp` directory created for a snap container was not owned by `root:root`. It was instead owned by the first user to access it.
- **Shared Resource:** Snap containers can be used by multiple users simultaneously, or by privileged daemons. This meant the `/tmp` directory, intended as a temporary storage for that container, was susceptible to access issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unspecified Impact**: An attacker could remove or replace files and directories within the container's `/tmp` directory belonging to other users within the same container.
- **Data Modification/Deletion:** This would compromise the security of files and directories in the shared `/tmp` directory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multiple users sharing a snap container:** An unprivileged user could access a snap container after another user had already accessed it.
- **Privileged programs or daemons running in a container:** These could be affected by the incorrect ownership, leading to unexpected behavior.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to a snap container:** An attacker would need to be able to use snap and start a snap application.
- **Awareness of shared /tmp:** An attacker needs to know that /tmp is shared between users in a container, and that they can interfere with other users by manipulating files in this directory.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the private `/tmp` directory is owned by `root:root`.
- The issue was present up to and including snapcraft version 2.37.4.
- The provided github commit ([3] in the first message, also included as github content) addresses this vulnerability.
