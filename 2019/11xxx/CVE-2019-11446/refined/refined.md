Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11446:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability lies in the "file_manager" module of ATutor, specifically in the file upload functionality.
- The `$IllegalExtensions` function, which is intended to block the upload of dangerous file types, has a weakness: it performs case-sensitive checks on file extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Arbitrary File Upload:** The file upload mechanism in the "File Manager" allows users to upload files without proper validation.
- **Case-Insensitive Bypass:** The `$IllegalExtensions` function performs case-sensitive checks. This can be bypassed by altering the case of file extensions like ".phP" or ".Php".
- **Dangerous Extensions:** In addition to the case-sensitivity bypass, the filter does not block extensions like "shtml" and "phtml" that can be used to execute server-side code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious PHP file (or similar), an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the webserver user.
- **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to full server compromise, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or use the server for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface of the ATutor application, specifically through the file manager's upload functionality.
- **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a file with a malicious payload and a bypassed file extension.
- **HTTP Requests:** The exploit uses HTTP requests to interact with the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Teacher Account Access:** The attacker needs to have a valid teacher account in the ATutor application to access the file manager.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable ATutor server.
- **Knowledge of Content Directory:**  The attacker needs to know or be able to determine the path to the "content" folder. This path is typically defined in the `config.inc.php` file.

**Additional Details:**

- The exploit is facilitated by a Metasploit module, which automates the exploitation process.
- The Metasploit module handles the authentication, course creation (if needed), file uploading, and payload execution.
- The module bypasses the case-sensitive extension check by uploading files with extensions like ".phP".
- The module uses a CSRF token for course creation.

In summary, this is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker with a teacher account to achieve remote code execution by uploading a malicious file and bypassing weak file extension filters.
