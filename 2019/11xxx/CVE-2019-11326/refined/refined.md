Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2019-11326:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The Topcon Net-G5 GNSS Receiver's web interface has a "Guest Login" feature. When this is used, the login form is automatically filled with credentials and a login action is performed. After logging in as a guest, a file containing admin credentials can be accessed via the webserver.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** The "Guest Login" grants access to the web interface. The system stores the administrator password in a file named `adminpasswd` accessible via the webserver. This allows an attacker to escalate privileges from a guest to an administrator.
*   **Credential Exposure:** The `adminpasswd` file is accessible via the web server, leaking the administrator credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can obtain full administrator access to the device's web interface by accessing the `adminpasswd` file.
*   With admin privileges, the attacker can access other features like the file explorer and firmware update functionalities.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable through the device's web interface via HTTP/HTTPS.
*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the device (adjacent network).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be able to access the web interface of the Topcon Net-G5 GNSS Receiver. This means the attacker needs to be on the same network as the device, or have access through network tunneling, such as a VPN.

**Additional details:**

*   The affected firmware version is 5.2.2 Dec.06.2018.
*   The CVSS v3 score is 8.8 (High).
*   The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the `adminpasswd` file using the URL `/receiver/settings/users/roles/adminpasswd` on the device.
*   A similar vulnerability exists to expose the user password via `/receiver/settings/users/roles/userpasswd`
