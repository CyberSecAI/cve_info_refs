Here's a breakdown of the CVE-2019-11253 vulnerability, based on the provided text:

**1. Vulnerability Description:**

*   **Type:** Denial of Service (DoS)
*   **Location:** Kubernetes API server (kube-apiserver)
*   **Cause:** Improper input validation during JSON/YAML parsing.  The API server is vulnerable to a "Billion Laughs" attack (XML entity expansion), leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected Payloads:** Malicious YAML or JSON payloads.
*   **Impact:** Excessive CPU or memory consumption by the kube-apiserver, potentially causing it to crash and become unavailable.

**2. Affected Versions:**

*   Kubernetes v1.0.0 - 1.12.x
*   Kubernetes v1.13.0 - 1.13.11
*   Kubernetes v1.14.0 - 1.14.7
*   Kubernetes v1.15.0 - 1.15.4
*   Kubernetes v1.16.0 - 1.16.1

**3. Attack Vector:**

*   An authorized user sends a malicious YAML or JSON payload to the kube-apiserver.
*   Prior to v1.14.0, anonymous users were authorized by default RBAC policy to submit requests that could trigger this vulnerability. Clusters upgraded from a version prior to v1.14.0 keep the more permissive policy by default for backwards compatibility.

**4. Severity:**

*   High
*   CVSS v3 Score: 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)

**5. Mitigation:**

*   Managing authorization rules and/or access to the Kubernetes API server.  Requests that are rejected by authorization do not trigger the vulnerability.
*   Apply the more restrictive v1.14.x+ RBAC policy.
*   For versions prior to v1.14.0, turn off autoupdate for the `system:basic-user` clusterrolebinding.

**6. Fix:**

*   The vulnerability is resolved by bumping the `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` dependency to v2.2.4.
*   Patches are available in:
    *   Kubernetes v1.13.12
    *   Kubernetes v1.14.8
    *   Kubernetes v1.15.5
    *   Kubernetes v1.16.2
*   Fixed in master by [#83261](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/83261)

**7. Additional Information:**

*   The issue was initially reported as client-side CPU usage, but later investigation revealed resource consumption could occur on the `kube-apiserver`.
*   The provided content includes links to commits that fix the issue, as well as references to Red Hat Security Advisories (RHSA) that address the vulnerability in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform.

**8. NetApp Products:**

*   Multiple NetApp products incorporate Kubernetes. NetApp states that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).
*   NetApp Security Advisory NTAP-20191031-0006 addresses this CVE, stating that none of their products are affected, and lists many products that are not affected.

In summary, CVE-2019-11253 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Kubernetes API server that can be exploited by sending crafted YAML or JSON payloads. The vulnerability stems from improper input validation during parsing, leading to excessive resource consumption. Mitigation involves restricting access to the API server and applying updated RBAC policies. The vulnerability is fixed in later versions of Kubernetes, which include an updated YAML parsing library.
