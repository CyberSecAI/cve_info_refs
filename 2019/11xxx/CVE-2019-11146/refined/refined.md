Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11146:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
Improper file verification in the Intel速 Driver & Support Assistant.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The Intel速 Driver & Support Assistant, before version 19.7.30.2, does not properly verify files. This lack of verification creates a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An authenticated user can potentially achieve an escalation of privilege. This means an attacker with low-level access could gain higher-level privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
Local access is required.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be an authenticated user with local access to the system where the vulnerable Intel速 Driver & Support Assistant is installed. User interaction is required.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity with a CVSS base score of 6.7.
*   The vulnerability is present in versions of Intel速 Driver & Support Assistant before 19.7.30.2.
*   The CVSS vector is  `CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H` which indicates:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local)** - The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the system.
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High)** -  The attack is not easily performed and requires specific conditions.
    *   **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low)** - The attacker needs only basic user privileges.
    *  **UI:R (User Interaction: Required)** - The attack requires user interaction.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged)** - The vulnerability exploitation only affects the vulnerable component.
    *  **C:H (Confidentiality: High)** - There is a high impact on confidentiality.
    *   **I:H (Integrity: High)** - There is a high impact on integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability: High)** - There is a high impact on availability.
* Intel recommends updating to version 19.7.30.2 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
* The advisory also acknowledges Eran Shimony for reporting this issue.
