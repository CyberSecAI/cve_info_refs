## Security vulnerabilities fixed in Firefox 69

Announced
September 3, 2019
Impact
critical
Products
Firefox
Fixed in

* Firefox 69

#### [#CVE-2019-11751: Malicious code execution through command line parameters](#CVE-2019-11751)

Reporter
Ping Fan (Zetta) Ke of VXRL working with iDefense Labs
Impact
critical
##### Description

Logging-related command line parameters are not properly sanitized when Firefox is launched by another program, such as when a user clicks on malicious links in a chat application. This can be used to write a log file to an arbitrary location such as the Windows 'Startup' folder.
*Note: this issue only affects Firefox on Windows operating systems.*

* [Bug 1572838](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1572838)

#### [#CVE-2019-11746: Use-after-free while manipulating video](#CVE-2019-11746)

Reporter
Nils
Impact
high
##### Description

A use-after-free vulnerability can occur while manipulating video elements if the body is freed while still in use. This results in a potentially exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1564449](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564449)

#### [#CVE-2019-11744: XSS by breaking out of title and textarea elements using innerHTML](#CVE-2019-11744)

Reporter
Rakesh Mane
Impact
high
##### Description

Some HTML elements, such as `<title>` and `<textarea>`, can contain literal angle brackets without treating them as markup. It is possible to pass a literal closing tag to `.innerHTML` on these elements, and subsequent content after that will be parsed as if it were outside the tag. This can lead to XSS if a site does not filter user input as strictly for these elements as it does for other elements.

* [Bug 1562033](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1562033)

#### [#CVE-2019-11742: Same-origin policy violation with SVG filters and canvas to steal cross-origin images](#CVE-2019-11742)

Reporter
Paul Stone
Impact
high
##### Description

A same-origin policy violation occurs allowing the theft of cross-origin images through a combination of SVG filters and a `<canvas>` element due to an error in how same-origin policy is applied to cached image content. The resulting same-origin policy violation could allow for data theft.

* [Bug 1559715](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1559715)

#### [#CVE-2019-11736: File manipulation and privilege escalation in Mozilla Maintenance Service](#CVE-2019-11736)

Reporter
Seb Patane
Impact
high
##### Description

The Mozilla Maintenance Service does not guard against files being hardlinked to another file in the `updates` directory, allowing for the replacement of local files, including the Maintenance Service executable, which is run with privileged access. Additionally, there was a race condition during checks for junctions and symbolic links by the Maintenance Service, allowing for potential local file and directory manipulation to be undetected in some circumstances. This allows for potential privilege escalation by a user with unprivileged local access.
*Note: These attacks requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

##### References

* [Bug 1551913](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1551913)
* [Bug 1552206](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1552206)

#### [#CVE-2019-11753: Privilege escalation with Mozilla Maintenance Service in custom Firefox installation location](#CVE-2019-11753)

Reporter
Holger Fuhrmannek
Impact
high
##### Description

The Firefox installer allows Firefox to be installed to a custom user writable location, leaving it unprotected from manipulation by unprivileged users or malware. If the Mozilla Maintenance Service is manipulated to update this unprotected location and the updated maintenance service in the unprotected location has been altered, the altered maintenance service can run with elevated privileges during the update process due to a lack of integrity checks. This allows for privilege escalation if the executable has been replaced locally.
*Note: This attack requires local system access and only affects Windows. Other operating systems are not affected.*

#### [#CVE-2019-11752: Use-after-free while extracting a key value in IndexedDB](#CVE-2019-11752)

Reporter
Zhanjia Song
Impact
high
##### Description

It is possible to delete an IndexedDB key value and subsequently try to extract it during conversion. This results in a use-after-free and a potentially exploitable crash.

* [Bug 1501152](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1501152)

#### [#CVE-2019-9812: Sandbox escape through Firefox Sync](#CVE-2019-9812)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

Given a compromised sandboxed content process due to a separate vulnerability, it is possible to escape that sandbox by loading `accounts.firefox.com` in that process and forcing a log-in to a malicious Firefox Sync account. Preference settings that disable the sandbox are then synchronized to the local machine and the compromised browser would restart without the sandbox if a crash is triggered.

* [Bug 1538008](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1538008)
* [Bug 1538015](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1538015)

#### [#CVE-2019-11741: Isolate addons.mozilla.org and accounts.firefox.com](#CVE-2019-11741)

Reporter
Niklas Baumstark via TrendMicro's Zero Day Initiative
Impact
high
##### Description

A compromised sandboxed content process can perform a Universal Cross-site Scripting (UXSS) attack on content from any site it can cause to be loaded in the same process. Because `addons.mozilla.org` and `accounts.firefox.com` have close ties to the Firefox product, malicious manipulation of these sites within the browser can potentially be used to modify a user's Firefox configuration. These two sites will now be isolated into their own process and not allowed to be loaded in a standard content process.

* [Bug 1539595](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1539595)

#### [#CVE-2019-11743: Cross-origin access to unload event attributes](#CVE-2019-11743)

Reporter
Yoav Weiss
Impact
moderate
##### Description

Navigation events were not fully adhering to the W3C's "Navigation-Timing Level 2" draft specification in some instances for the `unload` event, which restricts access to detailed timing attributes to only be same-origin. This resulted in potential cross-origin information exposure of history through timing side-channel attacks.

#### [#CVE-2019-11748: Persistence of WebRTC permissions in a third party context](#CVE-2019-11748)

Reporter
Jan-Ivar Bruaroey
Impact
moderate
##### Description

WebRTC in Firefox will honor persisted permissions given to sites for access to microphone and camera resources even when in a third-party context. In light of recent high profile vulnerabilities in other software, a decision was made to no longer persist these permissions. This avoids the possibility of trusted WebRTC resources being invisibly embedded in web content and abusing permissions previously given by users. Users will now be prompted for permissions on each use.

##### References

* [Bug 1564588](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564588)

#### [#CVE-2019-11749: Camera information available without prompting using getUserMedia](#CVE-2019-11749)

Reporter
Andreas Pehrson
Impact
moderate
##### Description

A vulnerability exists in WebRTC where malicious web content can use probing techniques on the `getUserMedia` API using constraints to reveal device properties of cameras on the system without triggering a user prompt or notification. This allows for the potential fingerprinting of users.

##### References

* [Bug 1565374](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1565374)

#### [#CVE-2019-5849: Out-of-bounds read in Skia](#CVE-2019-5849)

Reporter
Zhen Zhou of NSFOCUS Security Team
Impact
moderate
##### Description

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the Skia graphics library, allowing for the possible leaking of data from memory.

##### Description

A type confusion vulnerability exists in Spidermonkey, which results in a non-exploitable crash.

##### References

* [Bug 1568397](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397)

#### [#CVE-2019-11737: Content security policy directives ignore port and path if host is a wildcard](#CVE-2019-11737)

Reporter
Xiaoyin Liu
Impact
low
##### Description

If a wildcard ('\*') is specified for the host in Content Security Policy (CSP) directives, any port or path restriction of the directive will be ignored, leading to CSP directives not being properly applied to content.

##### References

* [Bug 1388015](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1388015)

#### [#CVE-2019-11738: Content security policy bypass through hash-based sources in directives](#CVE-2019-11738)

Reporter
Wladimir Palant
Impact
low
##### Description

If a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive is defined that uses a hash-based source that takes the empty string as input, execution of any `javascript:` URIs will be allowed. This could allow for malicious JavaScript content to be run, bypassing CSP permissions.

##### References

* [Bug 1452037](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1452037)

#### [#CVE-2019-11747: 'Forget about this site' removes sites from pre-loaded HSTS list](#CVE-2019-11747)

Reporter
Thomas Henlich
Impact
low
##### Description

The "Forget about this site" feature in the History pane is intended to remove all saved user data that indicates a user has visited a site. This includes removing any HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) settings received from sites that use it. Due to a bug, sites on the pre-load list also have their HSTS setting removed. On the next visit to that site if the user specifies an `http:` URL rather than secure `https:` they will not be protected by the pre-loaded HSTS setting. After that visit the site's HSTS setting will be restored.

For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information. This wiki page is dedicated to collect a comprehensive list of whiteboard tags used in the Mozilla project.

## Whiteboard considered harmful

It is recommended that you request alternative metadata instead of using whiteboard tagging.

* Updating whiteboards tags through the API is non-trivial
* There is no global auto-suggest for whiteboard tags
* There is no verification of whiteboard tags; typos will not be caught and prevented
* Renaming a whiteboard tag requires writing a script to update every bug with that tag, changing its last modified timestamp and generating bugmail; other solutions involve a simple change by administrators
* Whiteboard tags cannot be disabled; people might continue to provide them after they are no longer relevant thinking they still apply
* If desired it's possible to restrict who can set flags to particular values; it will never be possible to prevent accidental or other changes to the whiteboard from any user with editbugs or the bug's reporter

Consider using a keyword, a flag, or a status flag. You can request this on [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).

## Contributor mentoring

For more information, see [Mentors](/Mentors "Mentors").

* `[lang=]`: The programming language involved for this bug.
* `[mentor-lang=]`: (human/natural) language other than English the mentor will be able to communicate to the contributor with.

## Automated Testing

* `[test disabled]`: Indicates an automated test has been disabled. Typically used in bugs filed for intermittent test failures, to indicate that the absence of new failures in the bug is due to the test being disabled - as well as remind module owners that the test needs fixing and re-enabling.

## Autonag

`[no-nag]`: Indicates that a bug should not be modified or commented in by our [Autonag](/Release_Management/autonag "Release Management/autonag") scripts.

## Release Engineering

* `[capacity]`: This bug will help increase (or free up) capacity for our automated build & test machines.

## Sheriffing

* `[leave open]`: This has [been deprecated](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/Ie9OXcWbTSs) in favour of the 'leave-open' keyword. Used to ensure that the bug updating tool mcMerge does not close the bug when commits referencing it are merged into mozilla-central.
* `[retriggered]`: Used by sheriffs when investigating Fresh Oranges [[1]](https://charts.mozilla.org/FreshOranges/index.html) to find where a failure started from, using backfills and retriggers

## Firefox

* `dupeme`, `dupme`, or `DUPEME`: we're pretty sure this bug report is a duplicate of another bug, but cannot recall which one or cannot find it.
* `[qa-]`: QE (Quality Engineering) verification not required - superseded by the qe-verify flag.
* `[adv-mainNN+]` (where `NN` is some number): a security advisory about this bug for the release `NN` will be (has been) written.
* `[MemShrink]`: [a project](/Performance/MemShrink "Performance/MemShrink") to reduce memory consumption.

## Community reported bugs

* `[nightly-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the Firefox Nightly community. Used to triage community-reported bugs and measure the impact of our core community on product quality.
* `[mozfr-community]`: This bug was reported by a member of the MozFR French-speaking community. Used to evaluate the impact of the mozfr.org community on product quality.

## Firefox OS

[Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes](/index.php?title=Template:Note:_This_project_is_no_longer_active,_but_we_leave_these_definitions_for_bug_tracker_historian_purposes&action=edit&redlink=1 "Template:Note: This project is no longer active, but we leave these definitions for bug tracker historian purposes (page does not exist)")

* `[POVB]`: Part of vendor build; the fix of this bug is not in the Mozilla codebase, but it's in our interest to track it.
* `[priority]`: Indicates we are asked by a partner to address this issue with priority.
* `[tarako_only]`: Special pref or feature that only lands on branch for Tarako (low memory phone), i.e. 1.3T branch of Gaia and Gecko. To be picked up on future releases.
* `[p=]/[u=]/[c=]/[s=]`: See [Scrum Development](/BMO/Whiteboard#Scrum_Development "BMO/Whiteboard"). Firefox OS uses the u= tag as the milestone instead, see [Firefox OS Performance Triage](/FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage#Scrumbugs_Tags "FirefoxOS/Performance/Triage")
* `[ft:<name of the team>]`, `[systemsfe]`, etc: Bugs identified to be owned by a "functional team" within B2G engineering. Each team owns a specific set of Bugzilla components, and tags are used to denote owned bugs outside of these components.

## Tor

* `[tor ###]` Part of the [Tor uplift project](/Security/Tor_Uplift/Tracking "Security/Tor Uplift/Tracking"). For example, `[tor 16620]` indicates a corresponding ticket at <https://trac.torproject.org/16620>. See also <https://torpat.ch/uplift>

## Web Compatibility

[Our whiteboard keywords](/Compatibility/BugsGuide "Compatibility/BugsGuide") are already described.

## Scrum Development

The following flags are used by tools like [scrumbu.gs](https://scrumbu.gs/help/) for managing sprints using the scrum development framework:

* `[p=]`: A rough estimate from engineer on how long the bug is going to take.
* `[u=]`: The user (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[c=]`: The component (in the scrum sense) that this story affects
* `[s=]`: An explicit sprint slug this bug should belong to.

If you are not managing a product, you probably don't have to set these.

## What does this whiteboard keyword mean?

If you know what one of the following whiteboard keywords means, please describe it and put it into one of the above categories above (or create a new one):

* `[2.0-FL-bug-bash]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1021384>)
* `[games]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1017892>)
* `[reserve-photon-structure]` ([examples](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?list_id=14108939&status_whiteboard_type=substring&status_whiteboard=%5Breserve-photon-structure%5D&order=Bug%20Number&query_format=advanced))
* `[TCP]` (example: <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=920036>)
  + my guess: Tablet Contribution Program?

Steps to reproduce:

1. open the html file with the latest firefox
2. firefox renderer process crash.

Actual results:

1. firefox will crash as type confusion happen between "undefined" and a normal object:

00000071`cb00f521 4c395908 cmp qword ptr [rcx+8],r11 ds:00078000`00000008=????????????????

Expected results:

1. not crash

Here is a type confusion bug in SpiderMonkey.

The root cause is in function |AnalyzeNewScriptDefiniteProperties|, the in parm |group| is the finial |initializedGroup\_|, but this

group will call |detachNewScript|.

So in the function |AnalyzeNewScriptDefiniteProperties| => |AnalyzePoppedThis| => |AddClearDefiniteGetterSetterForPrototypeChain|, the in parm still |initializedGroup\_| which will be detach NewScript soon.

So even if we change the |**proto**| of prototype chain, SpiderMonkey will call |newPropertyState| => |group->clearNewScript|, because the group was call |detachNewScript|, so it will nothing happen in |clearNewScript|.

I think we should use |initialGroup|(in |maybeAnalyze|) in function |AddClearDefiniteGetterSetterForPrototypeChain|

Just moving this to JS land - I can reproduce a tab crash on nightly, though I see a nullptr crash there: <https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/e581285c-71db-4ac5-9b67-1d39f0190724> , but I'm not familiar with the JS engine myself so don't know about [comment #1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - SpiderMonkey uninitialized memory leads to Type Confusion between \"undefined\" with any object").

Testcase in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - SpiderMonkey uninitialized memory leads to Type Confusion between \"undefined\" with any object") is reduced from the original testcase attached. Looks like the usual type confusion MIR assert, we have to assume this is exploitable somehow until Jan has investigated this. Marking sec-high until we know more. Also assuming all branches are affected because it was reported on 68.

Gary, can you bisect the testcase in [comment 3](/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397#c3 "RESOLVED FIXED - SpiderMonkey uninitialized memory leads to Type Confusion between \"undefined\" with any object") please?

p = new Proxy({}, {
    set: function(a, b, c) {

This is an old bug. Before m-c rev 410d733097ac, the assertion failure was a crash at a weird memory address. I went back as far as m-c rev 514c80664661 (Mar 2015) but the crash still happens.

Jan will have to take this on.

I poked at this a little bit this afternoon. I'm attaching a slightly more reduced testcase (the proxy is irrelevant) with some comments explaining what (I think) is going on.

I have no idea what the fix is.

And here's a version of gkw's testcase without the proxy:

```
m = {
    get e() {
        function g(z) {
            return z.y.x;
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < 1; i++) {
            g(x);
        }
        g(this);
    }
};
function foo(c) {
    x = c;
    new f("", 3);
}
function f(u, v) {
    if (v == 3) {
        f.prototype.__proto__ = m;
    }
    this.e;
    this.y = u;
    if (v == 2) {
	global = this
    }
    this.n = 2;
    foo(this)
}

Hello,

In face, the root cause I was explained in [comment 1](/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397#c1 "RESOLVED FIXED - SpiderMonkey uninitialized memory leads to Type Confusion between \"undefined\" with any object"), so you can generate a minimization poc through it if you want.

And how to fix this bug is the same.

The definite properties analysis handles these two cases:

1. The set of properties found by the analysis exactly matches the ones of the preliminary objects. This is the simple case: these properties are marked as definite properties, there's a single group for everything.
2. The preliminary objects have more properties than the analysis found. That's what happens here.

To handle case 2:

* We create a new group (initialGroup). This group has just the properties found by the analysis.
* The initialGroup becomes the default group for new objects and this group has the TypeNewScript associated with it, instead of the original (fully initialized) group.
* The TypeNewScript stores the original shape and group: whenever a property addition results in an object having that shape, we change its group from initialGroup to the fully initialized group.

The reporter is correct about the problem with this scheme: the prototype constraints still reference the *original* (fully initialized) group and that group does not have the TypeNewScript anymore (it's on the initialGroup now) so these constraints effectively become no-ops and we fail to fix up a partially initialized object.

Unboxed object removal helped a lot: I think you can unbox an |undefined| value as something else and get nullptr for objects/strings so it's not easy to exploit. Additionally, on 64-bit platforms our Spectre Value mitigations (XOR unboxing) means some high bits are set after unboxing so you can't do much with that pointer and not crash.

I'm wondering if we can stop handling case 2 in [comment 10](/show_bug.cgi?id=1568397#c10 "RESOLVED FIXED - SpiderMonkey uninitialized memory leads to Type Confusion between \"undefined\" with any object").

Case 1 is more common but removing case 2 would regress some Octane tests a lot (say 40%) so that's not a great spot fix.

As relatively safe fix we could allocate the initial group upfront and pass it also to AnalyzeNewScriptDefiniteProperties and the constraints added there. Then the constraints could call clearNewScript on both groups. That way we don't affect group assignment etc.

We now add information about the constraints to a new class (DPAConstraintInfo)

so we can then finish all constraints at the end. This is also nice to avoid

adding unnecessary constraints when the analysis fails.

I think sec-moderate makes sense considering the only effect we know of is confusion with nullptr. However we should probably keep this closed, backport in a few days, and not land the test yet.

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

A Content-Security-Policy: img-src [https://\*:4433](https://*:4433) should only allow port 4433, but Firefox allows a URL with all ports.
Reproducible in Firefox Stable 54 and Nightly 57.0a1. Not reproducible in Edge and Chrome.
This is the same issue as <https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=682673> in Chromium.

I think the issue is at Line 644 in nsCSPUtils.cpp [1]. If the Host part is \*, the function returns true if the scheme is not one of blob:, data:, or filesystem:, without checking the port or path. I think [Bug 1075230](/show_bug.cgi?id=1075230 "RESOLVED FIXED - ASSERTION: Second character needs to be '.' whenever host starts with '*', going to twitter.com") is related, since
> + // 2) host matching: Enforce a single \*
> + if (mHost.EqualsASCII("\*")) {
> + return true;
> + }
was introduced in the patch for that bug.

Yeah, I think we bail early and allow the load if the wildcard is used for the host without checking the port. I am going to look into that and get that fixed.Assignee: nobody → ckerschbStatus: NEW → ASSIGNEDPriority: -- → P2Whiteboard: [domsecurity-active]

Calling this sec-low because if you'll accept any arbitrary host it would be easy for an attacker to use whatever port they needed to bypass CSP anyway. But sure, if the spec says to enforce port then we should do that.
We should check that path is enforced too.Keywords: [sec-low](/buglist.cgi?keywords=sec-low&resolution=---)

[Bug 1388015](/show_bug.cgi?id=1388015 "RESOLVED FIXED - Partial Content Security Policy bypass if host-part contains wildcard") - Add checks to respect CSP-wildcard + Ports r=ckerschb

### Beta/Release Uplift Approval Request

* **User impact if declined**: The user is left vulnerable to a CSP-Bypass Attack, if the Page uses a "Wildcard+Port" host in its CSP-Rule
* **Is this code covered by automated tests?**: Yes
* **Has the fix been verified in Nightly?**: Yes
* **Needs manual test from QE?**: No
* **If yes, steps to reproduce**:
* **List of other uplifts needed**: None
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The patch just adds a single check in case a "\*" is present in the CSP host declaration,

  all the other Code paths for checking the host are left untouched.
* **String changes made/needed**:

### ESR Uplift Approval Request

* **If this is not a sec:{high,crit} bug, please state case for ESR consideration**: Currently Firefox ignores the Port in a CSP Host declaration if the host is "\*"

  Which opens a Vector for CSP-Bypassing.
* **User impact if declined**: The user is left vulnerable to a CSP-Bypass Attack.
* **Fix Landed on Version**: Nightly 70
* **Risk to taking this patch**: Low
* **Why is the change risky/not risky? (and alternatives if risky)**: The patch just adds a single check in case a "\*" is present in the CSP host declaration,

  all the other Code paths for checking the host are left untouched.
* **String or UUID changes made by this patch**:
