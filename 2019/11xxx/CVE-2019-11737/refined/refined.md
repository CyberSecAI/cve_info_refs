{
  "CVE-2019-11737": {
    "Description": "If a wildcard ('*') is specified for the host in Content Security Policy (CSP) directives, any port or path restriction of the directive will be ignored, leading to CSP directives not being properly applied to content.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Firefox's Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation handles wildcard characters ('*') in the host part of a directive. When a wildcard is used for the host, the code incorrectly bypasses checks for port and path restrictions.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of wildcard characters in CSP host directives.",
      "Failure to enforce port and path restrictions when a wildcard host is used."
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended restrictions of a Content Security Policy (CSP) by exploiting the improper handling of wildcards in the host part, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other security issues if an attacker can load malicious content from an unexpected origin.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious webpage that uses a wildcard ('*') in the host part of a CSP directive along with specific port or path restrictions. Due to the improper handling of the wildcard, the browser will incorrectly ignore these restrictions allowing the attacker to bypass the CSP.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control the content of a webpage or have the ability to inject content into a webpage that utilizes CSP with wildcard hosts. No special privileges are needed to exploit this flaw beyond being able to serve or manipulate a webpage."
