  "description": "Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) and Pulse Policy Secure (PPS) products have been discovered to contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability (CVE-2019-11510), which could allow a remote, unauthenticated actor to view cached plaintext user passwords and other sensitive information. ",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the web server implementation of Pulse Secure. The original path validation was very strict, but since version 8.2, a new feature called 'HTML5 Access' was introduced, loosening the path validation. This allows an attacker to specify '/dana/html5acc/guacamole/' in the query string to bypass the validation and download arbitrary files.",
    "vulnerability": "Pre-auth Arbitrary File Reading vulnerability",
    "impact": "A remote, unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the Pulse Secure SSL VPN server, potentially gaining access to sensitive information like plaintext user passwords, private keys, and system configuration files. An attacker can use these session IDs to impersonate as one of the active users. If a Pulse Secure administrator is currently active and the administrative access is available to the attacker, attacker could gain administrative access to Pulse Secure VPN.",
    "attack_vector": "By sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable Pulse Secure SSL VPN server. The request includes a specific path ('/dana/html5acc/guacamole/') in the URI to bypass path validation.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. They only need network access to the vulnerable Pulse Secure SSL VPN server."
