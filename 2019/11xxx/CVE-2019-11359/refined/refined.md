The provided content details a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `display.php` file of the `i-librarian` project.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the `project` parameter obtained from the GET request before being used in the HTML output.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Reflected XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input being directly printed into the HTML.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `project` parameter, which will be executed in the victim's browser when the page is rendered. This can allow the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or defacing the website.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes malicious JavaScript code in the `project` parameter. The user needs to be tricked into clicking on the malicious link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL and get a victim to visit that URL. The attacker does not need prior access or special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
