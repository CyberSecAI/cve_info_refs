Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11757:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in how Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird handle index updates within the IndexedDB storage mechanism. Specifically, when storing a value in IndexedDB, the code incorrectly followed the value's prototype chain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Use-After-Free (UAF):** The core vulnerability is a use-after-free. During index update creation, the code could retain a reference to a locale, delete it, and subsequently attempt to reference it. This results in memory corruption.
- **Prototype Chain Traversal:** The vulnerability stems from the improper traversal of the prototype chain of values being stored in IndexedDB.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Potentially Exploitable Crash:** A successful exploitation of this use-after-free vulnerability could lead to a crash.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the memory corruption caused by use-after-free, it's plausible that with enough effort, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Web Content:** The primary attack vector is through malicious web pages that leverage IndexedDB to trigger the vulnerability. A website with malicious Javascript can manipulate the IndexedDB to create a vulnerable condition.
- **Email Clients:** Although less direct, it seems the vulnerability can affect email clients because they could be used to display web content in a browser-like context.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to serve or inject malicious web content:** The attacker needs to be able to serve malicious web content to a user. This could be through a compromised website, a malicious advertisement, or any other channel that allows arbitrary JavaScript to run.
- **User Interaction:** The user typically needs to open the malicious web page in Firefox or Thunderbird for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Zhanjia Song and is related to other use-after-free issues within the IndexedDB component.

- The fix implemented for this vulnerability involved stopping the following of the prototype chain for values in IndexedDB.
- The vulnerability was deemed to be sec-high.
