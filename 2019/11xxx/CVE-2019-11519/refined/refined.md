The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11519.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML files during the language resource import process in nopCommerce. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **XXE Injection:** The application processes external entities defined within an uploaded XML file without proper sanitization or disabling of external entity processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **File Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from the server's file system. In the reported case, the attacker uses a "blind XXE," meaning that the file's content is not directly returned in the response, but rather via out-of-band techniques like using Burp Collaborator.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **XML File Upload:** The attacker uploads a maliciously crafted XML file through the "Import Resources" functionality within the language editing section. This file contains external entity declarations pointing to server-side files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to have access to the nopCommerce admin panel to reach the "Configurations -> Languages -> Edit Language -> Import Resources" section.
*   The attacker needs to be able to upload XML files.
