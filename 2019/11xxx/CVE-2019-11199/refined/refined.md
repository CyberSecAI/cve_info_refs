Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2019-11199:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper output encoding in the `viewimage.php` page when displaying user-uploaded files. Specifically, the application uses the user-supplied MIME type without sanitization when displaying content. This allows for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS.  User-uploaded files are not properly sanitized, and the application uses the user-specified MIME type, leading to the execution of JavaScript code.
- The application suffixes uploaded files with a `.noexe` extension to prevent direct execution, but this is circumvented by the vulnerability in `viewimage.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Client-Side Code Execution:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will execute in the victim's browser when they view the malicious content.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can use the XSS vulnerability to target administrative users.  The report specifically notes that this could be used to add arbitrary users (including the active account) to the administrators group and escalate their privileges.
- **Account Takeover:** By compromising an administrator's account, the attacker can gain complete control over the application and all of its data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **File Upload:** An attacker uploads a malicious HTML file containing JavaScript code via the application's upload functionality.
- **MIME Type Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a request to `viewimage.php` that specifies `text/html` as the MIME type for the uploaded file.
- **User Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user (including an administrator) accesses the malicious file through `viewimage.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be a low-privileged user of the application, capable of uploading files.
- The attacker needs to be able to trick a user to open the manipulated link.
- No other special capabilities or network access are required. The vulnerability can be exploited over the network.
