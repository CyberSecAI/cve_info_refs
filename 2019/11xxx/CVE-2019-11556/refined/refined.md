{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The pagure application did not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the blame view, leading to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the blame view, potentially allowing them to perform malicious actions in the context of other users' browsers. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other forms of unauthorized access.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability can be triggered by viewing a crafted blame.html page."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a commit in a pagure repository that contains malicious HTML in the content that gets displayed in the blame view. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges and can be an unauthenticated user if the project is public."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The vulnerability was addressed by ensuring that the blame view does not render html."
  ]
