The provided content relates to CVE-2019-11780.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a change in the default behavior of computed fields in Odoo 13.0. Computed fields are now computed in "super-user" mode by default. While this is intended for stored fields, non-stored fields can have values that depend on the context of the call and the current user's access level.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper access control in the computed fields system of the Odoo framework allows unauthorized access to sensitive information. The issue lies in the fact that non-stored computed fields, which should respect user context, are computed with superuser privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious authenticated user can craft RPC requests to trigger the computation of non-stored fields, revealing sensitive information and bypassing intended access rights, leading to privilege escalation.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-exploitable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user, which can include external portal users.
