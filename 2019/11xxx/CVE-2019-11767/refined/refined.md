Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the security vulnerabilities addressed in phpBB 3.2.6:

*   **Vulnerability 1: Excessive Load via Fulltext Native Search (CVE-2019-9826)**

    *   **Root Cause:** Previous versions of phpBB allowed users to craft search queries that, when using the fulltext native search engine, could result in long execution times and excessive load, particularly on larger boards.
    *   **Weakness:** Unrestricted or insufficiently limited search query complexity.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to high server load.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted search queries via the web interface.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A regular user could potentially trigger this vulnerability.
*   **Vulnerability 2: Local Network File/Service Existence Testing via Remote Avatar**

    *   **Root Cause:** An edge case existed in the remote avatar functionality that allowed an attacker to test for the existence of files and services on the local network of the host server.
    *   **Weakness:** Improper validation or filtering of URLs used for remote avatars, allowing access to internal network resources.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure - An attacker could potentially determine the presence of internal services or files, which could be a precursor to further attacks.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Specifying a carefully crafted URL pointing to an internal resource as the remote avatar.
    *   **Attacker Capabilities:** A user with the ability to set a remote avatar.
*   **Additional Hardening Measures:**

    *   **Removal of Database Backup Download:** The ability to download database backups via the ACP (Admin Control Panel) UI was removed.
        *   **Reason:** To prevent database compromise if an attacker gains access to a founder account.
    *   **Further Validation of Admin Input:** More validation was added to administrative input within the Admin Control Panel.
        *   **Reason:** To mitigate the potential impact of admin account compromises or rogue administrators.
    *   **Form Tokens on Login:** Form tokens were added to the login box.
        *   **Reason:** To prevent CSRF attacks
