Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2019-11705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow occurs in the `icalrecur_add_bydayrules` function within Thunderbird's iCal implementation. This function is responsible for processing recurrence rules in calendar events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack buffer overflow: The `icalrecur_add_bydayrules` function writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Potentially exploitable crash: The stack buffer overflow can lead to a crash, and given the right conditions an attacker might be able to control execution flow.
-  Arbitrary code execution: According to the Gentoo advisory, successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious email: The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted email messages containing a malicious calendar attachment (`text/calendar`).
-  Specifically, the crafted iCalendar data includes a malformed recurrence rule, which triggers the overflow in `icalrecur_add_bydayrules`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to send the specially crafted malicious email to a Thunderbird user.
-   The user must either open the malicious email message or have the message automatically processed by Thunderbird when received.

**Additional Technical Details:**
-  The vulnerability was identified through fuzzing, a testing technique involving feeding malformed data to software to find bugs.
-  The crash occurs in `icalrecur.c` at line 409.
-  The stack buffer overflow is located in stack of thread T0 at offset 2824 in frame `icalrecurrencetype_from_string` function.
- The fix involved copying the corrected version of code from upstream libical, effectively resolving the buffer overflow.
- The vulnerability was rated as "high" impact by Mozilla.
- The bug was fixed in Thunderbird 60.7.1 and corresponding versions in ESR and beta channels.
- The issue is related to libical, which is used by Thunderbird to process calendar data.
