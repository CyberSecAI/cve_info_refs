Bugzilla administrators manage [the list of keywords](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi). If you believe you need a new keyword, [please contact the administrators to discuss](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=bugzilla.mozilla.org&component=Administration).Mentors
Mentors are users who have offered to help the bug owner with such tasks as setting up a development environment, finding relevant information to fixing the bug, how to submit a patch for review, and finally how to get the fix committed.Needinfo
More information has been requested from specific individuals, or anyone, to move the bug forward to completion.OS
This is the operating system against which the bug was reported.Platform
This is the hardware platform against which the bug was reported (ARM, ARM64, x86, x86\_64, etc).Priority

| Priority | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | No decision |
| **P1** | Fix in the current release cycle |
| **P2** | Fix in the next release cycle or the following (nightly + 1 or nightly + 2) |
| **P3** | Backlog |
| **P4** | Do not use. This priority is for the Web Platform Test bot. |
| **P5** | Will not fix, but will accept a patch |

This field describes the importance and order in which a bug should be fixed compared to other bugs. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to prioritize the work to be done. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [priority definitions](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/priority.html), or for the main Bugzilla project, [Bugzilla:Priority\_System](/Bugzilla%3APriority_System "Bugzilla:Priority System").Product
Bugs are categorised into Products and Components. Select a Classification to narrow down this list.QA Contact
The person responsible for confirming this bug if it is unconfirmed, and for verifying the fix once the bug has been resolved.Rank
Used by some groups to provide finer-grained ordering for working on bugs than afforded by the Priority field. Use of this field is restricted to the `rank-setters` group.Regressed by
This bug has been introduced by the bugs listed here.Regressions
This bug has introduced the bugs listed here.Reporter
The person who filed this bug.See Also
This allows you to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations. You can enter a URL to a bug in the 'Add Bug URLs' field to note that that bug is related to this one. You can enter multiple URLs at once by separating them with a comma. You should normally use this field to refer to bugs in other bug tracker installations, or bugs which are related to, but not known to be duplicates of the bug. Bugs which are regressions should be listed in the Regressed by field (above)Severity
This field describes the impact of a bug. This field is utilized by the programmers/engineers/release managers/managers to determine the severity of issues and used as input for the priority of the bug. It should not be set by people filing bugs. See the Firefox [triage documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html) and [severity documentation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/severity.html).

| Severity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **--** | Default value for new bugs; bug triagers for components (ie engineers and other core project folks) are expected to update the bug's severity from this value. To avoid them missing new bugs for triage, do not alter this default when filing bugs. |
| **S1** | (Catastrophic) Blocks development/testing, may impact more than 25% of users, causes data loss, likely dot release driver, and no workaround available |
| **S2** | (Serious) Major functionality/product severely impaired or a high impact issue and a satisfactory workaround does not exist |
| **S3** | (Normal) Blocks non-critical functionality or a work around exists |
| **S4** | (Small/Trivial) minor significance, cosmetic issues, low or no impact to users |
| **N/A** | (Not Applicable) The above definitions do not apply to this bug; this value is reserved for bugs of type Task or Enhancement |

Summary
The bug summary is a short sentence which succinctly describes what the bug is about.Target Milestone
For Firefox-related bugs, when a change set (patch) lands in Mozilla-Central, the [sheriffs](/Sheriffing "Sheriffing") will set this field to the corresponding release value for the current Nightly.
Release status and tracking flags are used to mark intentions for when a fix or other patch should land.
If you need to track a bug against a set of milestones other than upcoming versions of Firefox, please tell the Bugzilla team, you may want a custom status flag.Triage Owner
User that is responsible [for triaging bugs in a specific component](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/policies/triage-bugzilla.html).Type
This field describes the [type of a bug](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/bug-mgmt/guides/bug-types.html).

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **defect** | regression, crash, hang, security vulnerability and any other general issue. |
| **enhancement** | new feature, improvement in UI, performance, etc. and any other request for user-facing changes and enhancements in the product; not engineering changes |
| **task** | refactoring, removal, replacement, enabling or disabling of functionality and any other engineering task |

URL
Bugs can have a URL associated with them - for example, a pointer to a web site where the problem is seen.Version
The version field defines the version of the software the bug was found in.Votes
Some bugs can be voted for, and you can limit your search to bugs with more than a certain number of votes. Votes are not used by Mozilla developers to set priorities.Whiteboard
Each bug has a free-form single line text entry box for adding tags and status information

Attached file
[stack-overflow-submit.eml](attachment.cgi?id=9067023)
â€” [Details](attachment.cgi?id=9067023&action=edit)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86\_64; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0

Steps to reproduce:

Open the attached saved message (stack-overflow-submit.eml) in Thunderbird. Receiving this message in my inbox also triggers the bug without further user interaction. The thunderbird process is killed.

Actual results:

A stack buffer overflow happens when loading the attached file. An specially crafted text/calendar mail attachment triggers a stack buffer overflow write in icalrecur\_add\_bydayrules.

$ thunderbird stack-overflow-submit.eml

Ignoring the poor formatting in that function, I've copied [the affected part from upstream](https://github.com/libical/libical/blob/master/src/libical/icalrecur.c#L533).

Can you keep the poor formatting from upstream? This might make it easier to upgrade and see the differences when we import a newer libical version. Also, it seems the commit that added that has a bunch of other changes, can you check if we can import the whole changeset instead?

The poor formatting isn't from upstream, it's ours. Upstream has tidied up.

The commit from upstream is +213 lines, -101 lines. I get that you want to stay vaguely in sync, but we're so far behind it's ridiculous.
