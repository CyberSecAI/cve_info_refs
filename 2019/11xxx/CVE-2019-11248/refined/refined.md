    "CVE-2019-11248": {
      "root_cause": "The debugging endpoint `/debug/pprof` is exposed over the unauthenticated Kubelet healthz port.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Exposure of the `/debug/pprof` endpoint on the unauthenticated Kubelet healthz port.",

        "Kubelet exposing unauthenticated healthz endpoints on port :10248."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could potentially leak sensitive information such as internal Kubelet memory addresses and configuration, or cause limited denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": "An attacker could access the exposed `/debug/pprof` endpoint through the unauthenticated Kubelet healthz port if the `healthzBindAddress` is set to a non-local address. With default local address, attack possible from pods or processes running in the host network namespace.",
      "required_capabilities": "Attacker requires network access to the Kubelet healthz port, or ability to run a pod or process within the host network namespace if default address is used. If non-default `healthzBindAddress` is used, external network access may be sufficient."
