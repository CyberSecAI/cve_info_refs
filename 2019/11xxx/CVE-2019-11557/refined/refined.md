Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the `contact_form_maker_ajax` function in the WDContactFormBuilder WordPress plugin handles AJAX actions. It dynamically loads a file based on the `$_GET['action']` or `$_POST['action']` parameters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The plugin doesn't properly sanitize the `$_GET['action']` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject directory traversal sequences (e.g., `/../../../../../../index`) to load arbitrary files from the server.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The vulnerability can be exploited through CSRF, as an attacker can craft a malicious form that tricks a logged-in administrator into sending the malicious AJAX request.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The plugin lacks input validation on the `$_GET['action']` parameter, enabling the LFI vulnerability.
*   **AJAX Action Definition Logic:** The way WordPress defines AJAX actions, combined with the plugin's implementation, enables an attacker to specify the plugin action in `$_GET['action']` while defining AJAX action in `$_POST['action']`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local File Inclusion:** An attacker can read sensitive files from the server's filesystem, potentially including configuration files, application source code, or other sensitive data.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can be a stepping stone for further attacks by exposing valuable information about the application or the hosting environment.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **CSRF Attack:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTML form that is submitted by a logged-in WordPress administrator.
*   **HTTP GET Parameter Manipulation:** The `$_GET['action']` parameter of the `admin-ajax.php` endpoint is manipulated to include directory traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in WordPress administrator to submit the malicious form (CSRF).
*   No specific user role is required to trigger the vulnerability, however the attack needs to target a logged-in user.
*   The attacker does not need direct access to the server or the application files.

**Additional Notes**
*   The plugin was closed due to the security issue.
*   The vulnerability was present in version 1.0.67 and potentially earlier versions.
*   The proof of concept (PoC) provided demonstrates the vulnerability using an HTML form and directory traversal.
*  The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2019-11557.
