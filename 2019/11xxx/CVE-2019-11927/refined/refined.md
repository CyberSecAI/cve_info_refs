- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Integer overflow when parsing EXIF tags in WEBP images.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Integer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds write on the heap.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attacker can perform an out-of-bounds write on the heap, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specially crafted WEBP image with malicious EXIF tags.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious WEBP image to a vulnerable WhatsApp user.
