Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2019-11574 Analysis**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied URLs when fetching remote avatars in Simple Machines Forum (SMF). Specifically, the application doesn't validate user-provided URLs used when fetching remote profile pictures which are passed to cURL requests.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is SSRF, which allows an attacker to force the server to make HTTP requests to arbitrary locations.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence of input sanitization on user-supplied URLs. This allows an attacker to specify any URL, including internal network addresses, potentially leading to exploitation.
    *   **Bypassing Redirect Limitation:** While the upcoming alpha version (2.1x) attempts to limit redirects, it can be bypassed by a crafted response that causes the script to increment the redirect counter. This allows for a total of 3 redirects.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Server-Side Code Execution:** In some instances, the SSRF vulnerability can be leveraged to gain remote code execution on the server. This occurs if an attacker can target an internal service or a vulnerable endpoint that can be exploited via HTTP requests.
    *   **Cross-Site Port Attack (XSPA):**  The SSRF can be used to perform port scanning and identify services running on the server or the internal network.
    *   **Probing Internal Services:** Attackers can probe internal services that are not directly accessible from the internet.
    *   **Local File Disclosure (LFD):** In specific scenarios, SSRF can potentially lead to the disclosure of local files if the targeted internal service permits that.
    *   **General SSRF Risks:** The vulnerability exposes the application to common risks associated with SSRF. This includes unauthorized access to internal resources.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Remote Avatar Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through the input fields for remote avatars where users can specify a URL to fetch their profile picture from.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a user who can access and modify their profile settings including their avatar. The attacker does not need elevated privileges but does need a user account.
    *  **Ability to Specify URL:** The attacker needs to be able to specify the URL for a remote avatar.

**Additional Notes**

*   The content mentions that the current version of SMF has no sanitization.
*   The upcoming Alpha release (2.1x) has extra protections by checking for ports when using fsockopen, but it falls back to cURL if that fails. This is still vulnerable due to no port checks with cURL usage.
*   The redirect limitation of 0 is bypassed using a crafted response that forces the script to repeat the request using a +1 increment in redirection level with a maximum of 3 redirects.

**In summary,** the vulnerability is a classic SSRF due to a lack of input sanitization, which could potentially lead to RCE, XSPA, LFD, and internal service probing. The attacker leverages the remote avatar feature, and the weakness is present in both the current and upcoming SMF versions with some mitigation bypassable in the upcoming version.
