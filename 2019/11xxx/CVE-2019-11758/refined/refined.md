  "CVE-2019-11758": {
    "Description": "Mozilla community member Philipp reported a memory safety bug present in Firefox 68 when 360 Total Security was installed. This bug showed evidence of memory corruption in the accessibility engine and we presume that with enough effort that it could be exploited to run arbitrary code.",
    "Root cause": "Memory corruption in the accessibility engine due to interference from 360 Total Security.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Memory corruption",
      "Use-after-free",
      "Wild pointer"
    ],
    "Impact": "Potentially exploitable crash, arbitrary code execution",
     "Attack vectors": [
       "Third party DLL injection into the Firefox process."
     ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to install the vulnerable third party software (360 Total Security) and have it inject a DLL into the Firefox process. The attacker can also exploit the vulnerability by using a similar method.",
    "Additional Information": "The vulnerability is triggered when a content process notifies the parent process that an accessible object has been removed. The parent process crashes while trying to remove the inaccessible from its parent. The vulnerability is associated with the DLL safemon64.dll."
