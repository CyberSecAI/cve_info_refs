The provided content is related to CVE-2019-11887.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A library component in a framework used by SimplyBook.me was not working as expected, causing a security hole.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a security hole in a framework library component. This allowed for potential access to user account data. Specifically, the vulnerability was present on servers hosting European and Asian user accounts (domains ending in .asia or .it).

**Impact of exploitation:**
If exploited, a malicious hacker could potentially access account data of users residing on the same server, including:
  - Name, unique identifier, picture, OpenID
  - Email address, phone number, physical address

  - Salted hash of passwords
  - Medical and health information (excluding the fully encrypted new SOAP module)
  - Payments history, services and products price

  - SimplyBook.me account data, payment system keys, SMTP username/password, gallery (logo, background, catalog, promotions), connected Google/Outlook calendars.
  
**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector was a vulnerability in a framework library component, that could be potentially exploited by an attacker on the same server as the target user.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker would need to be a skilled hacker and also have an account on the same server as the targeted account(s). This means they would need an account with SimplyBook.me in order to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

- Credit card details are not affected because they are not processed on the web site.
- The vulnerability was discovered by a security expert, not internally.
- The vulnerability was present in part of their servers, affecting .asia and .it domains.
- Code was updated, and additional measures were taken to prevent the error and limit file uploads/execution.
- Server passwords and keys were changed.
- Server logs were inspected and no traces of exploitation were found.
