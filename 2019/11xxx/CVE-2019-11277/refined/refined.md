Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2019-11277:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an LDAP injection vulnerability within the Cloud Foundry NFS Volume Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an LDAP injection flaw. This means that user-supplied input used in the creation of service instances is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary LDAP filters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful LDAP injection could allow a malicious space developer to:

*   **Deny service:** By injecting crafted LDAP filters, the attacker could disrupt the normal operation of the LDAP service.
*   **Perform a dictionary attack:** The attacker could potentially use injected filters to enumerate or retrieve information from the LDAP directory by manipulating search filters

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the creation of service instances. A remote, authenticated space developer can inject malicious LDAP filters during this process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an authenticated space developer within the Cloud Foundry environment.
*   The attacker must have the ability to create service instances.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

*   **CF Deployment:** All versions prior to v11.1.0.
*   **CF NFS volume release:**
    *   1.7 versions prior to v1.7.11.
    *   2.x versions prior to v2.3.0.

**Mitigation:**
The recommended mitigation is to upgrade the affected products to the following versions:

*   **CF Deployment:** Upgrade to v11.1.0 or greater.
*   **CF NFS volume release:**
    *   Upgrade 1.7 versions to v1.7.11 or greater.
    *   Upgrade 2.x versions to v2.3.0 or greater.
