Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11272:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of `PlaintextPasswordEncoder` in Spring Security, which, when used with a `null` encoded password, allows authentication with the password "null".

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper handling of null encoded passwords when using `PlaintextPasswordEncoder`.
- The system incorrectly authenticates a user with a password of "null" when their stored encoded password is `null`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain unauthorized access to user accounts with a `null` encoded password.
- This vulnerability potentially grants full access to the compromised account and related resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based: an attacker sends an authentication request with the password "null".

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to know that the system uses `PlaintextPasswordEncoder`.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of user accounts with `null` encoded passwords.
- Network access to the system is required to send authentication requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Spring Security versions 4.2.x up to 4.2.12 and older unsupported versions.
- Spring Security 5+ is not impacted.
- The fix involves upgrading to Spring Security 4.2.13 or a supported branch for older versions.
- The vulnerability was identified by Tim BÃ¼the and Daniel Neagaru from mytaxi.
- Debian LTS has issued a security update for `libspring-security-2.0-java` to address this issue, upgrading the package to version `2.0.7.RELEASE-3+deb8u2`.
