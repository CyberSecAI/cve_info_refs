Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The AUO Solar Data Recorder web interface allows modification of system settings via the `/protect/config.htm` page. It fails to sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `addr` parameter, before storing it in a database.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized user input, which is later rendered in a web page. This allows the attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when a user views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser session. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, including:
    - Session hijacking: Stealing cookies to impersonate the user.
    - Phishing: Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    - Defacement: Modifying the appearance of the web page.
    - Information theft: Accessing sensitive information available in the browser.
    - Further attacks: Launching other attacks using the compromised session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is performed over the web interface.
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/protect/config.htm` endpoint.
- The malicious payload is injected within the `addr` parameter of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the AUO Solar Data Recorder web interface.
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned as required, implying any user with access to the interface can perform the attack.

**Technical Details**
The vulnerability is triggered by sending a POST request with the following data:
`addr="<script>alert(123)</script>&dhcp=1` to `http://<Your Modem IP>/protect/config.htm`

This injects the `<script>alert(123)</script>` payload into the database which will then be executed when the data is rendered on a web page by the application.
