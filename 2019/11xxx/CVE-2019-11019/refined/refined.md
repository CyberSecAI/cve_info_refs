- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of authentication in the case-exporting components.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for accessing case details, allowing unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote attackers can access all claim details, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** By visiting guessable URLs such as `exportpdf/all_claim_detail.php?claim_id=`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No authentication is required, allowing remote access.
