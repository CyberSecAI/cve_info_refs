State:
Open

Summary:
Cross-site Scripting vulnerability in CMS Made Simple

Detailed Description:
```
Hello sir/madam!

I was able to discover a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in CMS Made
Simple File Manager.

When you go to "File Manager" under the "Content" section in CMS Made Simple
Admin Console, you will be able to see the files in the CMS. Now, you have to
select one of the files and click on the "Rename" button.

When it shows the "New name::" field, you need to type:
"onmouseover=alert(document.domain)//

Now, when you click on the "Rename" button to save the changes, the page will
reload and when you put your mouse pointer over the input field, it will execute
the XSS payload.

This cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the latest version of CMS Made
Simple (2.2.10) and all versions below it.

I hope you would fix this vulnerability in the future versions of CMS Made
Simple as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Binit Ghimire
```
