- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in the File Manager of CMS Made Simple. The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when renaming a file.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability due to improper sanitization of user-provided input in the file renaming functionality.

-  **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they interact with the vulnerable file rename field by hovering their mouse. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirecting the user to a malicious website, potentially compromising the user's account and data.

- **Attack vectors:**  The attacker needs to access the "File Manager" under the "Content" section in CMS Made Simple Admin Console. They then select a file and use the rename function. The XSS payload needs to be inserted into the 'New name::' input field.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have access to the admin panel of CMS Made Simple.
