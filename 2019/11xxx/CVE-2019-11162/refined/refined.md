Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient access control in the hardware abstraction within the SEMA driver of the Intel® Computing Improvement Program.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The core issue lies in inadequate access control mechanisms within the SEMA driver's hardware abstraction layer. This means that the driver does not properly restrict operations or data access based on the privileges of the user or process making the request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Escalation of Privilege:** An attacker could leverage the vulnerability to gain higher privileges than they should normally have, potentially leading to full system control.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could render the system or specific services unusable by causing crashes or resource exhaustion.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data might be exposed to unauthorized access due to the lack of proper access controls.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the system to exploit this vulnerability. This implies that a user who already has some degree of access to the target machine can potentially elevate their privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system. The vulnerability cannot be exploited by unauthenticated users remotely.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the machine.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the Intel® Computing Improvement Program before version 2.4.0.04733.
*   The fix is to update to the latest version of the Intel® Computing Improvement Program, which is version 2.4.10910.
*   The vulnerability is rated as HIGH severity with a CVSS base score of 8.2.
*   The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H. This translates to:
    *   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *  **UI:R** (User interaction: Required)
    *   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    *   **I:H** (Integrity Impact: High)
    *   **A:H** (Availability Impact: High)
