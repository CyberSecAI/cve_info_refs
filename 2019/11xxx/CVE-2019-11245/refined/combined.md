## Description

![@sherbang](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/275015?v=4&size=48)[sherbang](https://github.com/sherbang)opened [on May 24, 2019](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/78308#issue-448249782)

[CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L), 4.9 (medium)

In kubelet v1.13.6 and v1.14.2, containers for pods that do not specify an explicit `runAsUser` attempt to run as uid 0 (root) on container restart, or if the image was previously pulled to the node. If the pod specified `mustRunAsNonRoot: true`, the kubelet will refuse to start the container as root. If the pod did not specify `mustRunAsNonRoot: true`, the kubelet will run the container as uid 0.

[CVE-2019-11245](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r76g-g87f-vw8f "CVE-2019-11245") will be **fixed** in the following Kubernetes releases:

* v1.13.7 in [Revert "Use consistent imageRef during container startup" #78320](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78320)
* v1.14.3 in [Revert "Use consistent imageRef during container startup" #78316](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78316)

Fixed by [#78261](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/78261) in master

### Affected components:

* Kubelet

### Affected versions:

* Kubelet v1.13.6
* Kubelet v1.14.2

### Affected configurations:

Clusters with:

* Kubelet versions v1.13.6 or v1.14.2
* Pods that do not specify an explicit `runAsUser: <uid>` or `mustRunAsNonRoot:true`

### Impact:

If a pod is run without any user controls specified in the pod spec (like `runAsUser: <uid>` or `mustRunAsNonRoot:true`), a container in that pod that would normally run as the USER specified in the container image manifest can sometimes be run as root instead (on container restart, or if the image was previously pulled to the node)

* pods that specify an explicit `runAsUser` are unaffected and continue to work properly
* podSecurityPolicies that force a `runAsUser` setting are unaffected and continue to work properly
* pods that specify `mustRunAsNonRoot:true` will refuse to start the container as uid 0, which can affect availability
* pods that do not specify `runAsUser` or `mustRunAsNonRoot:true` will run as uid 0 on restart or if the image was previously pulled to the node

### Mitigations:

This section lists possible mitigations to use prior to upgrading.

* Specify `runAsUser` directives in pods to control the uid a container runs as
* Specify `mustRunAsNonRoot:true` directives in pods to prevent starting as root (note this means the attempt to start the container will fail on affected kubelet versions)
* Downgrade kubelets to v1.14.1 or v1.13.5 as instructed by your Kubernetes distribution.

**original issue description follows**

**What happened**:

When I launch a pod from a docker image that specifies a USER in the Dockerfile, the container only runs as that user on its first launch. After that the container runs as UID=0.

**What you expected to happen**:

I expect the container to act consistently every launch, and probably with the USER specified in the container.

**How to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible)**:

Testing with minikube (same test specifying v1.14.1, `kubectl logs test` always returns 11211):

```
$ minikube start --kubernetes-version v1.14.2

$ kubectl apply -f test.yaml

# as soon as pod starts
$ kubectl logs test

# Wait 30 seconds for container to restart
$ kubectl logs test
0
# Try deleting/recreating the pod
$ kubectl delete pod test
pod "test" deleted
$ kubectl apply -f test.yaml
pod/test created
$ kubectl logs test
0

```

**Anything else we need to know?**:

**Environment**:

* Kubernetes version (use `kubectl version`): I get the results I expect in v1.13.5 and v1.14.1. The problem exists in v1.13.6 and v1.14.2
* Cloud provider or hardware configuration: minikube v1.1.0 using VirtualBox
* OS (e.g: `cat /etc/os-release`):
* Kernel (e.g. `uname -a`):
* Install tools:
* Network plugin and version (if this is a network-related bug):
* Others:

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
