Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how the kubelet handles the user ID of containers. Specifically, when a pod doesn't explicitly specify a `runAsUser` or `mustRunAsNonRoot` directive, the kubelet sometimes fails to consistently run the container with the user specified in the container image manifest. Instead, on container restart or if the image was previously pulled to the node, it attempts to run the container as uid 0 (root), even if the image's manifest specifies a different user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Privilege Assignment:** The kubelet incorrectly assigns the user ID to containers, defaulting to root (uid 0) in certain scenarios instead of respecting the user specified in the container image manifest.
*   **Inconsistency:** The container runs as the image specified user on first launch only. Subsequent restarts or if the image was previously pulled to the node cause it to run as root.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** If a container image is designed to run as a non-root user, this vulnerability could lead to the container running as root, potentially giving the container more access within the node than intended.
*   **Security Policy Bypass:** If a pod or deployment relies on the container to be run as a non-root user, it can bypass security policies unless `mustRunAsNonRoot: true` is set in the pod spec.
*   **Availability Issues:** Pods with `mustRunAsNonRoot: true` will fail to start due to kubelet refusing to start the container as root, leading to availability issues.
*   **Loss of Integrity and Confidentiality:** According to NetApp's advisory the vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Container Restart:**  Restarting a container in a pod that does not specify runAsUser can trigger the issue.
*   **Pre-Pulled Image:** If the container image was already present on the node, the vulnerability is triggered, causing a new container instance to run as root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to create or modify pods in the Kubernetes cluster.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the same node where the pod runs, the vulnerability is triggered by actions performed by the Kubelet on the worker node.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Kubelet versions v1.13.6 and v1.14.2 are specifically mentioned as vulnerable.
*   **Mitigations:**
    *   Specify `runAsUser` directives in pod specs.
    *   Specify `mustRunAsNonRoot:true` directives in pod specs.
    *   Downgrade kubelets to v1.14.1 or v1.13.5 (or prior).
*   **Fixes:** The vulnerability is fixed in Kubernetes versions v1.13.7 and v1.14.3.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 4.9 (Medium) from the Github advisory and 7.8 (High) from NetApp. The GitHub advisory provides a CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L score, while NetApp reports CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
