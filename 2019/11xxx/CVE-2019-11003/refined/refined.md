The provided content relates to a potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Materialize CSS library, which is highly relevant to the general nature of CVE-2019-11003. However, the provided information does not state the official CVE description and should be verified against official sources.

Here's a breakdown of the extracted information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Materialize CSS library, by default, uses `innerHTML` or `$.html()` to inject dynamic content into Toasts, Tooltips, and Autocomplete components. This allows for the execution of HTML and JavaScript code provided by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code through user-controlled data, which will then be executed within the context of the application using Materialize CSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking (stealing cookies)
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites
    *   Modifying the content of the page
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user
    *   Data theft
    *   Defacement
* The specific example given in the report demonstrates how an attacker could steal session cookies via `document.cookie`.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-supplied Data:** The primary attack vector is through user-supplied data that is displayed using the vulnerable components. This could include:
    *   Data in form fields, server responses, or other user inputs.
    *   Any data passed into the `html` option for Toasts or the `data-tooltip` attribute for Tooltips, or the `data` for Autocomplete.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the data that is used by the vulnerable components.
*   The attacker needs to be able to cause this content to be displayed to a victim. This could be through direct interaction with an application or through a stored attack.
*   No specific privilege is needed, just the capability to inject user-controlled data.

**Technical Details:**

*   The issue is demonstrated with code snippets for each vulnerable component (Toast, Tooltips, and Autocomplete) using example HTML injection payloads that call `javascript:alert(document.cookie)`.
*   The report suggests sanitizing the HTML by default or offering a configuration parameter to allow unsafe HTML.

**Additional Notes**

*   The reporter explicitly mentions that this behavior is present in versions `0.100.2` and `1.0.0`
*   The reporter recognizes the need to validate user-provided data, but this flaw highlights the importance of safe defaults in libraries to protect developers.
