| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=551162#c0)  Roger Light [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-17 08:11:06 EDT  ``` If an MQTT v5 client connects to Mosquitto, sets a last will and testament, sets a will delay interval, sets a session expiry interval, and the will delay interval is set longer than the session expiry interval, then a use after free error occurs, which has the potential to cause a crash in some situations.  CWE-416: Use After Free  Affects versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.4 inclusive. Fixed in 1.6.5.  <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L/E:F/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1>  This has already been disclosed. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=551162#c1)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-17 16:15:18 EDT  ``` Pull request: <https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/pull/2556> ``` |  |
