{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an unspecified flaw related to the handling of parameters in the PRTG Network Monitor software. Specifically, the vulnerability is triggered during the execution of 'HttpAdvancedSensor.exe' when processing the `proxyport_` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of user input",
      "Command injection via parameter manipulation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker with read-write privileges can execute arbitrary code and OS commands with system privileges. This is achieved by overriding the 'writeresult' command-line parameter for the HttpAdvancedSensor.exe executable, allowing for arbitrary file writes, which can then lead to code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Specially crafted HTTP requests",
	  "Manipulating the `proxyport_` parameter"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be authenticated with read-write privileges to modify sensor settings and trigger the vulnerable code path."
  },
  "additional_notes": "The provided content includes information on the discovery of CVE-2019-11073 and CVE-2019-11074, which are mentioned as being found along the way when researching CVE-2018-19204. However, no specific details about CVE-2019-11073 is provided other than its existence"
