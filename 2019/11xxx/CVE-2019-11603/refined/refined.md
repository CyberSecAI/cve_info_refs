- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to insufficient path validation when processing HTTP requests, which allows an attacker to access files outside the intended HTTP root directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can read files from the file system that are outside of the intended http root directory.
- **Attack vectors**: Network based, sending crafted HTTP requests
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected device. No authentication is needed.
