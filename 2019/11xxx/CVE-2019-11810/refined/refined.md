{
  "CVE-2019-11810": {
    "Root cause": "A NULL pointer dereference can occur when `megasas_create_frame_pool()` fails in `megasas_alloc_cmds()` within the Linux kernel's `drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c`.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "NULL pointer dereference",
       "use-after-free"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of Service (system crash)",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access",
      "Maliciously crafted I/O request"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with the ability to load the `megaraid_sas` kernel module and groom memory beforehand is required. The timing window for a hardware attack is minimal."
  },
  "CVE-2019-13631": {
     "Root cause": "A malicious USB device sends a specially crafted HID report that leads to an out-of-bounds write during the generation of debug messages in the `parse_hid_report_descriptor` function in `drivers/input/tablet/gtco.c` of the Linux Kernel.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds write"
    ],
     "Impact": "Denial of service.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Physical proximity",
        "Maliciously crafted USB device"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker with physical proximity and control of the USB device."
  },
   "CVE-2019-1125": {
    "Root cause": "A vulnerability exists when certain central processing units (CPU) speculatively access memory. This is a variant of the Spectre Variant 1 speculative execution side channel vulnerability.",
     "Weaknesses": [
      "Speculative execution side channel"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could read privileged data across trust boundaries.",
    "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access",
        "Speculatively access memory"
      ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a specially crafted application. The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights directly, but it could be used to obtain information that could be used to try to compromise the affected system further."
  },
    "CVE-2018-18281": {
    "Root cause": "Since Linux kernel version 3.2, the mremap() syscall performs TLB flushes after dropping pagetable locks. If a syscall such as ftruncate() removes entries from the pagetables of a task that is in the middle of mremap(), a stale TLB entry can remain for a short time that permits access to a physical page after it has been released back to the page allocator and reused.",
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Time-of-check time-of-use vulnerability",
      "Stale TLB entry"
    ],
    "Impact": "A local attacker could gain access to a freed page after it is reused.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Local access"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "A local attacker with the ability to trigger a race condition between the mremap and ftruncate syscalls."
