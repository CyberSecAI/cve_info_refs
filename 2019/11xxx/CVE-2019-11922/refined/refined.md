Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11922:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content confirms that this CVE is related to a vulnerability in the zstd library. The official description states: "A race condition in the one-pass compression functions of Zstandard prior to version 1.3.8 could allow an attacker to write bytes out of bounds if an output buffer smaller than the recommended size was used." The bug reports, mailing list announcements, and the github commit all reference a fix for this out-of-bounds write vulnerability, therefore, this content is RELATED to CVE-2019-11922.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a race condition within the one-pass compression functions of the zstd library. Specifically, if a provided output buffer is smaller than the recommended size, the library fails to correctly prevent out-of-bounds write.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists in the logic handling output buffer size during one-pass compression. This means that under certain conditions related to timing/concurrency an out-of-bounds write can happen.
    *   **Out-of-bounds Write:** When the output buffer is smaller than recommended, the race condition leads to writing data beyond the allocated space, potentially corrupting memory.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Successful exploitation results in an out-of-bounds write, which can corrupt memory.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** As stated in the Ubuntu notice "An attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code." Memory corruption can lead to arbitrary code execution if controlled by the attacker.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Memory corruption can also lead to program crashes causing denial of service.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Specially Crafted Input:** An attacker provides specially crafted input to the vulnerable one-pass compression function, where the output buffer is smaller than expected.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to control the data being compressed and the size of the output buffer provided. No specific privilege or network location seems required, making this remotely exploitable.

**3. Additional details from content:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in zstd version 1.3.8 and later.
*   Patches and updates were released by various distributions, including openSUSE and Ubuntu, to address the vulnerability.
*   The fix includes changes to correctly handle output buffer size checks and prevent out-of-bounds writes when performing one-pass compressions.

**4. Technical details:**

*   The fix was implemented via the commit `3e5cdf1b6a85843e991d7d10f6a2567c15580da0` on Github, fixing `T36302429`
*   The `ZSTD_encodeSequences_body` function had a missing size check
*   A check was added in `fuzzer.c` to test that compression into a buffer that is too small correctly returns an error, without writing out-of-bounds.

**5. Summary of relevant content:**

The vulnerability is a race condition leading to an out-of-bounds write in the zstd compression library, specifically in the one-pass compression routines. Attackers can trigger this vulnerability by providing specially crafted input, where the output buffer is smaller than the recommended size. This can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution. Patches have been released and include checks that should prevent the out-of-bounds write.
