| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c0)  Fabian Vogt   2018-02-22 15:09:41 UTC  ``` Certain licenses require that license files must be shipped together with the binaries in all cases.  By using the %doc marker, this is no longer guaranteed (e.g. by enabling excludedocs).  Thus it is important that for such cases, %license is used instead of %doc. The effect is that the file is always installed, stored in a different directory (/usr/share/licenses/<pkg>/) and can be queried using rpm (e.g. "rpm -qL kernel-firmware"). ``` [Comment

Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but any other files that may not be essential for the functionality?  That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

I have no problem whatsoever with excludedocs meaning that files tagged as %doc are not installed.  I have a problem with excludedocs being used in a way that breaks the existing intention and usage of the %doc tag in spec files. Whoever thought that using excludedocs to strip packages for inclusion in containers was a good idea was evidently wrong about that, as it required the introduction of the %license tag, so that there are now two useless tags: Not only can %doc no longer be used to simply mark up documentation files as intended because it's being subverted to mean something it did not do before, but the only reason %license exists is as a hack to work around the previously mentioned hack. ``` [Comment 199](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c199)  Fabian Vogt   2019-09-18 12:13:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #198](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c198)) > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #197](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c197)) > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #196](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c196)) > > > Is it too late to object to this change, which is completely misguided? > > >  > > > Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of > > > "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about > > > adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so > > > that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but > > > any other files that may not be essential for the functionality? > >  > > That's what optional subpackages are for though. > >  > > > That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, > > > and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

Please read up on what %license means and does.  This is the document I read:  <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Use_license_macro_in_RPMs_for_packages_in_Cloud_Image>  >Use new %license macro to separate license files from documentation, so the latter can be excluded from container images without stripping license information which must be included.  I may be mistaken in saying that this was the original intention of the %license directive. In that case, instead of just the %doc directive being repurposed for reducing the size of cloud images, the same applies to %license. Though I find the license violation argument to smell of post-hoc reasoning after the idea of using nodocs to reduce the installation size was raised, of course I am not a lawyer.

That's not the only reason for %license though, it also allows to query the individual license files of packages and to ensure that every package ships its license file. Without %license that is not possible. ``` [Comment 202](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c202)  Kristoffer Gronlund   2019-09-18 13:26:28 UTC  ``` (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #201](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c201)) > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #200](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c200)) > > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #199](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c199)) > > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #198](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c198)) > > > > (In reply to Fabian Vogt from [comment #197](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c197)) > > > > > (In reply to Kristoffer Gronlund from [comment #196](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c196)) > > > > > > Is it too late to object to this change, which is completely misguided? > > > > > >  > > > > > > Instead of breaking every single package by changing the meaning of > > > > > > "excludedocs" to mean "let me strip these files from the package", how about > > > > > > adding support for tagging files in an rpm as strippable or optional, so > > > > > > that not only documentation can be dropped when space is at a premium, but > > > > > > any other files that may not be essential for the functionality? > > > > >  > > > > > That's what optional subpackages are for though. > > > > >  > > > > > > That way, every single package would still be OK even without any markup, > > > > > > and packages can be updated to mark files as optional over time.

(at least, that is what it looks like to me). If the goal is to reduce the size of packages, I would prefer if that was done explicitly via directives introduced for that specific purpose.  But sure, I'll give this meaningless crusade up and concede that %license has a legitimate use on its own. ;) ``` [Comment 206](show_bug.cgi?id=1082318#c206)  Swamp Workflow Management   2019-10-02 16:11:55 UTC  ``` SUSE-SU-2019:2517-1: An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes is now available.

\* build: Fix MinGW-W64 build by @myzhang1029 (#1600)
\* misc: Expand decodecorpus coverage by @ephiepark (#1664)
- Add baselibs.conf: libarchive gained zstd support and provides
-32bit libraries. This means, zstd also needs to provide -32bit libs.
- Update to new upstream release 1.4.0
\* perf: level 1 compression speed was improved
\* cli: added --[no-]compress-literals flag to enable or disable literal
compression
- Reword "real-time" in description by some actual statistics, because
603MB/s (lowest zstd level) is not "real-time" for quite some
applications.
- zstd 1.3.8:
\* better decompression speed on large files (+7%) and cold dictionaries
(+15%)
\* slightly better compression ratio at high compression modes
\* new --rsyncable mode
\* support decompression of empty frames into NULL (used to be an error)
\* support ZSTD\_CLEVEL environment variable
\* --no-progress flag, preserving final summary
\* various CLI fixes
\* fix race condition in one-pass compression functions that could allow
out of bounds write (CVE-2019-11922, boo#1142941)
- zstd 1.3.7:
\* fix ratio for dictionary compression at levels 9 and 10
\* add man pages for zstdless and zstdgrep
- includes changes from zstd 1.3.6:
\* faster dictionary builder, also the new default for --train
\* previous (slower, slightly higher quality) dictionary builder to be
selected via --train-cover
\* Faster dictionary decompression and compression under memory limits
with many dictionaries used simultaneously
\* New command --adapt for compressed network piping of data adjusted to
the perceived network conditions
- update to 1.3.5:
\* much faster dictionary compression
\* small quality improvement for dictionary generation
\* slightly improved performance at high compression levels
\* automatic memory release for long duration contexts
\* fix overlapLog can be manually set
\* fix decoding invalid lz4 frames
\* fix performance degradation for dictionary compression when using
advanced API
- fix pzstd tests
- enable pzstd (parallel zstd)
- Use %license instead of %doc [boo#1082318]
- Add disk \_constraints to fix ppc64le build
- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library
(boo#1133297).

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2020

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

Starting with the October 2020 Critical Patch Update, Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components which are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix. Oracle has published two versions of the October 2020 Critical Patch Update Advisory: this version of the advisory implemented the change in how non-exploitable vulnerabilities in third-party components are reported, and the “traditional” advisory follows the same format as the previous advisories. The “traditional” advisory is published at <https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020traditional.html>.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 403 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2020 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2712240.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2020verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

An update that solves one vulnerability and has two fixes
is now available.
Description:
This update for zstd fixes the following issues:
- Update to version 1.4.2:
\* bug: Fix bug in zstd-0.5 decoder by @terrelln (#1696)
\* bug: Fix seekable decompression in-memory API by @iburinoc (#1695)
\* bug: Close minor memory leak in CLI by @LeeYoung624 (#1701)
\* misc: Validate blocks are smaller than size limit by @vivekmig (#1685)
\* misc: Restructure source files by @ephiepark (#1679)
- Update to version 1.4.1:
\* bug: Fix data corruption in niche use cases by @terrelln (#1659)
\* bug: Fuzz legacy modes, fix uncovered bugs by @terrelln (#1593, #1594,
#1595)
\* bug: Fix out of bounds read by @terrelln (#1590)
\* perf: Improve decode speed by ~7% @mgrice (#1668)
\* perf: Slightly improved compression ratio of level 3 and 4
(ZSTD\_dfast) by @cyan4973 (#1681)
\* perf: Slightly faster compression speed when re-using a context by
@cyan4973 (#1658)
\* perf: Improve compression ratio for small windowLog by @cyan4973
(#1624)
\* perf: Faster compression speed in high compression mode for repetitive
data by @terrelln (#1635)
\* api: Add parameter to generate smaller dictionaries by @tyler-tran
(#1656)
\* cli: Recognize symlinks when built in C99 mode by @felixhandte (#1640)
\* cli: Expose cpu load indicator for each file on -vv mode by @ephiepark
(#1631)
\* cli: Restrict read permissions on destination files by @chungy (#1644)
\* cli: zstdgrep: handle -f flag by @felixhandte (#1618)
\* cli: zstdcat: follow symlinks by @vejnar (#1604)
\* doc: Remove extra size limit on compressed blocks by @felixhandte
(#1689)
\* doc: Fix typo by @yk-tanigawa (#1633)
\* doc: Improve documentation on streaming buffer sizes by @cyan4973
(#1629)
\* build: CMake: support building with LZ4 @leeyoung624 (#1626)
\* build: CMake: install zstdless and zstdgrep by @leeyoung624 (#1647)
\* build: CMake: respect existing uninstall target by @j301scott (#1619)
\* build: Make: skip multithread tests when built without support by
@michaelforney (#1620)
\* build: Make: Fix examples/ test target by @sjnam (#1603)
\* build: Meson: rename options out of deprecated namespace by @lzutao
(#1665)
\* build: Meson: fix build by @lzutao (#1602)
\* build: Visual Studio: don't export symbols in static lib by @scharan
(#1650)
\* build: Visual Studio: fix linking by @absotively (#1639)
\* build: Fix MinGW-W64 build by @myzhang1029 (#1600)
\* misc: Expand decodecorpus coverage by @ephiepark (#1664)
- Add baselibs.conf: libarchive gained zstd support and provides
-32bit libraries. This means, zstd also needs to provide -32bit libs.
- Update to new upstream release 1.4.0
\* perf: level 1 compression speed was improved
\* cli: added --[no-]compress-literals flag to enable or disable literal
compression
- Reword "real-time" in description by some actual statistics, because
603MB/s (lowest zstd level) is not "real-time" for quite some
applications.
- zstd 1.3.8:
\* better decompression speed on large files (+7%) and cold dictionaries
(+15%)
\* slightly better compression ratio at high compression modes
\* new --rsyncable mode
\* support decompression of empty frames into NULL (used to be an error)
\* support ZSTD\_CLEVEL environment variable
\* --no-progress flag, preserving final summary
\* various CLI fixes
\* fix race condition in one-pass compression functions that could allow
out of bounds write (CVE-2019-11922, boo#1142941)
- zstd 1.3.7:
\* fix ratio for dictionary compression at levels 9 and 10
\* add man pages for zstdless and zstdgrep
- includes changes from zstd 1.3.6:
\* faster dictionary builder, also the new default for --train
\* previous (slower, slightly higher quality) dictionary builder to be
selected via --train-cover
\* Faster dictionary decompression and compression under memory limits
with many dictionaries used simultaneously
\* New command --adapt for compressed network piping of data adjusted to
the perceived network conditions
- update to 1.3.5:
\* much faster dictionary compression
\* small quality improvement for dictionary generation
\* slightly improved performance at high compression levels
\* automatic memory release for long duration contexts
\* fix overlapLog can be manually set
\* fix decoding invalid lz4 frames
\* fix performance degradation for dictionary compression when using
advanced API
- fix pzstd tests
- enable pzstd (parallel zstd)
- Use %license instead of %doc [boo#1082318]
- Add disk \_constraints to fix ppc64le build
- Use FAT LTO objects in order to provide proper static library
(boo#1133297).
