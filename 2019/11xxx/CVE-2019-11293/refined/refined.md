Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11293:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Cloud Foundry UAA (User Account and Authentication) component, when configured to log at DEBUG level, logs the client_secret credentials when they are passed as a query parameter in a request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Sensitive data exposure: The client_secret, which is a critical authentication credential, is written to log files.
- Debug logging configuration: Leaving debug logging enabled in a production environment.
- Query parameter handling:  UAA logs query parameters without sanitizing or omitting sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Disclosure of credentials: An attacker who has access to the uaa.log file (potentially a malicious authenticated user with access to logs) can obtain client_secret credentials. This could enable the attacker to impersonate or gain access to services that use those credentials.
- Potential for broader compromise: The compromised credentials can be used to access other resources protected by the UAA.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires an authenticated user (or anyone with log access) to have access to the UAA logs.
- The client\_secret must be passed as a query parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Access to the uaa.log file. This could be achieved if the attacker has compromised the underlying infrastructure or if the UAA logs are not sufficiently protected.
- The attacker must be able to induce UAA to log query parameters with DEBUG level enabled.
