Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2019-11934:

*   **Vulnerability:** Improper handling of `close_notify` alerts in `AsyncSSLSocket` can lead to an out-of-bounds read.
*   **Affected Software:** Facebook's Folly library.
*   **Affected Versions:** Folly versions prior to v2019.11.04.00.
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way `AsyncSSLSocket` handles `close_notify` alerts during SSL/TLS communication.
*   **Impact:** An out-of-bounds read can occur, potentially leading to information disclosure or other undefined behavior.
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Folly version v2019.11.04.00 or later.
*   **Fix:** The linked commit `c321eb588909646c15aefde035fd3133ba32cdee` in the Folly repository addresses this issue. The commit modifies `AsyncSSLSocket.cpp` to handle `close_notify` as a standard `writeErr`. Additionally, it adds a test case (`EarlyCloseNotify`) in `AsyncSSLSocketTest.cpp` to verify the fix.
