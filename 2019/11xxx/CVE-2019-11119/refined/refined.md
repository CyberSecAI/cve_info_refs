- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient session validation in the service API of IntelÂ® RAID Web Console 3.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of proper session validation allows an unauthenticated user to interact with the service API.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An unauthenticated user can potentially achieve escalation of privilege. The vulnerability has a high CVSS base score of 8.9, with high impact on confidentiality and availability, and low impact on integrity.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N). The attack is complex due to the high attack complexity (AC:H). The scope of the attack is changed (S:C).
