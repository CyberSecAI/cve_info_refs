Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2019-11410:

**CVE-2019-11410: Command Injection in Backup Module**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the backup module's restore function within FusionPBX. Specifically, the filename of an uploaded backup file is not properly sanitized before being used in a command executed by the system.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Command Injection:** The application uses user-supplied data (uploaded file name) to construct a shell command without proper sanitization or validation. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The code does not sanitize or validate the uploaded filename, which is then used in a system call.
    *   **Insufficient Privilege Separation:** The backup restore process allows an authenticated user with administrative privileges to execute arbitrary commands.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading a backup file with a malicious filename, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the server, leading to a full system compromise.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:**  The attacker uploads a specially crafted backup file via the web interface. The file's name contains shell command injection payloads.
    *   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the FusionPBX web interface's backup module.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with administrative privileges to access the backup module and upload files.
    *   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the FusionPBX web interface.

**Summary of Vulnerability**
The vulnerability exists in the backup module of FusionPBX where an authenticated user with administrative privileges can upload a file with a malicious filename. The application fails to properly sanitize or validate this filename, leading to command injection when the uploaded file is processed. This allows for arbitrary shell command execution and can lead to remote code execution.
