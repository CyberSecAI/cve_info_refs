- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JMX service in VMware GemFire and Tanzu GemFire for VMs does not properly restrict input, allowing for deserialization of crafted credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization of JMX credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A remote, authenticated attacker can send a crafted set of credentials to the JMX service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the JMX service.
